all right joey ,  be nice .  so does he have a hump ?  a hump and a hairpiece ?

who wasn &apos;t invited to the wedding .  
ooh ,  i was kinda hoping that wouldn &apos;t be an and are trying to figure out what is going on . ]

you guys .  
oh ,  god .  
you got screwed .  
i know ,  i know ,  i &apos;m such an idiot .  i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week .  i mean ,  how clean can teeth get ?  
well ,  you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers ,  say her -  
 that &apos;s one way !  me ,  i -  i went for the watch .  
ooh ,  steer clear of you .  
i &apos;m divorced !  i &apos;m only 26 and i &apos;m divorced !  
shut up !  
you must stop !   
that only took me an hour .  
look ,  ross ,  you gotta understand ,  between us we haven &apos;t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento .  you ,  however have had the love of a woman for four years .  four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out ,  and that is why we don &apos;t do it !  i don &apos;t think that was my point !  
you know what the scariest part is ?  what if there &apos;s only one woman for everybody ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean what if you get one woman -  and that &apos;s it ?  unfortunately in my case ,  there was only one woman -  for her .  .  .  
what are you talking about ?   &apos;one woman &apos; ?  that &apos;s like saying there &apos;s only one flavor of ice cream for you .  lemme tell you something ,  ross .  there &apos;s lots of flavors out there .  there &apos;s rocky road ,  and cookie dough ,  and bing !  cherry vanilla .  you could get  &apos;em with jimmies ,  or nuts ,  or whipped cream !  this is the best thing that ever happened to you !  you got married ,  you were ,  like ,  what ,  eight ?  welcome back to the world !  grab a spoon !  
i honestly don &apos;t know if i &apos;m hungry or horny .  
ever since she walked out on me ,  i ,  uh .  .  .

what you guys don &apos;t understand is ,  for us ,  kissing is as important as any part of it .  
yeah ,  right !  .  .  .  .  .  .  . y &apos;serious ?  
oh ,  yeah !  
everything you need to know is in that first kiss .  
absolutely .  
yeah ,  i think for us ,  kissing is pretty much like an opening act ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean it &apos;s like the stand - up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out .  
yeah ,  and - and it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t like the comedian ,  it &apos;s that - that .  .  .  that &apos;s not why we bought the ticket .  
the problem is ,  though ,  after the concert &apos;s over ,  no matter how great the show was ,  you girls are always looking for the comedian again ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean ,  we &apos;re in the car ,  we &apos;re fighting traffic .  .  .  basically just trying to stay awake .  
yeah ,  well ,  word of advice you &apos;re gonna find yourself sitting at home ,  listening to that album alone .  
well ,  she has issues .  
he &apos;s out banging other women over the head with a club ,  while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet !  
speaking of issues ,  isn &apos;t that your ex - wife ?   
yes ,  it is .  carol !  hi !  
okay ,  okay ,  yes ,  it is .   how about i &apos;ll ,  uh ,  catch up with you in the ice age .   
so .  
sorry .  you look good too .  
a lesbian ?  
marty &apos;s still totally paranoid .  oh ,  and ,  uh -

i &apos;ve already seen this one !   
 are you through with that ?  
yeah ,  sorry ,  the swallowing slowed me down .  
whose little ball of paper is this ?  !  
oh ,  uh ,  that would be mine .  see ,  i wrote a note to myself ,  and then i realised i didn &apos;t need it ,  so i balled it up and .  .  .    .  .  . now i wish i was dead .   
she &apos;s already fluffed that pillow .  .  .  monica ,  you know ,  you &apos;ve already fluffed that -    - but ,  it &apos;s fine !  
look  ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  guys ,  i just don &apos;t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have .  
yes ,  and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child &apos;s pillow .  
monica -  hi !  um ,  monica ,  you &apos;re scaring me .  i mean ,  you &apos;re like ,  you &apos;re like all chaotic and twirly .  and not - not in a good way .  
yeah ,  calm down .  you don &apos;t see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come .  
that &apos;s because as far as my parents are concerned ,  ross can do no wrong .  y &apos;see ,  he &apos;s the prince .  apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born .  
 ew ,  ew ,  ew ,  ew ew ew ew ew !  
what ?  
eeaagh !   
has anybody seen my engagement ring ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s beautiful .  
oh god ,  oh god ,  oh god oh god oh god oh god .  .  .  .

oh ,  like i wasn &apos;t dreading tomorrow enough ,  having to give it back to him .  .  .   &apos;hi barry !  remember me ?  i &apos;m the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family !  &apos; oh god and now i &apos;m gonna have to return the ring ,  without the ring ,  which makes it so much harder .  .  .  
easy rach ,  we &apos;ll find it .   won &apos;t we !  
alright ,  when &apos;d &apos;ya have it on last ?  
doy !  probably right before she lost it !  
you don &apos;t get a lot of  &apos;doy &apos; these days .  .  .

well now ,  how - how do you fit into this whole thing ?  
well ,  carol says she and susan want me to be involved ,  but if i &apos;m not comfortable with it ,  i don &apos;t have to be involved .  .  basically it &apos;s entirely up to me .  
she is so great !  i miss her .  
what does she mean by  &apos;involved &apos; ?  
i mean presumably ,  the biggest part of your job is done .  
anyway ,  they want me to go down to this -  sonogram thing with them tomorrow .  
so what are you gonna do ?  
i have no idea .  no matter what i do ,  though ,  i &apos;m still gonna be a father .
