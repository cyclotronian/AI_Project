monica ,  monica is great .  
yeah ,  isn &apos;t he ?  
you know what else ?  he &apos;s unbelievable in bed .  
ok ,  you can do this .  it &apos;s just like pulling off a band - aid .  just do it really fast ,  and then the wound is exposed .   
ok ,  i know this is gonna sound really stupid ,  but i feel that if i can do this ,  you know ,  if i can actually do my own laundry ,  there isn &apos;t anything i can &apos;t do .  
that does not sound stupid to me .  you know ,  it &apos;s like the first time i had to make dinner for myself ,  after carol left me ?   i &apos;m sorry ,  that &apos;s all the time we have .  next on ross .  .  .  uh - oh .

oh ,  rachel .

oh ,  alright .  the weirdest place would have to be .  .  .   .  .  .  oh ,  the foot of the bed .  
step back .  
we have a winner !  are out of the room . ] 
i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion ,  you know ,  where you have to have somebody right there ,  in the middle of a theme park .  
well ,  it was the only thing to do there that didn &apos;t have a line .  
there ,  well ,  see ?  barry wouldn &apos;t even kiss me on a miniature golf course .  
come on .  
no ,  he said we were holding up the people behind us .  
 and you didn &apos;t marry him because .  .  .  ?  
i mean ,  do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of .  .  .  
probably .  but you know ,  i &apos;ll tell you something .  passion is way overrated .  
yeah right .  
it is .  eventually ,  it kind of .  .  .  burns out .  but hopefully ,  what you &apos;re left with is trust ,  and security ,  and .  .  .  well ,  in the case of my ex - wife ,  lesbianism .  so ,  you know ,  for all of those people who miss out on that passion .  .  .  thing ,  there &apos;s all that other good stuff .  
 ok .  
but ,  um .  .  .  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be you .  
you don &apos;t .  
uh - uh .  see ,  i see .  .  .  .  big passion in your future .  
really ?  
mmmm .

oh ross ,  you &apos;re so great .    
it &apos;s never gonna happen .

no ,  no ,  no .  i &apos;m not in the zone .  
ross ,  you &apos;re mayor of the zone .  
i &apos;m taking my time ,  alright ?  i &apos;m laying the groundwork .  yeah .  i mean ,  every day i get just a little bit closer to .  .  .  
priesthood !  look ross ,  i &apos;m telling you ,  she has no idea what you &apos;re thinking .  if you don &apos;t ask her out soon you &apos;re going to end up stuck in the zone forever .  
i will ,  i will .  see ,  i &apos;m waiting for the right moment .   what ?  what ,  now ?  
yeeeeaaaahhh !  what &apos;s messing you up ?  the wine ?  the candles ?  the moonlight ?  you &apos;ve just got to go up to her and say ,   &apos;rachel ,  i think that .  .  .  &apos;

absolutely .  shoop ,  shoop ,  shoop .  only a hundred and two dollars to go .  
i thought it was $98 . 50 .  
yeah ,  well it was .  i ,  i broke a cup .  
well ,  i &apos;m off to carol &apos;s .  
ooh ,  ooh !  why don &apos;t we invite her ?  
no ,  she &apos;s at a faculty meeting .  
oh ,  i uh ,  just came by to pick up my skull .  well ,  not mine ,  but .  .  . susan come in .  
what &apos;s it look like ?  
yes ,  i &apos;m familiar with the concept .  we can just look for it .  
well ,  you know ,  you have to take a course .  otherwise ,  they don &apos;t let you do it .  
actually ,  i &apos;m reading it to the baby .  
what ,  you don &apos;t think they can hear sounds in there ?  
yeah ,  all the time .  i want the baby to know my voice .  
yeah ,  yeah ,  all the time .  
look ,  if she &apos;s talking to it ,  i just think that i should get some belly time too .  not that i believe any of this .  
oh ,  i believe it .  i think the baby can totally hear everything .  i can show you .  look ,  this will seem a little weird ,  but you put your head inside this turkey ,  and then we &apos;ll all talk ,  and you &apos;ll hear everything we say .  
i &apos;d just like to say that i &apos;m totally behind this experiment .  in fact ,  i &apos;d very much like to butter your head .

wait ,  wait ,  chandler ,  this is what you &apos;re havin &apos; for thanksgiving dinner ?  what ,  what ,  what is it with you and this holiday ?  
all right ,  i &apos;m nine years old .  
oh ,  i hate this story .  
we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner .  i have -  - and i remember this part vividly -  - a mouthful of pumpkin pie ,  and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they &apos;re getting divorced .  
oh my god .  
we did ?  
yeah ,  right .  
get out .  
really ?  you don &apos;t know what that means to me .  
 nothing .  
yeah .   oh .  
i just remembered ,  i have to do something .  
um ,  leave .  
so i guess you all saw it .  
saw what ?  
set another place for thanksgiving .  my entire family thinks i have vd .  
mmm ,  looking good .  ok ,  cider &apos;s mulling ,  turkey &apos;s turking ,  yams are yamming .   what ?  
i don &apos;t know .  it &apos;s just not the same without mom in the kitchen .  
all right ,  that &apos;s it .  you know what ?  just get out of my way and stop moping .  
that &apos;s closer .   
i got the tickets !  i got the tickets !  five hours from now ,  shoop ,  shoop ,  shoop .  
oh ,  you must stop shooping .  
ok ,  i &apos;m gonna get my stuff .  
chandler ,  will you just come in already ?  
no ,  i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment .   
look out ,  incoming pumpkin pie !  
ok ,  we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing ,  but that &apos;s not funny anymore .   
hey ,  monica ,  i got a question .  i don &apos;t see any tater tots .  
that &apos;s not a question .  
but my mom always makes them .  it &apos;s like a tradition .  you get a little piece of turkey on your fork ,  a little cranberry sauce ,  and a tot !  it &apos;s bad enough i can &apos;t be with my family because of my disease .  
all right ,  fine .  tonight &apos;s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps ,  and in the form of tots .  
ok ,  i &apos;m off to talk to my unborn child .   
ah !  
ok ,  mom never hit .   
 ok ,  all done .  
what ,  phoebe ,  did you whip the potatoes ?  ross needs lumps !  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  oh ,  i just ,  i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions .  
why would we do that ?  
well ,   &apos;cause then they &apos;d be like my mom used to make them ,  you know ,  before she died .  
ok ,  three kinds of potatoes coming up .  
ok ,  good - bye you guys .  thanks for everything .   oh ,  sorry !  oh ,  sorry !   
the most unbelievable thing has happened .  underdog has just gotten away .  
the balloon ?  
no ,  no ,  the actual cartoon character .  of course the balloon .  it &apos;s all over the news .  right before he reached macy &apos;s ,  he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park .  i &apos;m goin &apos; to the roof ,  who &apos;s with me ?  
i can &apos;t ,  i gotta go .  
come on .  an 80 - foot inflatable dog let loose over the city .  how often does that happen ?  
almost never .  
got the keys ?  or got the keys !  
anytime you &apos;re ready .  
just aim for the bump .  
so don &apos;t do it ,  it &apos;s fine .  you don &apos;t have to do it just because susan does it .  
i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park .  
yeah ,  but did they have to shoot him down ?  i mean ,  that was just mean .  
ok ,  right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside ,  juicy on the inside .  why are we standing here ?  
we &apos;re waiting for you to open the door .  you got the keys .  
no i don &apos;t .  
yes ,  you do .  when we left ,  you said ,   &quot; got the keys .  &quot;  
no i didn &apos;t .  i asked ,   &quot; got the ke - eys ?  &quot;  
no ,  no ,  no ,  you said ,   &quot; got the keys &quot;  .  
do either of you have the keys ?  
 the oven is on .  
oh ,  i gotta get my ticket !  
wait ,  wait ,  we have a copy of your key .  
well then get it ,  get it !  
that tone will not make me go any faster .  
 joey !  
look ,  you don &apos;t have to talk to it .  you can sing to it if you want .  
hi ,  how &apos;s it goin ?  
i did .  
keep singing !  keep singing !  
i felt it !  
nope ,  not that one .  
can you go any faster with that ?  
hey ,  i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys .  you do the math .  
why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway ?  
 for an emergency just like this .  
 all right ,  listen ,  smirky .  if it wasn &apos;t for you and your stupid balloon ,  i would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now .  but i &apos;m not .  
i swear you said you had the keys .  
no ,  i didn &apos;t .  i wouldn &apos;t say i had the keys unless i had the keys ,  and i obviously didn &apos;t have the keys .  
ooh ,  ok ,  that &apos;s it .  enough with the keys .  no one say keys .   
why would i have the keys ?  
aside from the fact that you said you had them ?  
but i didn &apos;t .  
well ,  you should have .  
why ?  
because !  
why ?  
because !  
why ?  because everything is my responsibility ?  isn &apos;t it enough that i &apos;m making thanksgiving dinner for everyone ?  you know ,  everyone wants a different kind of potatoes ,  so i &apos;m making different kinds of potatoes .  does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want ?  nooooo ,  no ,  no !   just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions ,  and mario gets his tots ,  and it &apos;s my first thanksgiving ,  and it &apos;s all burned ,  and ,  and i .  .  .  i .  .  .  
ok ,  monica ,  only dogs can hear you now ,  so ,  look ,  the door &apos;s open .  here we go .

  .  .  . my mother &apos;s ashes even her eyelashes are resting in a little yellow jar ,  and sometimes when it &apos;s breezy .  .  .   
no .  no ,  that &apos;s -  that &apos;s okay .  
well ,  c &apos;mon ,  if it &apos;s important enough to discuss while i &apos;m playing ,  then i assume it &apos;s important enough for everyone else to hear !  
noth -  i was -  i was just saying to my -  
 - hard quality .  and uh ,  while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way ,  you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace .  then ,  uh ,  that - that - that &apos;s when you started yelling .   
okay ,  we &apos;re gonna take a short break .   
come here ,  marcel .  sit here .   
pheebs ,  i can &apos;t believe he hasn &apos;t kissed you yet .  i mean god ,  by my sixth date with paolo ,  i mean he had already named both my breasts !   .  .  . ooh .  did i just share too much ?  
just a smidge .  
david &apos;s like ,  y &apos;know ,  scientist guy .  he &apos;s very methodical .  
i think it &apos;s romantic .  
me too !  oh !  did you ever see an officer and a gentleman ?  
yeah !  
well ,  he &apos;s kinda like the guy i went to see that with .  except ,  except he - he &apos;s smarter ,  and gentler ,  and sweeter .  .  .  i just -  i just wanna be with him all the time .  day and night ,  and night and day .  .  .  and special occasions .  .  .  
wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  i see where this is going ,  you &apos;re gonna ask him to new year &apos;s ,  aren &apos;t you .  you &apos;re gonna break the pact .  she &apos;s gonna break the pact .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no .  yeah ,  could i just ?  
yeah ,   &apos;cause i already asked janice .  
what ?  !  
c &apos;mon ,  this was a pact !  this was your pact !  
i snapped ,  okay ?  i couldn &apos;t handle the pressure and i snapped .  
yeah ,  but janice ?  that - that was like the worst breakup in history !  
i &apos;m not saying it was a good idea ,  i &apos;m saying i snapped !   
hi .  hi ,  sorry i &apos;m late .   
too many jokes .  .  .  must mock joey !  
nice shoes ,  huh ?   
aah ,  y &apos;killing me !   
ross !  he &apos;s playing with my spatulas again !  
okay ,  look ,  he &apos;s not gonna hurt them ,  right ?  
do you always have to bring him here ?  
i didn &apos;t wanna leave him alone .  alright ?  we -  we had our first fight this morning .  i think it has to do with my working late .  i said some things that i didn &apos;t mean ,  and he -  he threw some faeces .  .  .  
y &apos;know ,  if you &apos;re gonna work late ,  i could look in on him for you .  
oh ,  that &apos;d be great !  okay ,  but if you do ,  make sure it seems like you &apos;re there to see him ,  okay ,  and you &apos;re not like doing it as a favour to me .  
 .  .  . but ,  you can &apos;t actually test this theory ,  because today &apos;s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions .  
yuh .  
uh ,  that &apos;s definitely a ,  uh ,  valid question .  and ,  uh ,  the answer would be  yes .  yes i was .  but ,  see ,  i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment ,  because ,  well ,   &apos;cause it &apos;s you .  
right .  but ,  see ,  the longer i waited ,  the more phenomenal the kiss had to be ,  and now we &apos;ve reached a place where it &apos;s just gotta be one of those things where i just like .  .  .  sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it .  and ,  uh ,  i &apos;m not really a ,  uh ,  sweeping sorta fella .  
rrrreally .  
 .  .  . now ?  now ?  
okay ,  okay ,  okay .   y &apos;know what ,  this was just really expensive .   and i &apos;ll take -  this was a gift .   
okay ,  what the hell ,  what the hell .   you want me to actually throw you or you - you wanna just hop ?  
so tell me something .  what does the phrase  &apos;no date pact &apos; mean to you ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  okay .  it &apos;s just that chandler has somebody ,  and phoebe has somebody -  i thought i &apos;d ask fun bobby .

yep !  
see ,  rach ,  uh ,  see ,  i don &apos;t think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer .  i really don &apos;t .  i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process .  
no .  i just need to be by myself for a while ,  you know ?  i just got to figure out what i want 
uh ,  no ,  no ,  see ,  because not .  .  . not all guys are going to be a paolo .

can i just say one thing ?  
what ?  what ?  !  
that &apos;s a relatively open weave and i can still see your .  .  .  nipular areas .  
that &apos;s pretty much it .  
but you tell it really well ,  sweetie .  
okay .  i &apos;ll miss you .  
isn &apos;t he great ?  
he &apos;s so cute !  and he seems to like you so much .  
i know ,  i know .  so sweet .  .  .  and so complicated .  and for a shrink ,  he &apos;s not too shrinky ,  y &apos;know ?  
so ,  you think you &apos;ll do it on his couch ?  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know .  i think that &apos;s a little weird ,  y &apos;know ?  vinyl .  
okaaay .   any of you guys want anything else ?  
oh ,  yes ,  could i have one of those .   
no ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  we &apos;re all out of those .  anybody else ?  
did i ,  uh ,  did i miss something ?  
no ,  she &apos;s still upset because i saw her boobies .  
you what ?  wh what were you doing seeing her boobies ?  
it was an accident .  not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts .  
okay ,  okay ,  could we change the subject ,  please ?  
yeah ,   &apos;cause hello ,  these are not her boobies ,  these are her breasts .  
okay ,  pheebs ,  i was hoping for more of a change .  
y &apos;know ,  i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re so embarrassed ,  they were very nice boobies .  
nice ?  they were nice .  i mean ,  that &apos;s it ?  i mean ,  mittens are nice .  
you &apos;re so funny !  he &apos;s really funny !  i wouldn &apos;t wanna be there when when the laughter stops .  
oh ,  just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues .  y &apos;know ,  that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance .  
i mean hey !  i just met you ,  i don &apos;t know you from adam .   .  .  . only child ,  right ?  parents divorced before you hit puberty .  
it &apos;s textbook .   
hey !  hey ,  mr .  trib !  
just for a coupla days .  i got a job midtown .  i figure i &apos;m better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry .   i don &apos;t know this one .  
 what happened to the ,  uh ,  puppet guy ?  
gotta go .  i miss you too ,  i love you ,  but it &apos;s getting real late now 
her name &apos;s ronni .  she &apos;s a pet mortician .  
remember when you were a little kid ,  i used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships ?  
no ,  it &apos;s only been six years .  i just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you &apos;d know that i wasn &apos;t always such a terrible guy .   .  .  . joe .  y &apos;ever been in love ?  
then y &apos;haven &apos;t .  you &apos;re burning your tomatoes .  
joe ,  your dad &apos;s in love big time .  and the worst part of it is ,  it &apos;s with two different women .  
it &apos;s like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life .  he &apos;s like actually some spy ,  working for the c . i . a .   that &apos;d be cool .  .  .  .  this blows !  
i know ,  i mean ,  why can &apos;t parents just stay parents ?   why do they have to become people ?  why do they have .  .  .   why can &apos;t you stop staring at my breasts ?  
 what ?   what ?  
did you not get a good enough look the other day ?  
alright ,  alright .  we &apos;re all adults here ,  there &apos;s only one way to resolve this .  since you saw her boobies ,  i think ,  uh ,  you &apos;re gonna have to show her your peepee .  
y &apos;know ,  i don &apos;t see that happening ?  
c &apos;mon ,  he &apos;s right .  tit for tat .  
well i &apos;m not showing you my  &apos;tat .  &apos;  
hello ?  
 and rog .  
c &apos;mon up .  
 oh ,  good .  rog is here .  
what &apos;s the matter with rog ?  
yeah .  
oh ,  it &apos;s nothing ,  it &apos;s a little thing .  .  .  i hate that guy .  
what ,  so he was a little analytical .  that &apos;s what he does ,  y &apos;know ?  c &apos;mon ,  he &apos;s not that bad .   
i dunno .  maybe you wanted your marriage to fail .  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe maybe low self - esteem ,  maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling ,  maybe you .  .  .  
well ,  i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  it &apos;s conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents .  
that that &apos;s ridiculous !  i don &apos;t feel guilty for her failures !  
oh !  so you think i &apos;m a failure !  
isn &apos;t he good ?  
nonono ,  thatthat &apos;s not what i was saying .  .  .  
y &apos;know ,  all these years ,  i thought you were on my side .  but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they &apos;d keep liking you better !  
hey ,  i married a lesbian to make you look good !   
that &apos;s tough .  tough stuff .  c &apos;mon ,  pheebs ,  we &apos;re gonna catch that movie ,  we gotta get going .  
geez ,  we &apos;re gonna be late ,  sweetie .  .  .  
oh ,  okay .  listen ,  thanks for everything ,  mon .

oh no ,  not you ,  big joey .  oh my god ,  you &apos;re so much cuter than your pictures !   i - i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m ronni .  .  .  . cheese nip ?  
now ,  y &apos;see ,  most people ,  when their pets pass on ,  they want  &apos;em sorta laid out like they &apos;re sleeping .  but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose .  like ,  chasing their tail ,   or ,  uh ,  jumping to catch a frisbee .  
hey ,  joe .  
thank you .  uh .  .  .  
oh ,  where &apos;m i gonna stay ,  here ?  
 we &apos;ll go to a hotel .

thanks .  you &apos;re ,  uh ,  you &apos;re a good kid .  
c &apos;mon ,  i &apos;ll show you to my room .   .  .  . that sounds so weird when it &apos;s not followed by  &quot; no thanks ,  it &apos;s late .  &quot;  
what kinda change ?  
i can &apos;t do that !  
yeah ,  but this is 
hey ,  kicky .  what &apos;re you doing ?  
just trying to get comfortable .  i can &apos;t sleep in my underwear .

i &apos;ve been thinking .  y &apos;know ,  about how i &apos;m always seeing girls on top of girls .  .  .  
are they end to end ,  or tall like pancakes ?  
y &apos;know what i mean ,  about how i &apos;m always going out with all these women .  and i always figured ,  when the right one comes along ,  i &apos;d be able to be a stand - up guy and go the distance ,  y &apos;know ?  now i &apos;m looking at my dad ,  thinking .  .  .  
hey ,  you &apos;re not him .  you &apos;re you .  when they were all over you to go into your father &apos;s pipe - fitting business ,  did you cave ?  
no .  
no .  you decided to go into the out - of - work actor business .  now that wasn &apos;t easy ,  but you did it !  and i &apos;d like to believe that when the right woman comes along ,  you will have the courage and the guts to say  &quot; no thanks ,  i &apos;m married .  &quot;  
you really think so ?  
yeah .  i really do .  
thanks ,  chandler .

ma ,  i don &apos;t mean to be disrespectful ,  but .  .  .  what the hell are you talking about ?  !  i mean ,  what about you ?  and your father would look like sting .  and i &apos;ll tell you something else .  ever since that poodle - stuffer came along ,  he &apos;s been so ashamed of himself that he &apos;s been more attentive ,  he &apos;s been more loving .  .  .  i mean ,  it &apos;s like every day &apos;s our anniversary .  
i &apos;m .  .  . happy .  .  . for you ?  it the way it was .  
ma ,  i &apos;m sorry .  i just did what i thought you &apos;d want .  see her ?

wow .  
things sure have changed here on waltons mountain .  
so joey ,  you okay ?  
yeah ,  i guess .  it &apos;s just parents ,  after a certain point ,  you gotta let go .  even if you know better ,  you &apos;ve gotta let them make their own mistakes .  
just think ,  in a couple of years we get to turn into them .  
if i turn into my parents ,  i &apos;ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty - year - old boys ,  or .  .  .  i &apos;ll end up like my mom .

animal control .

marcel is an illegal exotic animal .  i &apos;m not allowed to have him in the city .  if they find him ,  they &apos;ll take him away from me .  
o - okay ,  now see ,  you never ever ever told us that .  .  .  
that &apos;s right ,  i .  .   &apos;cause i didn &apos;t expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment !   
 somebody called about a monkey ?

eh .  i thought that was an alp .  
well ,  high school was not my favourite time .  
i dunno ,  i loved high school .  y &apos;know ?  it was just four years of parties and dating and sex .  
yeah ,  well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys .  any sex i had would &apos;ve involved a major lifestyle choice .  
gosh ,  doesn &apos;t it seem like a million years ago ?  
i can &apos;t believe you would actually say that .  i would much rather be mr . peanut than mr . salty .  
no way !  mr . salty is a sailor ,  all right ,  he &apos;s got to be ,  like ,  thetoughest snack there is .  
i don &apos;t know ,  you don &apos;t wanna mess with corn nuts .  they &apos;re craaazy .  
 oh my god .  you guys !  you gotta come see this !  there &apos;s some creep out there with a telescope !  
i can &apos;t believe it !  he &apos;s looking right at us !  
oh ,  that is so sick .  
i feel violated .  and not in a good way .  
i am telling you ,  years from now ,  schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time .  it was unbelievable !  we could totally be ourselves ,  we didn &apos;t have to play any games .  .  .  
so have you called her yet ?  
let her know i like her ?  what are you ,  insane ?   it &apos;s the next day !  how needy do i want to seem ?   i &apos;m right ,  right ?  
i can &apos;t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people .  
oh ,  god ,  just do it !   call her !  stop being so testosteroney !  
which ,  by the way ,  is the real san francisco treat .   i got her machine .  
her answer machine ?  
no ,  interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up .  
so ,  uh ,  why didn &apos;t you say anything ?  
oh ,  no - no - no - no .  last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase  &quot; yes indeedy - o .  &quot;  
look look !  it &apos;s rachel and barry .  no ,  don &apos;t everybody look at once !  
okay ,  okay ,  what &apos;s going on ?  
okay ,  they &apos;re just talking .  .  .  
yeah ,  well ,  does he look upset ?  does he look like he was just told to shove anything ?  
no ,  no actually ,  he &apos;s smiling .  .  and .  .  .  oh my god ,  don &apos;t do that !  !  
what ?  what ?  what ?  !  
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon !   oh !  
oh !  .  .  .  right !  
hey rach !  
how &apos;d it go ?  
y &apos;know ,  it was ,  uh .  .  it was actually really great .  he took me to lunch at the russian tea room ,  and i had that chicken ,  where y &apos;know you poke it and all the butter squirts out .  .  .  
not a good day for birds .  .  .  
then we took a walk down to bendall &apos;s ,  and i told him not to ,  but he got me a little bottle of chanel .  .  .  
that &apos;s nice .  .  .  now ,  was that before or after you told him to stop calling ,  stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone ,  hmm ?  
right ,  .  .  well ,  .  .  we never actually got to that .  .  .  oh ,  it was just so nice to see him again ,  y &apos;know ?  it was comfortable ,  it was familiar .  .  .  it was just nice !  
that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s nice twice !  
rachel ,  what &apos;s going on ?  i mean isn &apos;t this the same barry who you left at the altar ?  
duh ,  where &apos;ve you been ?  
yeah ,  but it was different with him today !  and he wasn &apos;t ,  like ,  orthodontist guy ,  y &apos;know ?  i mean ,  we had fun !  is there anything wrong with that ?   
yes !  
why ?  
i have my reasons .  
okay ,  how about the fact that he &apos;s engaged to another woman ,  who just happens to be your ex - best friend ?  
yeah .  
nooo ,  it wasn &apos;t .  
 oh ,  danielle !  i wasn &apos;t expecting the machine .  .  .  give me a call when you get a chance .   bye - bye .   oh god !  
that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been working on for the past two hours ?  !  
hey ,  i &apos;ve been honing !  
what was with the dishes ?  
oh ,  uh .  .  i want her to think i might be in a restaurant .  .  y &apos;know ?  i might have some kind of life ,  like i haven &apos;t been sitting around here honing for the past few hours .  
 look look !  he &apos;s doing it again ,  the guy with the telescope !  
oh my god !   go away !   stop looking in here !  
great ,  now he &apos;s waving back .  
man ,  we gotta do something about that guy .  this morning ,  i caught him looking into our apartment .  it creeps me out !  i feel like i can &apos;t do stuff !  
what kinda stuff ?  
will you grow up ?  i &apos;m not talking about sexy stuff ,  but ,  like ,  when i &apos;m cooking naked .  
you cook naked ?  
yeah ,  toast ,  oatmeal .  .  .  nothing that spatters .   
what &apos;s the matter ?  
no ,  it was .  it was very very good .

all right miss green ,  everything looks fine .  .  .  yep ,  i think we &apos;re starting to see some real progress here .   
can i use your phone ?  
yeah .  .  uh ,  but for future reference ,  that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone .   
yes ,  it &apos;s working !  why isn &apos;t she calling me back ?  
maybe she never got your message .  
y &apos;know ,  if you want ,  you can call her machine ,  and if she has a lot of beeps ,  that means she probably didn &apos;t get her messages yet .  
y &apos;don &apos;t think that makes me seem a little .  .  .  
 .  .  . desperate ,  needy ,  pathetic ?  
ah ,  you obviously saw my personal ad .   
how many beeps ?  
she answered .  
y &apos;see ,  this is where you &apos;d use that  &apos;hello &apos; word we talked about .  
hey !  hi !  
how &apos;d he take it ?  
pretty well ,  actually .  .  .   
 uh ,  rach .  .  .  how come you have dental floss in your hair ?  
oh ,  do i ?

how could someone get a hold of your credit card number ?  
i have no idea .  but look how much they spent !  
monica ,  would you calm down ?  the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought .  
i know .  it &apos;s just such reckless spending .  
i think when someone steals your credit card ,  they &apos;ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind .  
wow ,  what a geek .  they spent $69 . 95 on a wonder mop .  
that &apos;s me .  
oh !  the yuk !  ross ,  he &apos;s doing it again !   
marcel ,  stop humping the lamp !  stop humping !  now marcel ,  come back -   come here ,  marcel -

ross ,  you &apos;ve got to do something about the humping .  
what ?  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s just a phase .  
well ,  that &apos;s what we said about joey .  .  .  
would you all relax ?  it &apos;s not that big a deal .  
 stop it !  marcel !  bad monkey !  
what ?  
oh ,  monica .  you are not still going over that thing .  
this woman &apos;s living my life .  
what ?  
she &apos;s living my life ,  and she &apos;s doing it better than me !  look at this ,  look .  she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see .  she ,  she buys clothes from stores that i &apos;m intimidated by the sales people .  she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies .  
you &apos;re not an artist .  
yeah ,  well i might be if i had the supplies !  i mean ,  i could do all this stuff .  only i don &apos;t .  
oh ,  monica ,  c &apos;mon ,  you do cool things .  
oh really ?  okay ,  let &apos;s compare ,  shall we .

joey .  .  .  switzerland ?   
plus ,  y &apos;know ,  i think it should be joe .  y &apos;know ,  joey makes me sound like i &apos;m ,  i dunno ,  this big .   which i &apos;m not .  
joe .  .  . joe .  .  . joe .  .  . stalin ?  
stalin .  .  . stalin .  .  . do i know that name ?  it sounds familiar .  
well ,  it does not ring a bell with me .  .  .  
 joe stalin .  y &apos;know ,  that &apos;s pretty good .  
might wanna try joseph .   
joseph stalin .  i think you &apos;d remember that !  
hey .  
hey .  
hi .   hi ,  uh ,  yes ,  this is monica geller .  um ,  i believe i &apos;m taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were .  
what are you doing ?  
 alright ,  great .  thanks a lot .   i &apos;m going to tap class .  
what ,  what ,  so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card ?  
this woman &apos;s got my life ,  i should get to see who she is .  
go to the post office !  i &apos;m sure her picture &apos;s up !   .  .  . okay ,  monica ,  y &apos;know what ,  honey ,  you &apos;re kinda losing it here !  i mean ,  this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing .  
what d &apos;you think ?  
lotsa things .   
may i help you ?  
you don &apos;t observe a dance class .  you dance a dance class .  spare shoes are over there .  
what does she mean ?  
i think she means   &apos;you dance a dance class &apos; .  oh ,  c &apos;mon ,  c &apos;mon .   
 people !  last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class .  let &apos;s not have that happen again !  
let &apos;s get started .  five ,  six ,  a - five six seven eight .  .  .   
okay ,  i &apos;m not getting this !  
 i &apos;m totally getting it !  
did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated ?   
alright people ,  now everyone grab a partner .   
okay .  and ,  my ,  dead ,  mother ,  says ,  you ,  are ,  it .  i &apos;m with rachel .  
well that &apos;s all right ,  you can come up to the front and dance with me .  
hi .  i &apos;m monica .  
 monana ?  
yeah .  it &apos;s dutch .  something in dutch) 
 hi .  
where &apos;ve you been ?  
at the vet .  
she &apos;s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones ,  is she ?  
she says marcel &apos;s humping thing &apos;s not a phase .  apparently he &apos;s reached sexual maturity .  
 hey !  he beat ya .  
she says as time goes on ,  he &apos;s gonna start getting agressive and violent .  
so what does this mean ?  
i can &apos;t believe it ,  ross .  this sucks !  
i don &apos;t get it ,  i mean ,  you just got him .  how can he be an adult already ?  
i know .  i know .  i mean ,  one day ,  he &apos;s this little thing ,  and before you know it ,  he &apos;s this little thing i can &apos;t get off my leg .  
isn &apos;t there any way you can keep him ?  
no ,  no .  the vet says unless he &apos;s in a place where he has regular access to some .  .  .  monkey lovin ,  &apos; he &apos;s just gonna get vicious .  i &apos;ve just gotta get him into a zoo .  
how do you get a monkey into a zoo ?  
i know that one !   .  .  . no ,  that &apos;s popes into a volkswagen .  
well ,  we &apos;re applying to a lot of them .  naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos ,  y &apos;know ,  like ,  uh ,  san diego .  .  .  right ?  but that might just be a pipe dream ,  because ,  y &apos;know ,  he &apos;s out of state .  uh ,  my vet ,  uh ,  knows someone at miami ,  so that &apos;s a possibility .  
yeah ,  but that &apos;s like two blocks away from the beach .  i mean ,  it &apos;s a total party zoo .   
hey .  we found her ,  we found the girl .  
what ?  
did you call the cops ?  
nope .  we took her to lunch .  
ah .  your own brand of vigilante justice .  
what ?  !  are you insane ?  this woman stole from you .  she stole .  she &apos;s a stealer .  
y &apos;know what ?  after you &apos;re with this woman for like ten minutes ,  you forget all that .  i mean ,  she is this astounding person ,  with this ,  with this amazing spirit .  
yeah ,  which she probably stole from some cheerleader .  
 .  .  . take off their hats !  
no way .  no way did you do this .  
it was so wild .  we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen .  only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor !  have breasts .  .  .  
 .  .  . they threw us out !  i was thrown out of a hotel !  me !  
go monana !  well ,  you ladies are not the only ones living the dream .  i get to go pour coffee for people i don &apos;t know .  don &apos;t wait up .   
 &apos;scuse me ?  memories and make complete fools of ourselves .  whaddya say ?  
nononononono .  think who you &apos;re dealing with here .  i mean ,  i &apos;m not like you .  i - i can &apos;t even stand in front of a tap class .  
what ?  
right .  till i bought a blow dryer ,  then i was shunned .  changed my life .  did you ever see dead poets &apos; society ?  
uh - huh .  i mean ,  that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can &apos;t be in the play ?  what was that ?  !  it &apos;s like ,  kid ,  wait a year ,  leave home ,  do some community theatre .  i walked out of there and i thought ,   &apos;now ,  that &apos;s two hours of my life that i &apos;m never getting back .  &apos; and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do .  
 oh god .   we didn &apos;t get into scranton .   that was like our safety zoo .  they take like dogs and cows .  see ?  i don &apos;t know who this is harder on ,  me or him .  
i &apos;d say that chair &apos;s taking the brunt .

well i ,  i don &apos;t know .  why ?  
he can hold a banana ,  if that &apos;s whatcha mean .  .  .

well ,  sure ,  but can you play it on a plane ?   
oh ,  it &apos;s so pretty .  this must have cost him a fortune .  
i can &apos;t believe he did this .

no !  none !  i mean ,  my first night in the city ,  he mentioned something did he say ?  i mean ,  does he ,  like ,  want to go out with me ?  
well ,  given that he &apos;s desperately in love with you ,  he probably wouldn &apos;t mind getting a cup of coffee or something .  
ross ?  all this time ?  well ,  i &apos;ve got to talk to him .   
 h - he &apos;s in china !

rachel ,  what &apos;re you gonna say to him ?  
i - i - i don &apos;t know .  
well then maybe you shouldn &apos;t go .  
he &apos;s right ,  cause if you &apos;re just gonna ,  like ,  break his heart ,  that &apos;s the kind of thing that can wait .  
yeah ,  but if it &apos;s good news ,  you should tell him now .  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe i &apos;ll know when i see him .

i don &apos;t know .  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i thought about it all the way there ,  and i thought about it all the way back .  .  .  and ,  uh ,  oh ,  you guys ,  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s ross .  y &apos;know what i mean ?  i mean ,  it &apos;s ross .  
i don &apos;t know ,  i mean ,  this is just my initial gut feeling .  .  .  but i &apos;m thinking .  .  .  oh ,  i &apos;m thinking it &apos;d be really great .  
oh my god ,  me too !  oh !  oh ,  we &apos;d be like friends - in - law !  y &apos;know what the best part is ?  the best part is that you already know everything about him !  i mean ,  it &apos;s like starting on the fifteenth date !  
yeah ,  but ,  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  it would be like starting on the fifteenth date .  
another good point .  
no ,  i mean ,  i mean ,  when you &apos;re at the fifteenth date ,  y &apos;know ,  you &apos;re already in a very relationshippy place .  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  you &apos;re committed .  
 huh ?  
well ,  i mean ,  then what happens if it doesn &apos;t work out ?  
why isn &apos;t it working out ?  
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  sometimes it doesn &apos;t .  
is he not cute enough for you ?  
no !  
does he not make enough money ?  
no ,  i &apos;m just .  .  .  .  
maybe there &apos;s someone else .  
wha .  .  .  
is there ?  is there someone else ?  
no !  there is .  .  there is noone else !  
hey ,  big .  .  .  
shhhh !  
  .  .  . spender .  
she &apos;s still asleep .  
so how &apos;d it go ?  
oh ,  it was amazing .  you know how you always think you &apos;re great in bed ?  
the fact that you &apos;d even ask that question shows how little you know me .  
well ,  it &apos;s like ,  last night ,  i couldn &apos;t do the thing that usually makes me great .  so i had to do all this other stuff .  and the response i got .  .  .  man ,  oh man ,  it was like a ticker tape parade !  
yes ,  i know ,  as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route .  
it was amazing !  and not just for her .  .  .  uh - uh .  for me ,  too .  it &apos;s like ,  all of a sudden ,  i &apos;m blind .  but all my other senses are heightened ,  y &apos;know ?  it &apos;s like .  .  .  i was able to appreciate it on another level .  
i didn &apos;t know you had another level .  
hey ,  great skirt !  birthday present ?  
yeah .  
oh ,  from who ?  
from you .  i exchanged the blouse you got me .  
well ,  it &apos;s the thought .  hey ,  doesn &apos;t ross &apos;s flight get in in a couple hours ?  at gate 27 - b ?  
uh ,  yeah .  uh ,  monica ,  y &apos;know ,  honey ,  i &apos;ve been thinking about it and i &apos;ve decided thisthis whole ross thing ,  it &apos;s just not a good idea .  
oh ,  why ?  
because ,  i feel like i wouldn &apos;t just be going out with him .  i would be going out with all of you .  oh ,  and there would just be all this pressure ,  and i don &apos;t wanna .  .  .  
 no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no pressure ,  no pressure !  
monica ,  nothing has even happened yet ,  and you &apos;re already so .  .  .  
i am not  &apos;so &apos; !  ok ,  i was a teensy bit weird at first ,  but .  .  .  i &apos;ll be good .  i promise .   
it &apos;s me ,  carl .  
c &apos;mon up .  
seven hundred bucks !  
alright ,  you did it !  do we have any fruit ?  
man ,  hell of a two weeks ,  huh ?  y &apos;know what ,  though ?  i really feel like i learned something .  
really ?  so ,  you &apos;re gonna stick with this  &apos;it &apos;s all for her &apos; thing ?  
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; ,  if i see one more picture of ed begley ,  jr .  in that stupid electric car ,  i &apos;m gonna shoot myself !  i mean ,  don &apos;t get me wrong .  .  .  i &apos;m not against environmental issues per se .  .  .  .  it &apos;s just that guy !   
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d rather go out with him than me .  
would you excuse me ,  please ?  i &apos;m trying to have a date here .  
fine ,  just stop thinking about me .   
can &apos;t do it ,  can you ?  
so i &apos;m thinking about you .  so what ?  
i don &apos;t get it .  what do you see in this guy ,  anyway ?  
i mean ,  come on ,  buddy ,  get a real car !  
rachel ,  come on .  give us a chance .  
ross ,  it &apos;s too hard .  
no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  why ,  because it might get weird for everyone else ?  who cares about them .  this is about us .  look ,  i - i &apos;ve been in love with you since ,  like ,  the ninth grade .  
ross ,  you &apos;re like my best friend .  
i know .  
if we broke up ,  and i lost you .  .  .  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  what makes you think we &apos;re gonna break up ?  
well ,  have you been involved with someone where you haven &apos;t broken up ?  
 no .  but .  .  .  it only has to happen once .  look ,  you and i both know we are perfect for each other ,  right ?  i mean .  .  .  so ,  the only question is .  .  .  are you attracted to me ?  
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i mean ,  i &apos;ve never looked at you that way before .  
well ,  start looking .   
exactly !  and you just know i &apos;m gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic !  
heh .  .  .  y &apos;know ?  
what ?  
for god &apos;s sake ,  will you let it go ?  there &apos;s no rachel !   
oh ,  thanks ,  sweetie .  
really ?  
you don &apos;t think they &apos;ll judge and ridicule me ?  
no ,  no ,  they will .  i just .  .  .  uh .  .  .  
ok ,  so this is pretty much what &apos;s happened so far .  ross was in love with rachel since ,  you know ,  forever ,  but every time he tried to tell her ,  something kind of got in the way ,  like cats ,  and italian guys .  finally chandler was like  &quot; forget about her &quot;  but when ross was in china on his dig ,  chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel .  she was like ,   &quot; oh my god .  &quot;  so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back ,  but what she didn &apos;t know was ,  that ross was getting off the plane with another woman .  uh - oh !  so ,  that &apos;s pretty much everything you need to know .  but ,  enough about us .  so ,  how &apos;ve you been ?  opening credits  
oh my god .  oh my god .   excuse me .  move !  move !  emergency !  excuse me !

well ,  ross and i were in grad school together .  
but we haven &apos;t seen each other since then .  well i land in china ,  guess who &apos;s in charge of the dig .

so what the hell happened to you in china ?  i mean ,  when last we left you ,  you were totally in love with ,  you know .  
i know ,  i know i was ,  but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it &apos;s never gonna happen ,  move on .  you know whose voice that was ?  
god ?  
it was you ,  pal .  
well ,  maybe it was god ,  doing me .  
look ,  you were right .  she looks at me and sees a friend ,  that &apos;s all .  but then i met julie ,  and i don &apos;t know ,  we &apos;re havin &apos; a great time .  and i have to say ,  i never would &apos;ve gone for it with her if it hadn &apos;t been for you .  
well ,  you owe me one ,  big guy .

but .  .  .  
go - go - go - go ,  come on !   so uh ,  what did you find out ?  
he said .  .  . he said ,  he said that they &apos;re having a great time .  i &apos;m sorry .  but ,  the silver lining ,  if you wanna see it ,  is that he made the decision all by himself !  without any outside help whatsoever .  
how is that the silver lining ?  
ironically ,  these are the guys who were picked last in gym .   
pheebes ,  you know what i &apos;m thinking ?  
oh ,  ok .  how ,  it &apos;s been so long since you &apos;ve had sex ,  you &apos;re wondering if they &apos;ve changed it ?  
no ,  although now that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .

well ,  i was thinking ,  that you gave the guys such great haircuts ,  i thought ,  maybe you &apos;d like to do mine ?

hey ,  chandler ,  when you see frankie ,  tell him joey tribbiani says hello .  he &apos;ll know what it means .

 you know it &apos;s funny ,  the last time paulo was here ,  my hair was so much shorter and cuter .  
all right .  ok ,  but ,  but !  you have to promise that you will not be all like control - y and bossy and monica about it .  
i promise .  
all right ,  that &apos;s it ,  i quit .  
what ?  i didn &apos;t say anything .  
yeah ,  but this  isn &apos;t the face of a person who trusts a person .  ok ,  this  is the face of a person who ,  you know ,  doesn &apos;t trust a person .  
i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;m sorry ,  phoebe .  it &apos;s just a little shorter than what we had discussed .  
would you relax ?  i know what i am doing .  this is how he wears it .

how &apos;s the hair ?  
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you ,  ross ,  it doesn &apos;t look good .  i put a clip on one side ,  which seems to have stopped the curling .  
can we see her ?  
your hair looks too good ,  i think it would upset her .  ross ,  why don &apos;t you come on in .  
yeah .    
how &apos;re you doing ?  
i &apos;m okay .  
ooh ,  that bad ,  huh ?

when i saw him get off that plane with her ,  i really thought i hit rock bottom .  but today ,  it &apos;s like there &apos;s rock bottom ,  50 feet of crap ,  then me .  
you gotta tell ross how you feel .  
come on .  how can i just tell him ?  what about julie ?

 yo ,  paisan !  can i talk to you for a sec ?   your tailor is a very bad man !  
frankie ?  what &apos;re you talking about ?

phoebe ,  that is juice ,  squeezed from a person .  
what is the big deal ?   
what did you just do ?  
ok ,  would people stop drinking the breast milk ?  
you won &apos;t even taste it ?  
no !  
not even if you just pretend that it &apos;s milk ?  
hey ,  where is everybody ?  
they took ben to the park .  where &apos;ve you been ?  
just out .  had some lunch ,  just me ,  little quality time with me .  thanks for your jacket .  
oh ,  no problem .  you can borrow it ,  by the way .   here are your keys ,  hon .

mon ,  if uh you were at lunch alone ,  how come it cost you uh 53 dollars ?

and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket ?  
that is an excellent excellent question .  that is excellent .  
monica ,  what is with you ?  who &apos;d you have lunch with ?  
judy .  
who ?  
julie .  
what ?  !  
jody !  
you were with julie ?  
look ,  when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother &apos;s girlfriend .  and then ,  one thing led to another and ,  before i knew it ,  we were .  .  . shopping .  
oh .  oh my god .  
honey ,  wait .  we only did it once .  it didn &apos;t mean anything to me .  
yeah ,  right .  sure !  
really ,  rachel ,  i was thinking of you the whole time .  look ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  all right .  i never meant for you to find out !  
oh ,  please ,  you wanted to get caught .   
that is not true !  
oh ,  so you just sort of happened to leave it in here ?  
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid ?  
how did we do ?  
oh ,  i tasted ben &apos;s milk ,  and ross freaked out .  
why &apos;d you freak out ?  
this should be fun .  
no ,  no ,  carol .  there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .  i just ,  i just don &apos;t think breast milk is for adults .  
ross ,  you &apos;re being silly .  i &apos;ve tried it ,  it &apos;s no big deal .  just taste it .   
 that would be no .  
come on .  it doesn &apos;t taste bad .  
cantaloupe juice .  
exactly .  
uh huh .  
you can keep saying it ,  but it won &apos;t stop being true .  
howdy .  
 gimme a box a juice .  well ,  they switched me over to hombre .  
well ,  maybe it &apos;s because of the way you &apos;re dressed .  
or maybe it &apos;s because this guy &apos;s doing so good they wanna put more people on it .   you should see this guy ,  chandler ,  he goes through two bottles a day .  
 what do you care ?  you &apos;re an actor .  this is your day job .  this isn &apos;t supposed to mean anything to you .  
i know ,  but ,  i was the best ,  you know ?  i liked being the best .   i don &apos;t know .  maybe i should just get outta the game .  they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese .  
 all right ,  say you do that .  you know sooner or later somebody &apos;s gonna come along that slices a better cheddar .  and then where &apos;re you gonna run ?  
yeah i guess you &apos;re right .  
you &apos;re damn right i &apos;m right .  i say you show this guy what you &apos;re made of .  i say you stand your ground .  i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie .  
i &apos;m gonna do it .   
i don &apos;t know what else to say .  
well that works out good ,  because i &apos;m not listening .  
i feel terrible ,  i really do .  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  did my back hurt your knife ?  
rachel ,   say that i &apos;m friends with her ,  we spend some time together .  is that so terrible ?  
yes .  
it &apos;s that terrible ?  
yes .  monica ,  you don &apos;t get it .  it &apos;s bad enough that she &apos;s stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with ,  but now ,  she &apos;s actually  ,  but now she &apos;s actually stealing you .  
me ?  what are you talking about ?  nobody could steal me from you .  i mean ,  just because i &apos;m friends with her doesn &apos;t make me any less friends with you .  i mean ,   you &apos;re my .  .  . we &apos;re ,  we &apos;re .  .  . oh ,  i love you .  
i love you too .   
you guys ,  um i know that this really doesn &apos;t have anything to do with me ,  but um i love you guys too .   oh ,  i really needed that .   
look ,  i know that you &apos;re in a place right now where you really need to hate julie &apos;s guts ,  but she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .  i mean ,  she was just a girl who met a guy ,  and now they go out .  i really think that if you gave her a chance ,  you &apos;d like her .  would you just give that a chance ,  for me ?  
 i &apos;d do anything for you ,  you know that .  
 i &apos;d do anything for you .   
mornin &apos; .   i said ,  mornin &apos; .  
 my god ,  what happened ?  
so .  
i know ,  i probably shouldn &apos;t even tell you this ,  but i &apos;m pretty much totally intimidated by you .  
yes .  oh my god ,  are you kidding ?  ross is so crazy about you ,  and i really wanted you to like me ,  and ,  it &apos;s probably me being totally paranoid ,  but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don &apos;t .  
oy .  
thanks .  hey ,  listen ,  would you like to go to a movie sometime or something ?  
i &apos;d love it too .  shoot ,  i gotta go .  so ,  i &apos;ll talk to you later .

they were huge .  when she sneezed ,  bats flew out of them .  
come on ,  they were not that huge .  
i &apos;m tellin &apos; you ,  she leaned back; i could see her brain .  
how many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things ?  
hold it ,  hold it .  i gotta side with chandler on this one .  when i first moved to the city ,  i went out a couple of times with this girl ,  really hot ,  great kisser ,  but she had the biggest adam &apos;s apple .  it made me nuts .  
 you or me ?  
i got it .  uh ,  joey ,  women don &apos;t have adam &apos;s apples .  
yeah .  
you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason .  
maureen rosilla .  
 &quot; cause she doesnt hate yanni ,  &quot;  is not a real reason .   
you &apos;re doing it again .

i know .  i was sweeping yesterday .  it coulda been me .  
ok ,  it &apos;s very faint ,  but i can still sense him in the building .   go into the light ,  mr . _heckles !  
ok ,  phoebe .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  but sometimes they need help .   that &apos;s fine .  go ahead and scoff .  you know there &apos;re a lot of things that i don &apos;t believe in ,  but that doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re not true .  
such as ?  
like crop circles ,  or the bermuda triangle ,  or evolution ?  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  what ,  you don &apos;t ,  uh ,  you don &apos;t believe in evolution ?  
nah .  not really .  
you don &apos;t believe in evolution ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  it &apos;s just ,  you know .  .  . monkeys ,  darwin ,  you know ,  it &apos;s a ,  it &apos;s a nice story ,  i just think it &apos;s a little too easy .  
too easy ?  too .  .  . the process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single - celled organisms ,  is - is too easy ?  
yeah ,  i just don &apos;t buy it .  
uh ,  excuse me .  evolution is not for you to buy ,  phoebe .  evolution is scientific fact ,  like ,  like ,  like the air we breathe ,  like gravity .  
ok ,  don &apos;t get me started on gravity .  
you uh ,  you don &apos;t believe in gravity ?  
well ,  it &apos;s not so much that you know ,  like i don &apos;t believe in it ,  you know ,  it &apos;s just .  .  . i don &apos;t know ,  lately i get the feeling that i &apos;m not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed .   
there she is .  and over there ,  that &apos;s the other one .  this is mr .  buddy boyle ,  mr . _heckles &apos; attorney .  he &apos;d like to talk to you .  
what can we do for you ?  wants to leave all his earthly possessions to  &quot; the noisy girls in the apartment above mine .  &quot;  
well ,  what about his family ?  
ok ,  so let &apos;s talk money .  noisy girl number one ,   you be noisy girl number two .  
would you look at this dump ?  he hated us .  this is his final revenge !  
have you ever seen so much crap ?  
actually ,  i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap 
check this out .  can i have this ?    
how can you not believe in evolution ?  
just don &apos;t .  look at this funky shirt !  
pheebs ,  i have studied evolution my entire adult life .  ok ,  i can tell you ,  we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species ,  ok ?  you can literally see them evolving through time .  
really ?  you can actually see it ?  
you bet .  in the u . s .  ,  china ,  africa ,  all over .  
see ,  i didn &apos;t know that .  
well ,  there you go .  
huh .  so now ,  the real question is ,  who put those fossils there ,  and why ?  
 hey ,  look at this .   &quot; my big book of grievances .  &quot;  
hey ,  there &apos;s me !  april 17th .  excessive noise .  italian guy comes homes with a date .  hey chandler ,  look ,  you &apos;re in here too .

monica ,  monica ,  look at this lamp .   is this tacky or what ?  we have to have this .  
rache ,  i think we have enough regular lamps .

it doesn &apos;t go with any of my stuff .  
well ,  what about my stuff ?  
you don &apos;t have any stuff .  
you still think of it as your apartment ,  don &apos;t you ?  
no .  
yes you do .  you think of it as your apartment ,  and i &apos;m just somebody who rents a room .  
mmmmm .  
ok ,  while you  &quot; mmm &quot;  on it for awhile ,  i &apos;m gonna go find a place for my new lamp .  
ok ,  pheebs .   see how i &apos;m making these little toys move ?  opposable thumbs .  without evolution ,  how do you explain opposable thumbs ?  
maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts .  
please tell me you &apos;re joking .  
look ,  can &apos;t we just say that you believe in something ,  and i don &apos;t .  
no ,  no ,  pheebs ,  we can &apos;t ,  ok ,  because 
what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you ?  no ,  what &apos;s that all about ?  i think ,  i think maybe it &apos;s time you put ross under the microscope .  
 is there blood coming out of my ears ?  
check it out ,  check it out .  heckles &apos; high school yearbook .  
wow ,  he looks so normal .

funniest ?  heckles ?  
that &apos;s what it says .  
wow ,  heckles was voted class clown ,  and so was i .   he was right .  would you listen to that ?

uh - oh .  it &apos;s scary scientist man .  
ok ,  phoebe ,  this is it .  in this briefcase i carry actual scientific facts .  a briefcase of facts ,  if you will .  some of these fossils are over 200 million years old .  
ok ,  look ,  before you even start ,  i &apos;m not denying evolution ,  ok ,  i &apos;m just saying that it &apos;s one of the possibilities .  
it &apos;s the only possibility ,  phoebe .  
ok ,  ross ,  could you just open your mind like this much ,  ok ?   wasn &apos;t there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat ?  and ,  up until like what ,  50 years ago ,  you all thought the atom was the smallest thing ,  until you split it open ,  and this like ,  whole mess of crap came out .  now ,  are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can &apos;t admit that there &apos;s a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this ?   
there might be a teeny tiny possibility .  
i can &apos;t believe you caved .  
what ?  
you just abandoned your whole belief system .  i mean ,  before ,  i didn &apos;t agree with you ,  but at least i respected you .  how ,  how ,  how are you going to go into work tomorrow ?  how ,  how are you going to face the other science guys ?  how ,  how are you going to face yourself ?   oh !  that was fun .  so who &apos;s hungry ?  
i am .  let me just get my coat .   
 what happened ?  !  what happened ?  !  
ok ,  all right .  it was an accident ,  i swear ,  all right .  i was putting on my jacket ,  and the thing ,  and the lamp ,  and it broke .  
oh ,  please ,  monica .  you &apos;ve always hated my lamp ,  and then ,  all of a sudden ,  it &apos;s just magically broken ?  
phoebe ,  tell her !

chandler ,  you &apos;re not gonna die alone .  
janice was my safety net ,  ok ?  and now i have to get a snake .  
uh huh .  why is that ?  
if i &apos;m gonna be an old ,  lonely man ,  i &apos;m gonna need a thing ,  you know ,  a hook ,  like that guy on the subway who eats his own face .  so i figure i &apos;ll be crazy man with a snake ,  yknow .  crazy snake man .  and i &apos;ll get more snakes ,  call them my babies ,  kids will walk past my place ,  they will run .   &quot; run away from crazy snake man ,  &quot;  they &apos;ll shout !  
you have got to get over this .  you &apos;re not gonna end up alone .  
of course i am .  i reject anyone who &apos;s crazy enough to actually go out with me ,  and then i bitch about the fact that there aren &apos;t any great women out there .  
chandler ,  you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with .  
you are not a freak .  you &apos;re a guy .  
she &apos;s right .  she &apos;s right .  you are no different than the rest of them .  
wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  yes he is .  you are totally different .  
in a bad way ?  
no ,  honey ,  in a wonderful way .  you know what you want now .  most guys don &apos;t even have a clue .  you are ready to take risks ,  you are ready to be vulnerable ,  and intimate with someone .  
yeah .  you &apos;re not gonna end up alone .  
chandler ,  you called janice !  that &apos;s how much you wanted to be with someone !  
you made it !  
you &apos;re there !

hey ,  uh ,  you can &apos;t recycle yearbooks ,  can you ?

so ,  so how did it happen ?  
well ,  i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on .  
and what did he say ?  
he said that ,  um ,  he understands how sex can be like ,  a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all ,  y &apos;know ,  like ,   &apos;ohh ,  is he gonna call me the next day &apos; and ,  y &apos;know ,   &apos;where is this going &apos; and ,  ya know ,  blah - la - la - la - la .  so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious .  
wow .  
yeah ,  so i said ,   &quot; okay ,  relax please ,  &quot;  y &apos;know ,  i mean ,  sex can be just about two people right there in the moment ,  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s ,  if he wants to see me again he can call and if not ,  that &apos;s fine too .  so after a looooot of talking .   .   .  i convinced him .  
let me get this straight .  he got you to beg to sleep with him ,  he got you to say he never has to call you again ,  and he got you thinking this was a great idea .  
um - hum .  
hi .  
i didn &apos;t get a cat .  
oh ,  that &apos;s um ,  interesting .  
no ,  no it &apos;s not interesting .  okay ,  it &apos;s very ,  very not interesting .  in fact it &apos;s actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting .  
all right ,  i got it ross .  
you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me .  
 what ?  
i was doing great with julie before i found out about you .  
hey ,  i was doin &apos; great before i found out about you .  you think it &apos;s easy for me to see you with julie ?  
then you should have said something before i met her .  
i didn &apos;t know then .  and how come you never said anything to me .  
there was never a good time .  
right ,  you ,  you only had a year .  we only hung out every night .  
not ,  not ,  not every night .  you know ,  and .  .  .  and it &apos;s not like i didn &apos;t try ,  rachel ,  but things got in the way ,  y &apos;know ?  like ,  like italian guys or ex - fiancs or ,  or ,  or italian guys .  
hey ,  there was one italian guy ,  okay ,  and do you even have a point ?  
the point is i .  .  .  i don &apos;t need this right now ,  okay .  it ,  it &apos;s too late ,  i &apos;m with somebody else ,  i &apos;m happy .  this ship has sailed .  
yeah ,  what &apos;re you saying ,  you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me ?  
hey ,  i &apos;ve been doin &apos; it since the ninth grade ,  i &apos;ve gotten pretty damn good at it .  
all right ,  fine ,  you go ahead and you do that ,  all right ross .

well ,  thanks .  
i mean ,  especially considering how tough it &apos;s been for you to find work .  
well ,  you know .  
you know ,  i mean ,  you can &apos;t tell your parents you were fired because they &apos;d be disappointed .  
 uh - huh .

tongue ?  
yeah .  
 there are no jobs .  there are no jobs for me .  
there &apos;s an ad for a naked chef ?

ya know i remember my father ,  all dressed up in the red suit ,  the big black boots ,  and the patent leather belt ,  sneakin around downstairs .  he didn &apos;t want anybody to see him but he &apos;d be drunk so he &apos;d stumble ,  crash into something and wake everybody up .

y &apos;know ,  maybe this isn &apos;t such a big deal .  y &apos;know ,  i mean ,  the way that i see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex .  y &apos;know ,  i mean ,  throw in a tree and a fat guy and you &apos;ve got christmas .  
didn &apos;t you used to call it the little major ?  
dysprosium .  
phoebe ,  what the hell are you talking about ?  other than their names being similar ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i do not see what you &apos;re seeing .   
i know what your problem is .  
um - hum ,  you &apos;re jealous .

bobby and i are going away for the weekend ,  remember ?

i &apos;ll take one .  sometimes i like to hold stuff like this and pretend i &apos;m a giant .   
hey !  
how &apos;d the callback go ?  
so what &apos;d you do ?  
well ,  i couldn &apos;t do it .  i told her i didn &apos;t want to get the part that way .  
good for you .  
so .  .  .  and ?  
allright !  
um ,  oh ,  i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  it &apos;s definitely weird not being with ross ,  but i guess i &apos;m doing ok .  actually i &apos;ve got some of his stuff that he ,  um .  .  .  .   
so how did everything go ?  
well ,  we &apos;ve gotta go .  
oh ,  right .  um ,  i &apos;ve got some news .  it &apos;s about us .  
the other us .  
we &apos;re uh ,  we &apos;re getting married .  
anyway ,  we &apos;d like you to come ,  but we totally understand if you don &apos;t want to .  
look i just thought that .  .  .  
is your finger caught in that chair ?  
want us to go ?  
uh - huh .   
this is so cool .  you &apos;re actually gonna be on television .  
it really hit me last night .  i &apos;m gonna be on days of our lives .  and then i started thinkin &apos; about all of u ,  and how these are the days of our lives .  .  
yes !  carol and susan &apos;s caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend ,  and she &apos;s in a full body cast .  
they want me to do it ,  which is really cool ,  seeing as i &apos;ve never catered before ,  and i really need the money ,  and this isn &apos;t a problem for you ,  is it ?  
would it matter ?  
oh ,  you are so great !   thank you !  
are you really not going ?  
i am really not going .  i don &apos;t get it .  they already live together ,  why do they need to get married ?  
they love each other ,  and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them .  
if you wanna call that a reason .  
 who &apos;s the bitterest man in the living room ,  the bitterest man in the living room ?  hi ,  neighbor .  
ross ,  i thought you were over this .  
look ,  that has nothing to do with this ,  ok ?  she &apos;s my ex - wife .  if she were marrying a guy ,  none of you &apos;d expect me to be there .  
hey ,  if she were marrying a guy ,  she &apos;d be like the worst lesbian ever .  
 did i miss it ?  did i miss it ?  
no ,  i &apos;m on right after this guy shoots himself .  
whoa ,  she &apos;s pretty .  
yeah ,  and she &apos;s really nice too .  she taught me all about how to work the cameras ,  and smell - the - fart acting .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  what ?  
what ?  
it &apos;s like ,  you got so many lines to learn so fast ,  that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one .  so while you &apos;re thinkin &apos; of it ,  you take this big pause where you look all intense ,  you know ,  like this .  
oh ,  ok .  
there &apos;s my scene ,  there &apos;s my scene .    &quot; mrs .  wallace ,  i &apos;m dr .  drake ramoray ,  your sister &apos;s neurosurgeon .  
i &apos;m afraid the situation is much worse than we expected .  your sister is suffering from a .  . subcranial hematoma .  perhaps we can discuss this over coffee .  
nice !  
that &apos;s great !  
excellent !  
for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin &apos; to smell something .   
that is so good !  do it again !  
all right ,  all right .   &quot; damnit braverman ,  it &apos;s right there on the chart !  &quot;  
that &apos;s great .  all right ,  i gotta get to work ,  i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect .  
no no ,  that &apos;s me .  
oh ,  yeah .  
oh ,  hello .  
oh ,  thanks .  i couldn &apos;t uh .  .  .  
is everything ok ?  
um ,  no ,  huh - uh .  one of my clients died on the massage table today .  
oh my god .  
that &apos;s a little more relaxed than you want them to get .  
yeah ,  um ,  she was 82 years old .  her name was um ,  mrs .  adelman .  
oh ,  honey .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s just so strange .  i mean ,  she probably woke up today and thought ,   &quot; ok ,  i &apos;ll have some breakfast ,  and then i &apos;ll take a little walk ,  and then i &apos;ll have my massage .  &quot;  little did she know god was thinking ,   &quot; ok ,  but that &apos;s it .  &quot;  oh ,  but the weirdest thing was ,  ok ,  i was cleansing her aura when she died ,  and when the spirit left her body ,  i don &apos;t think it went very far .  
what do you mean ?  
i think it went into me .    
god ,  this is so hard .  i can &apos;t decide between lamb or duck .  
well ,  of course ,  lambs are scarier .  otherwise the movie would &apos;ve been called silence of the ducks .  
ok ,  who ordered what ?  
oh ,  i believe i had the half - drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim .  
yes ,  and this with the cigarette butt in it ,  is that decaf ?  
oh god .  
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re so uptight about your mom comin &apos; .  
i know ,  but it &apos;s just it &apos;s the first time ,  and i just don &apos;t want her to think that because i didn &apos;t marry barry ,  that my life is total crap ,  you know ?  
 talk about crap .  try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time .  
uh ,  pheebs ,  how long do you think this lady &apos;ll be with us ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  she obviously has some kind of unfinished business .   sit up !  
mom !  is it a restaurant ?  who can tell ?  but i guess that &apos;s the fun .  
pretty much .  
this is joey ,  and phoebe ,  and this is chandler ,  and you remember ross .  
hi ,  mrs .  green .   
oh mom !  
believe me ,  sometimes that happens .  father &apos;s house to the sorority house to my husband &apos;s house .  i am just so proud of you .  
really ?  
i know who it is you remind me of .  evelyn dermer .   &apos;course ,  that &apos;s before she got the lousy face lift .  now she looks like soupy sales .  
pheebs ,  who &apos;s evelyn dermer ?  
i don &apos;t know .  who &apos;s soupy sales ?  [at rachel and monica &apos;s 
yeah ,  well just be glad he &apos;s not playing a smaller instrument .  
i know .  and mom ,  i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn &apos;t marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything ,  but this is just so much better for me ,  you know ?  you and i think ,  oh ,  this is what i want .  
for .  .  . me .  
well ,  what do you mean ?  
 all right .  tell me if this is too cute .  lesbian wedding ,  chicken breasts .  
oh god .  i think i &apos;m gonna be sick .  
why ?  it &apos;s not like i &apos;m putting little nipples on them .  
and you had no idea they weren &apos;t getting along ?  
none .  
they didn &apos;t fight a lot ?  
no !  they didn &apos;t even talk to each other .  god ,  how was i supposed to know they were having problems ?  
 in my day ,  divorce was not an option .  
hey ,  look who &apos;s up .  
i just can &apos;t believe this is happening .  i mean ,  when i was little ,  everybody &apos;s parents were getting divorced .  i just figured as a grownup i wouldn &apos;t have to worry about this .  
is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering ?  i mean ,  she &apos;s doing it because she wants to be more like you .  
well ,  then ,  you know ,  couldn &apos;t she have just copied my haircut ?  
you know ,  it &apos;s funny when my parents got divorced ,  they sent me to this shrink ,  and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves .  but in your case it &apos;s actually kinda true .  
that &apos;s him .  
damn .  my mail order grandfather hasn &apos;t come yet .  
yes ,  hi ,  mr .  adelman .  thanks for meeting me .  
um ,  do you wanna sit ?  i do for you ,  my dear ?  
i don &apos;t know how to say this ,  but i think when your wife &apos;s spirit left her body ,  it um ,  kind of stuck around in me .  
yeah .  ok ,  you don &apos;t have to believe me but um ,  can you think of any unfinished business she might have had ,  like any reason she &apos;d be hanging around ?  she always used to say that before she died ,  she wanted to see everything .  
everything ?  
whoa ,  that &apos;s a lot of stuff .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  there &apos;s laughing in my head .   
these are from halloween three years ago .  
no ,  that was his costume .  see ,  he &apos;s actually an orthodontist ,  but he came as a regular dentist .  
um ,  you guys ,  you know when i said before ,   &quot; thank you ,  but i don &apos;t really need your help &quot;  ?  
actually ,  what i think you said was ,   &quot; don &apos;t touch that ,  and get the hell out of my kitchen .  &quot;  
really ?  weird .  anyway ,  see ,  i planned everything really well .  i planned and i planned and i planned .  it just turns out ,  i don &apos;t think i planned enough time to actually do it .  
hey ,  mon ,  you want some help ?  
if you want .  
 hey .  what a day .  i took her everywhere .  the museum of modern art ,  rockefeller center ,  statue of liberty .  
she &apos;s still with you ?  
yeah .  i guess she hasn &apos;t seen everything yet .  i &apos;ll be right back ,  she has to go to the bathroom again .   oh ,  such a pretty face .  anybody have any marijuana ?  
god !  
all right ,  look ,  nobody &apos;s smoking pot around all this food .  
oh !  what &apos;s new in sex ?  
i &apos;m dicing ,  i &apos;m dicing ,  i don &apos;t hear anything .  might be more .  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .  you know what ?  i cannot have this conversation with you .  i mean ,  god ,  you just come in here ,  and drop this bomb on me ,  before you even tell daddy .  what ?  what do you want ?  do you want my blessing ?  
you want me to talk you out of it ?  
then what ?  what do you want ?  
why on earth would i understand this ?  
oh .  
all right people ,  we &apos;re in trouble here .  we &apos;ve only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left .  move ,  move ,  move !  
monica ,  i feel like you should have german subtitles .  
joey ,  speed it up !  
i &apos;m sorry ,  it &apos;s the pigs .  they &apos;re reluctant to get in the blankets !  
monica ,  how did this happen ?  i thought you had this all planned out .  
do you want me to cry ?  is that what you want ?  do you wanna see me cry ?  
sir !  no sir !  
 all right ,  you !  
no .  look ,  i told you i am not a part of this thing .  
all right ,  look ,  ross .  i realize that you have issues with carol and susan ,  and i feel for you ,  i do .  but if you don &apos;t help me cook ,  i &apos;m gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs ,  and i &apos;m gonna create a new appetizer called  &quot; pigs in ross &quot;  .  all right ,  ball the melon .  
hey !  how come i &apos;m stuck dicing ,  when he gets to ball the melon .   
how &apos;s it going ?  
fine ,  whatever .  
nothing .  ok ,  everything .  i think we &apos;re calling off the wedding .  
what ?  
you &apos;re still gonna pay me ,  right ?  or something a little less selfish .  
my parents called this afternoon to say they weren &apos;t coming .  
i mean ,  i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing ,  but they &apos;re my parents .  they &apos;re supposed to give me away and everything .  
and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding ,  and she said we weren &apos;t doing it for them ,  we were doing it for us ,  and if i couldn &apos;t see that ,  then maybe we should call off the wedding .  i don &apos;t know what to do .  
you do ?  
of course i do .  
you &apos;re right .  of course you &apos;re right .  
we &apos;re back on .  
you heard the woman .  peel ,  chop ,  devil !  i can &apos;t believe i lost 2 minutes .   
it just seems so futile ,  you know  ?  all these women ,  and nothing .  i feel like superman without my powers ,  you know ?  i have the cape ,  and yet i cannot fly .  
well now you understand how i feel every single day ,  ok ?  the world is my lesbian wedding .   
thank you .  
you know ,  nothing makes god happier than when two people ,  any two people ,  come together in love .  friends ,  family ,  we &apos;re gathered here today to join carol and susan in holy matrimony .  
 oh my god .  now i &apos;ve seen everything !   whoa ,  she &apos;s gone .  she &apos;s gone .  she &apos;s gone !  go ahead ,  get married .  go ,  go .

i miss rose .  
oh ,  yeah ?  
you know ,  i uh ,  i couldn &apos;t help but overhear what you just said ,  and i think it &apos;s time for you to forget about rose ,  move on with your life .  .  . how  &apos;bout we go get you a drink ?  
ok ,  that &apos;s so nice .   
 i shouldn &apos;t even bother coming up with a line ,  right ?   
hey ,  mom ?  having fun ?  girls made eyes at me over the buffet .  oh ,  i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s something i wanna pursue ,  but it &apos;s nice to know i have options .  
how you doin &apos; ?  
you did a good thing today .  
you wanna dance ?  
come on .  i &apos;ll let you lead .  
ok .   
 all right look .  penis schmenis .  we &apos;re all people .    
ok ,  which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married ?  
well ,  mon ,  i was married .  
yeah ,  me ,  too ,  technically .  
i had a wedding .  
all right ,  just trying to start an interesting discussion .  
i got one .  which one of us do you think will be the last to get married ?   
 .  .  . with monkeyshine beer .   monkeyshine beer ,   &apos;cause it &apos;s a jungle out there . ] 
that commercial always makes me so sad .  
yeah ,  but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him ,  so ,  everything seems to work out ok .  
i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel .  
i can see that ,   &apos;cause they both have those big brown eyes and ,  ya know ,  the little pouty chin .  
and the fact that they &apos;re both monkeys .  
sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing ,  ya know ,  giving him away .  
oh ,  ross ,  you had to ,  i mean ,  he was humping everything in sight .  i mean ,  i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding .  
remember when sometimes he &apos;d borrow your hat ,  and ,  and when you got it back there &apos;d be little monkey raisins in it .  
hey ,  hey ,  check it out ,  guess what i got .  
rhythm ?  
alright !  
  &apos;dear dr .  remore ,  know that i love you and would do anything to have you .  &apos; gosh .   &apos;your not - so - secretive admirer ,  erica ford .  &apos; ooh wait ,   &apos;ps enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes .  &apos; 
ya know ,  in crazy world ,  that means you &apos;re married .  
this wasn &apos;t addressed to days of our lives ,  this is ,  this came to your apartment .  there &apos;s no stamp on it ,  this woman was in our building .  
oh my god ,  i got my very own stalker .   
hey .  
ooh ,  where are you off to ,  travelin &apos; jake ?  
well ,  there &apos;s this ,  uh ,  paleontology conference in l . a .  so i figured i &apos;d go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel .  
you know i think he will be surprised ,   &apos;till he realizes he &apos;s a monkey ,  and uh ,  you know ,  isn &apos;t capable of that emotion .   
oh ,  phoebe ,  that really cute guy is here again .  
oh ,  oh ,  ok ,  so everyone ,  pretend like i &apos;m telling you a story ,  ok .  and ,  and it &apos;s really funny .  so everyone just laugh ,  now .   
hi .  i &apos;m rob dohnen .  
i don &apos;t know anything about music ,  but i think you &apos;re really ,  really great .  
anyway ,  i schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and i was just thinking ,  have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids ?  
hey ,  whaddya wanna do for dinner ?  
well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves .    
it &apos;s erica .  
never mind ,  it &apos;s open .  
 yes ,  hitting her with a frying pan &apos;s a good idea .  we might wanna have a backup plan ,  though ,  just in case she isn &apos;t a cartoon .  
let &apos;s get out of here .   
the one time they &apos;re not home .  
ok ,  we &apos;ll just leave ,  and when we pass her on the stairs ,  she won &apos;t know it &apos;s me  &apos;cause we &apos;ve never met .  
that &apos;s how radio stars escape stalkers .  
it &apos;s me .  
uhh ,  this is it ,  this is how we &apos;re gonna die .  ready ?  
hi .  
hi ,  dean lipson ,  zoo administrator .  i was told you had a question .  
ahh ,  i &apos;m afraid i have some bad news .  marcel has passed on .  
well he got sick ,  and then he got sicker ,  and then he got a little better but then he died .  
i &apos;m sorry mr . _geller .  but ya know ,  there &apos;s an old saying ,   &apos;sometimes monkeys die .  &apos; it &apos;s not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today .  
i &apos;m sorry .  look ,  i know this can &apos;t bring him back but here ,  it &apos;s just a gesture .  
yes ,  and come see the bird show at 4 .  the macaws wear hats .  well it &apos;s a lot cuter if your monkey hasn &apos;t just died .  
ooohhh .  
i know .  
i can &apos;t believe joey &apos;s having lunch with his stalker .  what i -  ,  what is she like .  
well ,  you remember cathy bates in misery ?  
well ,  she looks the exact opposite of that .  
and she &apos;s not crazy ?  
oh no no no ,  she &apos;s a total wack job .  yeah ,  she thinks that joey is actually dr .  drake remore .  
oh my god .  
ah ,  and i mean ,  he &apos;s going out with her ?  he can not persue this .  
you ok ?  
that &apos;s not a good idea ,  that &apos;s kinda the reason the last guy got fired .  
i &apos;m just ,  i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m used to playing for grown - ups .  ya know ,  they just ,  grown - ups drink their coffee and do their grown - up thing ,  ya know ,  and kids listen .  this is a huge responsibility .  what ?  are you gonna kiss me ?  
i was thinkin &apos; about it .  
hi phoebe .

i should just be happy to be near you .  
hey what ?  
 there &apos;ll be times when you get older when you &apos;ll want to sleep with people just to make them like you .   .   .  but don &apos;t .  cause that &apos;s another thing that you don &apos;t wanna do ,  everybody that &apos;s another thing that you don &apos;t wanna do .  
excellent !  
very informative !

that was great ,  the kids loved you .  
and you know why ?  because you told the truth ,  and nobody ever tells kids the truth . you were incredible .  
how did you know there was a but ?  
the thing is ,  i think some of the parents ,  they were kinda hopin &apos; that you &apos;d play more songs about like ,  barnyard animals .  
really ?  
because that would be fantastic .  what ?  you wanna kiss me ?  
ahh ,  the bat .  ambassador of darkness ,  flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger ,  sightless spectre of the macabe .  
oh ,  yeah ,  right .  there was a break - in ,  few months back ,  inside job .  your monkey was taken .  
the zoo !  do you believe everything the zoo tells ya ?  
of course they &apos;re gonna say he &apos;s dead .  they don &apos;t want the bad publicity .  it &apos;s all a great big cover - up .  do you have any idea how high up this thing goes ?  
lipson knows .  do you have any idea who else knows ?  
hmm ,  lipson knows huh ?  ahh ,  hello mr .  opossum ,  enigma of the trees ,  upside - down denizen of the night ,  taunting gravity with .  .  .

then what &apos;s gonna happen ?  
well ,  we won &apos;t wanna raise kids in the city so we &apos;ll probably move to uh ,  scarsdale .  
uh - huh .  
yeah ,  that way i figure ,  ya know ,  we &apos;ll be far enough away from our parents that we don &apos;t have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want .  and yes ,  i know ,  the taxes are a little higher than ,  let &apos;s say ,  nassau county but the school system &apos;s supposedly great .

ok ,  um so ,  i still have to invite dillon and emma and shannon cooper .  
woah ,  woah ,  woah ,  uh ,  no shannon cooper .  
why not her ?  
cause she uh ,  she steals stuff .

joey that is horriable .  
hey i liked her ,  alright .  maybe ,  maybe too much .  i don &apos;t know i guess i just got scared .

 &apos;cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the lender project .  
wha -  wh -  why ,  why ,  why does he suspect that ?  
becasue at first he thought it was joseph .  but after he asked joseph about it ,  turns out it was you .  anyway ,  i just thought you should know .  
alright ,  that &apos;s it .  look joey ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya ,  and if i could just fire joseph ,  i would ,  but unfortunately that &apos;s not possible so i &apos;m gonna have to let both of you go .

honey ,  come on ,  i have to be at work in like ten minutes  oh ,  all right ,  well it &apos;s not like i &apos;m employee of the year or anything .    
there it is .  
oh ,  oh ,  that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about .   hey .  
hey .  
do i look fat ?  
okay ,  i accept that .  when janice asked me and i said no ,  she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow .  
okay ,  walk us through it ,  honey ,  walk us through it .  
okay ,  well .  janice said  &apos;hi ,  do i look fat today ?  &apos; and i ,  i looked at her .  .  .  .  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  you looked at her .  you never look .  you just answer ,  it &apos;s just a reflex .  do i look fat ?  nooo !  is she prettier than i am ?  noo !  does size matter ?  
nooo !  
and it works both ways .  
okay ,  so you both just know this stuff ?  
well you know ,  after about thirty or forty fights ,  you kinda catch on .  
okay ,  for instance .  let &apos;s say ,  janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options .  option number 1 she &apos;ll take a cab home from the airport .  option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim .  which do you do ?  
that &apos;s easy ,  baggage claim .  
 wrong !  now you &apos;re single .  it &apos;s actually secret option number three ,  you meet her at the gate .  that way she knows you love her .  
okay ,  this is good ,  this is good .  all right listen ,  i have one .  janice likes to cuddle ,  at night ,  which ,  you know i &apos;m all for .  but ,  uh ,  you know when you want to go to sleep ,  you want some space .  so ,  uh ,  how do i tell her that without ,  you know ,  accidentally calling her fat or something .  
oh honey ,  i &apos;m sorry we can &apos;t help you there ,   &apos;cause we &apos;re cuddlily sleepers .   okay ,  i &apos;m late for work .

umm ,  not feeling better  &apos;bout malcom .  
ooh !  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  he &apos;s not like a kook ,  no .  he &apos;s just like this ,  this very passionate ,  incredibly romantic guy ,  that got like a tinsy bit carried away ,  you know .  and we just get along really well ,  and he &apos;s so cute .  
oh my god ,  you &apos;ve got a crush on your sister &apos;s stalker .

well ,  aren &apos;t you forgetin &apos; something ?  what ,  what ,  what is uh ,  what is that guy &apos;s name ?  dad !  
it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with ,  if i have to wait another 28 years then ,  i &apos;ll be 56 before i can have a baby ,  and that &apos;s just stupid .  
that ,  that &apos;s what &apos;s stupid .

perhaps ,  you would like me to turn like this ,   so that you can bunny bump against my back .  
 hey !  
hey .  
hey ,  man .  what &apos;s up ?  
maybe you can tell me .  my agent would like to know why i didn &apos;t show up at the audition i didn &apos;t know i had today .  the first good thing she gets me in weeks .  how could you not give me the message ?  !  
well ,  i &apos;ll tell ya i do enjoy guilt ,  but ,  ah ,  it wasn &apos;t me .  
yes ,  it was !  it was him !  uh huh !   okay ,  it was me !  
how is it you ?  
well ,  it was just ,  it was all so crazy ,  you know .  i mean ,  chandler was in the closet ,  counting to 10 ,  and he was up to 7 and i hadn &apos;t found a place to hide yet .  i - i - i meant to tell you ,  and i wrote it all down on my hand .  see ,  all of it .   
yep ,  that &apos;s my audition .  
see ,  now this is why i keep notepads everywhere .  
what is the great tragedy here ?  you go get yourself another appointment .  
well ,  estelle tried ,  you know .  the casting director told her that i missed my chance .  
that is unfair .  i &apos;ll call her and tell her it was totally my fault .  
pheebs ,  you can &apos;t do that .  the casting director doesn &apos;t talk to friends ,  she only talks to agents .  
what a sad little life she must lead .  okay ,  ooh  .  
what ,  what are you doing ?  what are you doing ?  
no ,  no ,  no ,  i know ,  i know ,  ooh .    &apos;hi ,  this is katelynn ,  from phoebe buffay &apos;s office .  um ,  is um ,  ann there for phoebe ,  she &apos;ll know what it &apos;s about .  &apos; 
hang up ,  hang up .   
  &apos;annie !  hi .  listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani ,  apparently he missed his audition .  who did you speak to in my office ?  estelle ,  no ,  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do with her .  no .  all right ,  so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment ,  the world does not stop .  &apos; 
is anybody else scared ?  
  &apos;right ,  well look ,  um ,  if joey loses this audition ,  that is it for estelle .  i don &apos;t care !  annie you are a doll ,  what time can you see him ?  &apos;  i need a pen .   
get the woman a pad !  get the woman a pad !  a pad !  a pad !  
he carries it everywhere ,  it &apos;s like a security blanket ,  but with ski boots and a kicky beret .  
this doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women ,  does it ?  
you know what it &apos;s fine .  if you &apos;re okay with the barbi thing ,  so am i .   
give daddy the barbi !  ben ,  give ,  give me the barbi .  okay ,  how  &apos;bout ,  don &apos;t you want to play with the monster truck ?   no .  okay ,  oh ,  oh ,  how about a dino - soilder ?   
ross ,  you are so pathetic .  why can &apos;t your son just play with his doll ?   
 i gotta go to work .  has anybody seen my left boob ?  
i love that movie .   
there it is .  joey ,  what are you doing ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  it just felt nice .  
 joe .  joe !  answer the phone .  
hey ,  i only got one good arm ,  you know .  you should be doing stuff for me .  go get me a sweater .  
just do it !  okay ,  it &apos;s janice and if i get it i &apos;m going to have to see her tonight .   oh ,  that &apos;s great i &apos;m gonna have to see her tonight .  
what &apos;s the big deal ?  why don &apos;t you wanna see janice ?  
okay ,  last night at dinner ,  when the meals came ,  she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes .  
and that &apos;s bad because .  .  .  ,  you hate chicken piccata ?  
noo .  
you didn &apos;t want to share your tomatoes ,  tomatoes are very important to you .  
no ,  it &apos;s like all of the sudden ,  we were this couple .  and this alarm 
men are unbelievable .  
what is it with you people !  i mean ,  the minute you start to feel something ,  you have to run away ?  
i know ,  that ,   that &apos;s why i don &apos;t want to go tonight ,  i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to say something stupid .  
oh ,  you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you .  
hey ,  you know about that ?  !  
look what do i do ?  i wanna get past this ,  i don &apos;t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing .  i wanna go through the tunnel ,  to the other side !   
 where there is no fear of commitment .  
do we have any .  .  .  do we have any thoughts here ?  
well ,  i &apos;ve never been through the tunnel myself ,   &apos;cause as i understand it ,  you &apos;re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car ,  right .  but ,  it seems to me it &apos;s pretty much like anything else ,  you know ,  face your fear .  it have a fear of heights ,  you go to the top of the building !  if you &apos;re afraid of bugs .  .  .  .  . get a bug .  right .  in this case ,  you have a fear of commitment ,  so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was .  
amazingly ,  that makes sense .  
you think ?  
oh ,  yeah .  go for it man ,  jump off the high dive ,  stare down the barrel of the gun ,  pee into the wind !  
oh ,  it &apos;s your audition from this morning .  can i use the phone again ?  
sure pheebs ,  you know ,  that &apos;s what it &apos;s there for ,  emergencies and pretend agents .  
come on baby ,  come on !  
  &apos;hi ,  i have phoebe buffay returning a page .  okay ,  well ,  um ,  she &apos;s in her car i &apos;ll have to patch you through .  &apos; 
very nice touch .  
  &apos;okay ,  go ahead .  &apos;  um ,  hi annie .   fantastic !   you got it .   oh ,  okay ,  um ,   &apos;will he work for scale ?  &apos; you ask me .  well ,  i don &apos;t know about that ,   except that i do and he will .  great ,  oh you are such a sweetheart .  i would love to have lunch with you ,  how about we have lunch next .  .  .  .  op ,  went through a tunnel .  
unbelievable .  
thank you so much .  
it was really fun ,  i mean i &apos;ve never talked on a car phone before .  
you were amazing ,  could you just do me this huge favor ,  you see there &apos;s this one other audition that i really ,  really want ,  and estelle couldn &apos;t get me in .  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know .  i mean it was fun one time .  
come on ,  please ,  it &apos;ll be just this one more ,  well actually it &apos;s two .  
two ?  
yeah !  well ,  well really it &apos;s three .  please .  you &apos;re so good at it .  i love you .  
okay ,  i &apos;ll do it ,  but just these three ,  right 
so ,  how come you wanted to eat in tonight ?  
ohhh ,  are you a puppy !   contact paper !  i never really know what to say when someone you &apos;re sleeping with gives you contact paper .  
oh ,  you didn &apos;t have to do this .  
well ,  i gotta buy a vowel .  because ,  oh my gawd !  who ,  would &apos;ve thought that someday ,  chandler bing would buy me a drawer .  
we should ?  
 i don &apos;t think we need to ,  because you &apos;re tripping me out right now !  are you okay ?  
you probably want us to move in together ?  
yeah ,  well ,  it scares me !  i mean i not even divorced yet ,  chandler .  you know ,  you just invited me over here for pasta ,  and all of the sudden you &apos;re talking about moving in together .  and ,  and i wasn &apos;t even that hungry .  you know what ,  it &apos;s getting a little late ,  and i - i should just ,  um .  .  .  
honey ,  this will help .   
so ,  i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down .  
that is never good .  
then i got all needy and clingy .  
okay ,  wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  maybe it &apos;s not so bad .  how did you leave it ?  
she said she &apos;d call me .  
oh god .  
welcome to our side of the tunnel .  
this ice cream tastes like crap by the way .  
yeah ,  well that &apos;s that lo - cal ,  non dairy ,  soy milk junk .  we sort of ,  we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases .  
you know ,  when you start get screwed over all the time ,  you gotta switch to low - fat .  
yeah ,  you do .  
so ,  you don &apos;t think i &apos;m terminal ?  
well ,  no ,  not at all ,  you &apos;re not terminal ,  you just ,  you just need some damage control .  
okay ,  okay .  so ,  should i call her ?  
this is a very critical time right now .  if you feel yourself reaching for that phone ,  then you go shoe shopping ,  you get your butt in a bubble bath .  you want her back you have to start acting aloof .  
she has to know that your not ready .  
right .  so ,  what you have to do is ,  you have to accidentally run into her on purpose .  and then act aloof .  
so i &apos;m not ,  not gonna lose her ?  
oooh ,  honey ,  you &apos;re not a total loser .  
i said ,   &apos;so i &apos;m not gonna lose her ?  &apos; 
guess who &apos;s here .  it &apos;s the toughest guy in toy land ,  ben .    &apos;a real american hero .  i &apos;m g . i .  joe !  &apos; drop the barbi ,  drop the barbi .  
g . i .  joe ?  do you really think he &apos;s gonna fall for that ?  
 g .  i .  joe !  cool !  can i play ?  
look ben ,  it &apos;s a toy that protects u . s .  oil interests overseas !  
 helloo !  oh !   
pheebs !  there you are !  
no it &apos;s not ,  sorry .  
but phoebe ,  wait !  wait !  phoebe .  phoebe !   
oh ,  joey !  oh ,  okay ,  see i didn &apos;t recognize you wearing ,  in those .  .  .  . pants .  
look listen ,  that tv movie i went in for ?  did you hear anything ?  i think i got a shot at it .  
yes !  they called and you didn &apos;t get it !  okay ,  i mean you didn &apos;t get it ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  
it &apos;s okay ,  these things happen .  
but they shouldn &apos;t happen ,  you know what ,  you &apos;re ,  you &apos;re in a terrible ,  terrible business .  oh god ,  i don &apos;t wanna be the person who makes your face look like that .  
i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m okay .  see .   
oh ,  now you &apos;re sad and creepy ,  oh .  you know what ,  i ,  i &apos;m sorry i quit ,  okay ,  i just quit .  
no !  no ,  no you can &apos;t quit !  you &apos;re the best agent i ever had !  look pheebs ,  rejection is part being an actor ,  you can &apos;t take it personally .  
not personal ,  really ,  well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent .  
they actually said that ?  
yeah .  ooh god ,  there &apos;s that face again !  see i can &apos;t do this job !  i .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  see that &apos;s why you have to do this job ,  agents always lie .  you know ,  estelle just says stuff like  &apos;they went another way &apos; ,  but this ,  i can use this .   i canna work on a new accent .  
yeah okay ,  no if it helps you okay .  yeah .  
 no ,  thank you .   chandler !  
what are you doing here ?  
are you being british ?  !  
why are you shopping here ?  you don &apos;t live in this neighborhood .  were you here waiting for me ?  
barley ?  what kind of party serves barley ?  
where is this party ?  
who &apos;s party is it ?  
what woman ?  !  
okay ,  you know ,  one of two things is happening here .  either you &apos;re seeing somebody behind my back ,  which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet .  or ,  else you &apos;re pretending that you &apos;re seeing somebody ,  which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle .  so like which of these two guys do you want to be ?   
okay ,  so we got some more good rejections ,  lots of stuff to work on .  
okay ,  shoot .  
okay ,  um ,  oh ,  the zoo commercial .  
i didn &apos;t get it ?  
no .  they said you  &apos;weren &apos;t believable as a human being .  &apos; so ,  you can work on that .  
okay ,  what else ?  
um ,  the off - broadway play people said  &apos;you were pretty but dumb .  &apos; 
oh .  
oh no wait ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  that &apos;s  &apos;pretty dumb .  &apos; 
look ,  it &apos;s okay ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  really ,  look um ,  i really appreciate this pheebs ,  but i think i &apos;m gonna have to go back to estelle .  
oh .  
yeah ,  well don &apos;t get me wrong ,  you &apos;re a better agent than she is ,  but at least with her i don &apos;t want to blow my pretty dumb brains out .  
yeah ,  no ,  i understand .  
you do ,  thanks .  
yeah .  sorry .   
wait a minute .  
what ?  
wait a minute ,  did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent .  
 oh ,  you caught me .  i am so busted .  
 .  .  .  . and then i just ,  you know ,  threw the bag of barley at her ,  and ran out of the store .  
my god !  chandler ,  we said be  &apos;aloof &apos; not  &apos;a doof &apos; .  
i &apos;ve actually ruined this haven &apos;t i ?  it &apos;s time for the good ice cream now ,  right ?

i wish .  no .  after dinner ,  me ,  her ,  and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire .  well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out .  so ,  i picked up a log and threw it on .  or ,  at least what i thought was a log .

waxine !  !  
yes !  have you seen it ?  
oh ,  its incredible !  i so want to be a waxine girl .  
i know !  !  
god .  do think it really doesnt hurt ?  cause how can they do that ?  
hello !  organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest !  
oh my god !  oh my god !  
yeah .  we figured when we couldnt find you ,  youd gone home to make up with rachel .  which is probably what you shoulda done .  huh ?  
you think ?  !  god ,  i ,  ah ,  im in hell .  i mean what ,  what am i gonna do ?  rachels all like ,  i love you and ,  and lets work on this .  and all i can think about is ,  what is she gonna do ?  what is she gonna say ?  when i tell her what i did .  
well ,  before we answer that ,  i think we should address the more important question .  how dumb are you ?  
what ?  !  look ,  were trying to rebuild a relationship here ,  right .  how am i supposed to do that here ,  without being totally honest with each other ?  
look ,  ross look ,  im on board about this totally honesty thing ,  i am ,  just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble .  
hes right .  nobodys gonna benefit ,  and youre just gonna hurt her .  
yeah ,  and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild .  
yeah ,  but dont you think .  .  .  .  
all right look ,  if you absolutely have to tell her ,  at least wait until the timings right .  and thats what deathbeds are for .  
yeah ,  okay .   
all right ,  okay ,  now ,  we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way .   did you think about the trail ?  
what trail ?  
 the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it !   you always have to think about the trail !  
oh ,  i - i dont think theres any trail .  
 after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one ,  
did that !  
grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion .  
okay .   ow !  !  !  !  !  ow - oh - oh !  
was it not pain - free ?  
no .  it was painful .  oh my god  ,  they should call it pain - zine ,  now with a little wax .  
huh ,  well ,  the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad .  
thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid .  but hey ,  y &apos;know if you dont believe me ,  please ,  by my guest .  
 ow - ow - ow - ow !  oh my god !  !  !  
is this about me taking your watch ?  
im sorry ,  i do that .  
oh no .  i feel it isnt really anybodys business ,  y &apos;know .  
oh ,  well i tell issac everything .  
you dog !  
oh right ,  that rachel chick from the coffee place .  
oh ,  hey ,  man i know ,  doesnt matter how much we love em ,  monogamy is too cruel a rule .  
aw ,  no problem dude .  y &apos;know we got to look out for each other .  were the same ,  you and me .  
yeah ,  we are .  
yeah ,  we are .  
okay ,  were not .  
but ,  we are .  
uh - huh .  
you did a bad thing !  
very bad !  
very ,  very bad .  
no .  
all right .  
but you should probably talk to my roommate ,  because i told him and he knows phoebe too .  
ow !  
oh !  !  
ow !  !  ow !  !  
ow !  !  !   
were all right .  
its okay ,  its okay .  
were all right .  
we were just waxing our legs .  
off ?  !  !  
for your information ,  this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience .  
yeah ,  well i dont think you can make that statement ,  unless youve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely .  
yeah ,  i - i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men ,  thats all .  i mean ,  come on ,  its just a little wax .  
oh yeah ,  come here .   
oh ,  thats mature .  
okay ,  fine ,  so now what ,  i just pull it off ?  
uh - huh .  
thats right .    
 come on ,  rachel ,  come on !  talk to me !  please !  !

rachel ?

a mistake ?  !  what were you trying to put it in ?  her purse ?  !   
whe - where did he put it ?  !   
ross ,  you had sex with another woman !   
oh my god .

im sorry ,  okay ,  im sorry .  i wa - i was disgusted with myself ,  and this morning i was so ,  i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy ,  and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible .  
whoa !  !  whoa ,  whoa ,  wait a minute .  what time did your little friend leave ?   oh my god .  she was there ?  she was still there ?  she was in there ,  when i was in there ?  !   
listen .  oh hey ,  hey ,  the important thing was that she meant ,  she meant nothing to me !  
and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship !  !   
look ,  i didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise .  i thought we were broken up .  
we were on a break !  
that ,  for all i knew would ,  could last forever .  that to me is a break - up .  
you think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality ?  
look ,  im not trying to get out of anything ,  okay .  i thought our relationship was dead !  
well ,  you sure had a hell of a time at the wake !   
y &apos;know what ,  i dont think we should listen to this anymore .   
 what ,  what are you doing ?  you cant go out there .

because theyll know weve been listening .

anyway !  her and ross just started yelling at each other .  
wait .  why was he yelling at her ?  hes the one who slept with someone else .

whoa !  !  he is soo unreasonable !  god ,  although i think i understand what he means .  oh my god ,  this is like 60 minutes ,  okay ,  when ,  when ,  at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y &apos;know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow .  
y &apos;know what this is like ?  this is like when my parents got divorced .  man ,  i hope ross doesnt try to kidnap me after cub scouts .

oh right ,  cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play wipe - out on your butt cheeks .

yeah ,  isnt it fantastic ?  
yeah ,  ah ,  but pheebs dont you think hes a little young to get married ?  
what ,  hes 18 .  
exactly ,  itll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party .  
yeah ,  or - or to get a hooker .  
y &apos;know it - its funny ,  um ,  frank told me so much about you ,  but your not how i pictured you at all .

and y &apos;know what ,  i just realised ,  in the last year ive only gone out with two guys ,  richard and julio .  you gotta help me out here ,  you gotta set me up ,  you gotta get me back in the game .  
well ,  that shouldnt be a problem .  i mean i work in fashion and all i meet are eligible straight men .

hmm ,  come on ,  you just said to her that you  .  
well ,  if that were true ,  id dating my aunt ruth .  and the two times we went out were just plain awkward .   come on ,  you think she should go out with me ,  dont you ?  
 well ,  i mean ,  are you sure you want to go out with her ?  i mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning ,  yknow what i mean .  that wig all in disarray ,  and boobs flung over the night stand ,  y &apos;know .  
no ,  i know ,  i know ,  that this is franks life ,   y &apos;know .  y &apos;know ,  i dont want to be all judgmental ,  y &apos;know ,  but this is sick ,  its sick and wrong !  
pheebs ,  what ,  is it the age thing ?  
no - no ,  oh ,  im fine with the age thing y &apos;know ,  until it starts sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat !  
pheebs ,  he seems to enjoy it .  
but ,  i mean ,  do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away ?  !  this is not fair to frank ,   and it - its not fair to the babies ,  and y &apos;know what ,  its not good home economics .  
well ,  have - have you told him how you feel ?  
yes .  not out loud .  
pheebs ,  if you dont tell him ,  soon hes gonna be married ,  and then youre gonna hate yourself .  
yeah ,  but if i do tell him ,  then hes gonna hate myself .  i mean look at him and his mom ,  i cant .   but ,  you guys can ,  please you gotta talk him out of it .  and turns them back to face her . )

okay ,  so what you used to have with rachel ,  is what ive got with alice .

umm ,  alice ah ,  she ah ,  called it off .  
uh ,  no ,  not really ,  just that i was too young ,  y &apos;know ,  but i dont see how i could all of the sudden be too young ,  cause im older than i was when we first got together .

come on ,  that was back in high school !  how could that still bother you ?  
i mean why ,  of all people would you want to go out with chip ?  !  
look ,  you and i went to different high schools .  .  .  
okay ,  that doesnt help me ,  because we went to the same high school .  
you went to one where you were popular ,  and you got to ride off chips motorcycle ,  and wear his letterman jacket .  i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made .  
 they had to have that specially made ?  !  
it was a project for one of the home ec classes .  
 oh my god ,  they told us that was for the mascot !  
back then ,  i thought that i would never ,  ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews ,  and now hes - hes called me up and asked me out .  and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go .  i - i owe her this .  i never let her eat .  
oh ,  you go out with him .   
oh ,  really ?  !  
yeah .  just ,  if its possible ,  could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy ?  
so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center ?  
well ,  there were a couple of calls last night ,  but ah ,  i dont think any of them are gonna work out .  
yes ,  joey has a very careful screening process .  apparently ,  not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails .  
 stop it !  stop it !  she keeps squirming ,  trying to get away !  just like when she was alive .  
so pheebs ,  how long is your mom gonna be with us ?  
well ,  im not sure .  i mean ,  i guess until she y &apos;know ,  gets used to the fact that theres y &apos;know ,  a new mom .  y &apos;know ,  i think shes worried that y &apos;know ,  shes gonna ,  shes gonna be replaced .   well ,  thats not gonna happen is it ?  noo .   okay ,  i have to return a call in the other room .  
why cant you use the phone in here ?  
well ,  im returning a call from a certain mom at the b - e - a - c - h .  i just spelled the wrong word .   
so ,  guys ,  am i crazy ,  or does phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat ?

where did you ,  when did you ,  how did you .  .  .   how did you get a girl like that ?  
yeah ,  so what is she ,  like a .  .  .  like a spokesmodel ,  or an aerobics instructor ,  what ?  
actually she &apos;s a paleontology doctoral candidate ,  specializing in the centazoic era .  
okay ,  but that &apos;s ,  like ,  the easiest era .  
i &apos;ve seen her at work ,  but i always figured ,  ah - huh ?  but ,  uh ,  i made her dinner .  we had a great time .  and we &apos;re going out again tomorrow .

oh ,  the velveteen rabbit !  oh my god ,  when the boy &apos;s love makes the rabbit real !  
okay ,  but don &apos;t touch it ,  because you fingers have destructive oils .  
huh .  well ,  then you &apos;d better keep it away from ross &apos;s hair .  so this is pretty rare .  how did you get that ?  
oh ,  it wasn &apos;t a big deal .  i just went to a couple of bookstores ,  talked to a couple of dealers .  .  .  called a couple of the author &apos;s grandchildren .  
oh ,  honey ,  that &apos;s so sweet .  
yeah ,  and what a great way to say ,   &quot; i secretly love you ,  roommate &apos;s girlfriend !  &quot;

how do you think it &apos;s gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange ?  
okay ,  all right ,  i &apos;ll just uh ,  make sure that uh ,  joey gets her something really great .  
it &apos;s gotta be better than that book .  oo !  like a crossbow !

oh my god !  what happened ?  
sixty guests .  
so ,  uh ,  why did you have to turn it down ?  
because i don &apos;t have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice .  i mean there &apos;s no way .  
wow ,  what is with all the negativity ?  you sound like monican &apos;t  ,  not monican .  .  .    .  .  . monica .  look ,  you know ,  you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years .  do you want to be a caterer or not ?

because she &apos;s not eleven !  and it &apos;s not the seventh night of hanukkah !  
okay ,  honey ,  what he means by that ,  is  .  .  . while this is a very nice gift ,  maybe it &apos;s just not something a boyfriend gives ?  
sure it is !  she needs a pen for work ,  she &apos;s writing ,  she turns it over .  .  .  .   &quot; whoa !  it &apos;s time for my date with joey !  &quot;  
all right ,  look ,  look .  what did .  .  .  what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday ?

i know ,  it &apos;s tough .  you know what the first thing i did after my mother &apos;s funeral was ?  
what ?  
pay the caterer !  look ,  i &apos;ve had a lot of jobs ,  okay ,  and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying .  it &apos;s either ,  you know ,   &quot; that massage wasn &apos;t long enough ,  or ,   &quot; i don &apos;t recognize any of those songs ,  &quot;  or ,  you know ,   &quot; these sombreros aren &apos;t big enough .  bad little white girl !  &quot;  
okay .  so what do you .  .  .  .  you think she &apos;s faking ?  
well ,  it seems like there weren &apos;t any tears  &apos;til you showed her the bill .  
phoebe ,  she sounded pretty upset to me .   forever in peace may you wave .  .  .  .  
so ,  you just left ?  her place was really that bad ?  
you know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day ?  
yeah .  
well ,  like that ,  only instead of a chair ,  it &apos;s a pile of garbage .  and instead of a jacket ,  it &apos;s a pile of garbage .  and instead of the end of the day ,  it &apos;s the end of time ,  and garbage is all that has survived !   here .  
wow .  thanks .  so ,  uh ,  what happened ?  
what do you mean ?  nothing happened !  i had to get out of there .  
all right ,  so .  .  .  next time ,  you take her to your place .

any luck ?  
oh ,  yeah .  yeah ,  i found this great place called  &quot; invisible things for kathy .  &quot;   can you give me a hand with all this stuff ?  
all right ,  look .  why don &apos;t you just return the book ,  let joey give her the clock pen ,  and you give her something worse than that .  like .  .  .  a regular pen .  
she &apos;s really going to love this ,  you know ?  the bottom line is i want her to have it ,  even if i don &apos;t get to be the one who gives it to her .  
aw ,  honey ,  that &apos;s so sweet .  
yeah ?  you don &apos;t think it &apos;s just pathetic ?

okay ,  widow !  
excuse me .  excuse me !   thanks .  um ,  clearly this is a very ,  very hard time for you .  um ,  but ,  um ,  we provided a service ,  and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service ,  and ,  um ,  we are not leaving here until we &apos;re paid every penny .   &apos;cause you know what ,  lady ?  we &apos;re part time caterers ,  and we have no place else to go .

y &apos;know if we ever go to war and youre captured ,  youre in for a big surprise .  
it just keeps getting worse and worse !  y &apos;know ?  i mean its bad enough that im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way ,  i think she knows .  because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us .  and call me crazy ,  but i think she likes me too .  and now i have seen her naked .  i mean at least when ive seen her with clothes on ,  i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something .  but there are no boles ,  shes smooth !  smooth !

you obviously havent screwed over a lot of your friends .   which we all appreciate .  
no the - the sad thing is ,  if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her ,  knowing joey ,  he probably just wouldve just stepped aside .  
oh ,  dont say that !  dont say that .  thats not true .  is it ?  
i think maybe ,  yeah .  
he loves you .  
then why didnt you tell me to do that ?  !  !  
well ,  i said - i said something to phoebe .

yeah ?  
yeah .  you know why ?  cause you came to me first .  
well ,  i thought that would be the best thing to do .  
but hey ,  listen just so you know ,  you might have youre work cut out for you .  cause when i talked to her ,  i kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy .  so 
see uh ,  thats - thats actually what i wanted to talk to you about .  i - i think i know who the other guy is .  
who ?  
its me .  im the other guy .

and what ?  !  did you sleep with her ?  !  
no !  no !  no !  i just kissed her .  
what ?  !  !  thats even worse !  !  
how is that worse ?  !  
i dont know !  but its the same !  
look ,  im sorry !  but theres nothing i can do ,  i think im in love with her !  
who cares ?  !  you went behind my back !  i would never do that to you !  
youre right ,  i have no excuses !  i was totally over the line .  
over the line ?  !  you - youre - youre so far past the line ,  that you - you cant even see the line !  the line is a dot to you !  
yes .  yes !  right !  and i feel horrible .  you have to believe me !  
is that why you bought all this stuff ?  !   well ,  yknow what i will not watch your tv ,  i will not listen to your stereo ,  and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that im not gonna eat !  you know why ?  !  
probably because 
oh my god ,  hes lost it .  hes totally lost it .

phoebe ,  his music could not get any worse .  there are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves .   
thank you ,  thanks .   yeah ,  i lost it .  yknow ,  im not gonna play anymore ,   would you ,  can you finish my set ?

 aww ,  turkey !  aww ,  giving thanks !  aww !  
look everyone ,  its the spirit of thanksgiving !  
so are things with you and joey any better ?  
they couldnt be worse .  i spent eight hours calling him last night ,  just trying to get him to talk to me .  
oh wow ,  eight hours ?  so you could probably really use one of those plug - in telephone headsets huh ?  
should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office ?  
you shouldnt .  
speaking of christmas ,  umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money ,  umm ,  this year maybe we could do secret santa ,  and then we each only buy one gift .  and - and theres the added mystery of who gets who .  
who gets whom .   i dont know why i do that .   
well ,  im gonna take a nap ,  turkey makes me sleepy .  
we havent eaten yet !  
i know ,  but all that work youre doing to get it ready ,  i just  
hey ,  by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa ,  cause i wanna trade for her .  
i picked her !  oh thank god you want her !  ooh !  
wow !  why do you want to get rid of her so badly ?  
because she exchanges every gift she ever gets ,  its like impossible to get her something she likes .  come on ,  lets trade !  
oh thats not true !  thats not true !  i got her that backpack and she loved it !  i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  oh ,  there was no big dog .  all right this sucks !  i already got her this briefcase ,  and i had r . g .  put on it  her initials 
ohh .  
well ,  maybe you could give to somebody else .  ooh ,  like ross geller .  
op ,  y &apos;know what though ,  its kindve a girlie briefcase .  
who cares ?  he works in a museum !  
hey ,  what time is it ?  the big game is about to start !  
you dont have to do that ,  ross and joey arent here ,  you can watch the parade if you want .  
thanks .  
what is wrong with this freezer ?  !   ow !  ow !  !  
god ,  what happened ?  !  
oh my god ,  ice just got in my eye !  
 people are trying to sleep in here !  
monica got ice in her eye ,  and it hurts .  
open it up ,  let me see .  
oh ,  yknow what ,  i cant ,  it really kills .  
well maybe you should put some ice on it .  
ooh ,  god it looks bad .  
honey ,  maybe we should take you to a doctor .  
no ,  my eye doctor is richard !  i cant go to him when i dont have a boyfriend !  
hes really picky about his patients .  
honey ,  youve got to go .  whats his office number ?  
like i remember his office number !   speed dial 7 .  
 hi !  yeah ,  im calling on behalf of monica gellers eye ,  and is um ,  is richard burke in today .   hes out of town ,  but does she want to see the on - call doctor ?  
yes !  !  
yes !  shes very excited about that .   
this is so cool ,  til monica gets back ,  its like im head chef and i get to make all the decisions .   
hey - hey ,  i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly !  
okay ,  get out of my kitchen !  
 all right !  okay !  i think i am making some progress with joey ,  when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once !   i mean yeah ,  he gave me the finger while doing it .  
all right i i gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question .  
so listen ah ,  i picked monica for secret santa ,  but im already getting her something for chanukah ,  i was wondering if you wanna switch .  
oh yknow what ,  i was already trying to trade for ah ,  well ,  you .  
really ?  !  wow !  thats - thats so nice ,  what are you gonna get me ?  
i dont know r . g .  ,  i was thinking something girlie for your office .  
yeah ,  well maybe phoebe will switch with me .  
oh no - no - no ,  you dont want to do that ,  then youre gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets .  
oh ,  thats not true !  ive got her lots of stuff she never took back .  
like ?  
like uh ,  that gold necklace i got her last year .  
when was the last time you saw her wear it ?  
well ,  she wore it all christmas day ,  and then uh 
 hey !  
hey !  
what are you doing ?  
im sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt .  
everything ?  even the tv ?  
no !  im putting that in my room .  
listen ,  joey ,  i know what he did was wrong but dont you think you could at least hear the guy out ?  
back when you and rachel were together ,  if chandler had kissed her ,  would you hear him out ?  
thats a good point .  so uh ,  how long are you gonna punish him ?  
five years .  
youve sentenced him ?  !  
hey !  dont do the crime if you cant do the time .  
joey ,  the guys your best friend .  
no ,  was my best friend .  anyway ,  i dont know why youre pushing for him so hard .  with him out of the way as my best friend ,  theres a spot open .  
oh ,  who ?  me ?  
yeah !  
wow !  im honored !  and yknow what im gonna do as my first act as your best friend ?  
what ?  
im gonna get you to talk to chandler .  
oh my god ,  is it really that bad ?  
i walk into a room and he wont even talk to me ,  he just mumbles something in italian .  and i know he only knows the bad words .  
oh .  
hey joe .  
ill be right with you .  okay ?   thanks ,  wendy .  
oh my god !  how cute is the on - call doctor ?  
dr .  burke will see you know .  
hey !  im sorry !  that where are you going ?  
my folks .  
oh ,  uh ,  when - when are you coming back ?  
i dont know .  i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment .  
what ?  !  
yeah ,  yknow at first i thought we could talk about this yknow ,  work it out ,  but uh ,  seeing you two together i dont think i 
hey ,  look ,  what do you want me to say ?  do you want me to say that ill stop seeing her ?  
look ,  its not about her .  okay ?  but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did .  and i dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend .  so ,  ill see ya .   
hey ,  look ,  i know what it is to be a friend ,  i just - i just screwed up !  
yeah !  you did !  and thats why im leaving .   
all right look ,  if youre not gonna stay for me ,  then at least stay for them !  okay ,  they have had a very difficult year !  what with the robbery and all !  
when that guy was robbing us ,  and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours ,  you know what i was doing in there all that time ?  i was thinking about how i let you down !  
what ?  
yeah !  but if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be ,  i wouldnt have worried about it so much !  see you around !  
all right ,  wait !  come on !  just wait one second !  there has to be something that i can do !  something !  if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down .   what ?  
last time i saw you ,  it was the morning i left for college .  and you were just standing outside the dairy queen .  
i gotta tell you ,  you look great now .  
youre an excellent patient !  
well ,  youve got a little scratch on your cornea ,  your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days .  
if that helps you .  
i moved back here a couple of months ago .  
uh .   
i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriends .  
but we broke up .  
she - she wasnt ready for a serious commitment .  
youre not wearing the patch yet .  
hes coming here for thanksgiving !  
i know ,  its sick .  
why is it sick ?  
because its richards son !  its like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner !  
hey ,  come on ,  phoebe ,  you understand dont you ?  
yeah ,  i can see where id be your best shot but ,  no .  im sorry ,  but i think its twisted .  
yeah .  
 whats twisted ?  
me going out with richards son .  
ewwwww !  !  ew !  ew !  ew !  
 sounds like a really bad idea to me .  
is he okay in there ?  
hes fine !  
hey ,  y &apos;know ,  mon ,  if things wrong out between you and richards son ,  youd be able to tell your kids ,  that you slept with their grandfather .  
fine !  judge all you want to but ,   married a lesbian ,   left a man at the altar ,   fell in love with a gay ice dancer ,   threw a girls wooden leg in a fire ,   livin in a box !  !   
so now ,  what exactly is the point of the box ?  
chandler ?  
the meaning of the box is three fold .  one  ,  it gives me the time to think about what i did .  two  ,  it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey .  and three  ,  it hurts !  
 oh hey !  hey uh ,  you remember the necklace i gave you last year ?  can i see it ?  
 why ?  
i just wanna check something .  
okay .   
 now ,  well see .  
air hole !  air hole !  !   
 here it is !  i love it .  i wear it all the time .  
 the necklace i got you was gold ,  this one is silver .  
huh ,  well maybe it uh ,  it changed .  
oh my god !  you actually exchanged it !  
well isnt it better that i exchanged it for something that i enjoy and that i can get a lot of use out of ?  
what did you get ?  
credit .

ross ,  can you pass me the yams ?

theres nothing the matter with me .  see ,  im not completely devoid of sentiment ,  see i have feelings .  
okay ,  fine .    
you cant tell ,  but im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys !  
all right ,  look !  if this is just a big joke to you ,  then forget about it ,  all right ?  !  this means something to me !  and if it doesnt mean anything to you ,  then you should get out of there ,  otherwise youre just an idiot in a box !  
youre right ,  and im sorry !  this means a lot to me !  i want you to be my friend again !  i swear ,  i wont say another word tonight .  
so are you gonna start taking this thing seriously ?  
absolutely !  
that sounds like another word to me !  are you gonna take this seriously ?   okay .   
dont say that i have no sentiment !   this is a movie stub from our first date !  this is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed !   this is from the museum from the first time we were together .  okay ,  maybe i exchange gifts sometimes ,  but i keep the things that matter !  
i dont know what to say ,  im sorry .  though ,  youre not supposed to take these .   its like a million years old ,  we ,  we actually ,  we had people looking for that .

y &apos;know you guys were a lot more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture .  
yeah .  
we just want you to think it through .  
yeah ,  honey ,  maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby .  like your mom ?  
umm ,   i love this touchy .  can i take it to work with me ?  
oh !   
i am so jealous .  
you guys are really right there arent you ?  
yes .  right where ?  
in the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex and talking and 
yeah ,  you - you gotta love the talking .  
and the sex ?  
all right ,  we havent had sex yet .  okay ,  whats the big deal ?  yknow ?  this is special ,  and i want our love to grow until we move on to the next level .  
oh ,  chandler that is so nice .  
that is really nice lying !  no way is that the reason !  
why ?  just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that ?  !  
no ,  hes right ,  im totally lying .   
then what is it ?  
well ,  kathys last boyfriend was joey .  
and youre afraid you wont be able to fill his shoes .  
no ,  im afraid i wont be able to make love as well as him .  
yeah ,  i was going for the metaphor .  
yes ,  and i was saying the actual words .  
so big deal ,  so joeys had a lot of girlfriends ,  it doesnt mean hes great in bed .  
we share a wall !  so either hes great in bed ,  or she just likes to agree with him a lot .  
sweetie ,  with you its gonna be different .  the sex is gonna be great ,  cause you - you guys are in love .  
yeah ?

okay .  i only wish i had someone there that had given up babies ,  that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies .  i just think that ,  it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life .  so ,  how ever hard it is to give up this puppy ,  it would be like a million times harder to give up a child .   i really shouldnt have given you the puppy first .

people can hear you .  
i know !  !   
wow !  she looks great .  doesnt she ?  
hi !  
that is one good looking man !  
no ,  youre my first .  put the money on the table .   harder . ) 
if you want it to be .   
oh ,  hey ,  mon ,  do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school ?  
yeah ,  i think i have some around here somewhere .  why ?  
well ,  its just that maternity clothes are so expensive .   
hey ,  rach !  i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room .  if you could just  throw your purses at it .  
bloomingdales eliminated my department .   
oh my god ,  are you out of a job ?  
no ,  but they stuck me in personal shopping .  which is just a huge step down !  
personal shopping ?  what is that ?  like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy ?  
uh - huh .  
that sounds great !  
 hey !   
umm ,  excuse me ,  we switched apartments .  you cant eat are food anymore ,  that - that gravy train had ended .  
 theres gravy ?  
if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time .  that fridge has got to be stocked ,  okay ,  thats your department now .    
what are you doing ?  
hey !  
hey !  
hey !  
ooh !  how was kathys play ?  
well ,  kathy gets half - naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy .  
yeah ,  its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it !  
thats a good idea for a business !  
im totally screwed .  okay ,  they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night ,  and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me .  y &apos;know itll be like ,   &quot; so wheres your boyfriend ,  whats - his - name ,  chester ?  &quot;  and shell go ,   &quot; no - no - no ,  its chandler .  &quot;  and hell go ,   &quot; whatever .  ha - ha - ha - ha !  &quot;  
 that - that is a good trick .  
all right ,  look ,  look ,  what am i gonna do ?  
chandler ,  look theyre actors .  theyre there to do a job ,  just cause they work together ,  doesnt mean theyre gonna get together .  i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins ,  it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them .  
oh - oh ,  alec baldwin and kim basinger .  
tom cruise and nicole kidman .  
yeah .  
hey ,  mel gibson and clint eastwood .  
theyre not a couple !  
oh - okay ,  i get the game now .  
okay look ,  look ,  let me ask you a question ,  when they were doing it on stage ,  was it like really hot ?  
oh yeah !  
well okay ,  so then youre fine .  the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off - stage all the sexual tension between them is gone .  okay ?  so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about .  its when the heat goes away ,  thats when youre in trouble .  
really ?  
look ,  you guys have been to every play ive ever been in ,  have i ever had chemistry on stage ?  
no .  
so uh ,  man ,  are you gonna go to the play with me tonight ?  
yknow what ,  i dont know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend .

it is not over !  youre over !  
what ?  
you know !  
okay .   good one .  
it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you .  and the reason why she couldnt ,  is because her feelings were so strong ,  it scared her .  now you go home and wait for her call ,  she could be calling you from the plane !  come on now go !  go !   
okay !  okay !  but if she doesnt call ,  it is definitely over !  no ,  wait .  wait .  unless ,  eventually ,  i call her ,  yknow just to she whats going on ,  and ,  and she says shell call me back ,  but then she doesnt .  then its over .

whats the second part of your plan ?  
ross .  
it was dreadful .  i felt terrible about how i acted when you said those wonderful things .  
ross umm ,  theres something that ive got to tell you ,  theres - theres someone else .  
she doesnt know which one of us she wants ,  me or this colin guy .  
this isnt how its supposed to go ,  there cant be another guy .  
well 
of course theres another guy !  !  this is even more perfect !  now you have to prove your love !  
im not proving anything .  okay ,  im done listening to you .  if i hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place ,  i never wouldve put my fist through the wall !  
you put your fist through the wall ?  
no ,  i missed and hit the door .  but ,  it opened really hard !  
you have to go to london !  
what ?  
yeah ,  you have to go fight for her !  
oh yeah ,  sure ,  that makes sense .  yeah .  cause you already told her you love her and she didnt say it back ,  then she called you and told you that theres another guy ,  so yeah ,  go to london thatll scare her !

thats sounds great ,  but how are you going to afford it ?  
well ,  we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised 
im telling it !  im telling it !  
okay .

a place where no one will ever get out alive ?  
no !  think about it ,  its a taxi that people take when they need to relax ,  its

 im - im sorry ,  i just thought that

 hey guys !

i just wanted to thank you again for last night ,  what a great party !  and the guys from work had a blast .  yknow ,  one of them had never been to a bachelor party before .  yeah !  and - and another one had never been to a party before ,  so 
so uh ,  hey ,  that uh ,  that wedding ring ,  huh ?  man ,  thats nice !  
yeah ,  right !  
i was uh ,  i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself ,  i might want to get one of those 
that ring ?  when my grandmother first came to this country ,  that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her .  
so you might say ,  the ring is irreplaceable ?   
oh absolutely !  it has been in my family for generations ,  and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life .  
so you might say ,  its a magic ring .  
 yeah ,  the stripper stole it .  
my - my ring ?  my - my wedding ring ?  the - the stripper stole my wedding ring ?  !  h - how ?  !  how could this all happen ?  !  
well ,  i think it all started when you said ,   &quot; hey joey ,  why dont you be my best man .  &quot;  
 all right - all right ,  fine !  i - im gonna call the cops !  
dude ,  i screwed up ,  you dont have to turn me in !  
not on you !  on the stripper !  
oh ,  yeah ,  well i already did that !  they said theyre gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders .  
okay ,  well ,  well call the company that sent her !  
i did that too !  they wouldnt give me her real name or her number .  they said ,   &quot; if i bothered them again theyd call the police .  &quot;  i said ,   &quot; if you talk to the police ,  you tell them im missing a ring !  &quot;  
so what ,  joey ?  wh - wh - what ?  what are you telling me ?  that theres nothing we can do ?  well ,  how could this happen ?  !

thanks .  
hello ?  
we dont have to .  
no .  but ,  monica and i were talking ,  and - and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down ,  and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit .  
she said ,   &quot; if im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day ,  well then we should just postpone it .  &quot;  
i realize that people are going to be disappointed .  but ,  im sure theyll come back when we can do it right .  
dont you point your pants at me !   we have no choice !  anywhere thats half - decent wouldve be booked months ago ,  ross dont you understand ?  this is our wedding im talking about .  
so what are you saying ?  its now or never ?  
or ?  
its not the pants .  its you that is backwards .  and if ,  and if you dont understand how important this is to me ,  well then ,  perhaps we shouldnt get married at all !   
hey !  
 hi .  
so ,  did shopping make you feel any better about ross ?  
manhattan does not have enough stores .  
well ,  i think i can help you get over him .  
you can ?  
yeah .  i just need you to bring me some photos of ross .  
um - hmm .  
and a small piece of chocolate .  
okay .  
and a glass of tepid water .   
ooh ,  is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north - facing tree ?  
uh ,  only if you have the hiccups too .  yeah ,  the pictures are for you ,  the water and the chocolate is for me .  i just didnt feel like getting up .  okay ,  im gonna show you a picture of ross .  okay ?  and youre going to remember all of the bad things about him .  all right ?  really focus on his flaws .  
i can do that .  i certainly did it when we were going out .  
okay .  umm ,  before we get started ,  i just wanna say for the record that i love ross ,  i think hes such a great guy .  here .   okay ,  now ,  close your eyes .  and imagine that youre with ross okay and imagine that youre kissing him .  and youre - youre running your hands all over his body .  and then you run your hands through his hair ,  but eew - oh gross its some kind of grease ,  itsuck !  hah ?  
i dont know ,  his uh ,  his hair never really bothered me that much ,  and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy .  
okay ,  this is going to be harder than i thought .  umm ,  lets try some uh ,  aversion therapy .  
okay .  
okay ?  
all right .  
so uh ,  now look at the picture

why ?  !  
i dont know ,  i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out .  
oh my god .  youre even dumber than i am !  
excuse me ?  
ross ,  how long have you been planning this wedding ?  
i dont know .  a month ?  
emily has probably been planning it since she was five !  ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head .  thats what we did !  we dreamed about the perfect wedding ,  and the perfect place ,  with the perfect four - tiered wedding cake  ,  with the little people on top .   thanks .  but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was .  
i had no idea .  and that - that pillowcase thing ,  i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun .  
sometimes we were .  
come on .  you gotta help me figure out what to do .  okay ?  
okay .  
come on .   
that was pretty intense huh ?  
yeah .   hey ,  i hope ross didnt think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here !  
hello .  
 hey ,  pheebs !  its joey !  
hey ,  joey !  hey !  ooh !  ooh !  i just say someone on thethat looks just like you on the subway .  and i was gonna go over and say hi !  but then i figured ,  he doesnt care if he looks like you .

irachel ,  you cant go !  ross loves emily !  
yeah ,  i know ,  i know ,  i know he does .  but i have to tell him how i feel !  he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision .

chicken kiev ?

yeah ,  y &apos;know ,  but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken .  and ,  you wouldn &apos;t have to worry about the salmonella .   but of course with salmon you &apos;d have to worry about the chickenella .  .  .  so ,  i can &apos;t wait to see this place you &apos;re getting married !

oh ,  i don &apos;t know .  i guess we have to eat .  
yeah ,  i do .  what &apos;s the matter ?  
i &apos;m just bummed about the way i left things with ross .  i shouldn &apos;t have lied to him about having to work .  he seemed so mad at me .  
eh ,  don &apos;t be so hard on yourself .  if someone i was still in love with was getting married .  .  .  
 still in love with ?  !  
yeah !  
i &apos;m not in love with ross !  
oh .  no .  no .  good !  yeah ,  me neither .  
phoebe ,  i &apos;m going to ross &apos;s wedding because he is my ex - boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable .  not because ,  i &apos;m still in love with him !  i mean ,  hey ,  y &apos;know ,  i like ross as much as the next guy ,  y &apos;know ?  clearly i have feelings for him ,  but feelings don &apos;t mean love !  i mean ,  i still have loving feelings for ross .  yeah !  but ,  i have ,  i have continuing feelings of love ,  but that doesn &apos;t mean that - that i &apos;m still in love with him .  y &apos;know ?  i - i have sexual feelings for him ,  but i do love him - ohh !  oh my god !  oh my - why didn &apos;t you tell me ?  !  !  
we thought you knew !  
we ?  !  
yeah ,  we all know !  we talk about it all the time !  
you all know ?  does ross know ?  
oh no ,  ross doesn &apos;t know anything .  
oh ,  i can not believe you didn &apos;t tell me !  
well ,  because we thought you knew !  !  it &apos;s so obvious !  god ,  that would be like telling monica ,   &quot; hey ,  you like things clean .  &quot;  or ,  y &apos;know ,   &quot; hey ,  joey ,  you &apos;re gay .  &quot;   
what ?  !  
hey !  post cards .  .  .  
check this out ?  huh ?   yeah .  that &apos;s the stuff .  what do you think ?  
well ,  i don &apos;t have to buy that ,   &quot; i &apos;m with stupid &quot;  t - shirt anymore .  
well ,  i like it .  here you go .   
all right ,  look ,  you &apos;re not really gonna buy that are you ?  don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve embarrassed me enough for one day ?  
oh ,  i embarrass you ?  
how can i answer that when i &apos;m pretending i don &apos;t know you ?  
oh really ?  then how come no one here is wearing them ?  
all right ,  look ,  if you insist on wearing that ,  in public ,  y &apos;know ,  you &apos;re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself .  
oh yeah ?   if you &apos;re gonna make me choose between you and the hat ?  i choose the hat .  
thanks .  
okay ,  wait .  all right ,  that &apos;s it ,  okay ,  i &apos;m out of here .  i am not going to be embarrassed anymore !    
hello ?  
we don &apos;t have to .  
no .  but ,  monica and i were talking ,  and - and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down ,  and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit .  
she said ,   &quot; if i &apos;m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day ,  well then we should just postpone it .  &quot;  
i realise that people are going to be disappointed .  but ,  i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll come back when we can do it right .  
don &apos;t you point your pants at me !   we have no choice !  anywhere that &apos;s half - decent would &apos;ve be booked months ago ,  ross don &apos;t you understand ?  this is our wedding i &apos;m talking about .  
so what are you saying ?  it &apos;s now or never ?  
or ?  
it &apos;s not the pants .  it &apos;s you that is backwards .  and if ,  and if you don &apos;t understand how important this is to me ,  well then ,  perhaps we shouldn &apos;t get married at all !   
hey !  
 hi .  
so ,  did shopping make you feel any better about ross ?  
manhattan does not have enough stores .  
well ,  i think i can help you get over him .  
you can ?  
yeah .  i just need you to bring me some photos of ross .  
um - hmm .  
and a small piece of chocolate .  
okay .  
and a glass of tepid water .   
ooh ,  is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north - facing tree ?  
uh ,  only if you have the hiccups too .  yeah ,  the pictures are for you ,  the water and the chocolate is for me .  i just didn &apos;t feel like getting up .  okay ,  i &apos;m gonna show you a picture of ross .  okay ?  and you &apos;re going to remember all of the bad things about him .  all right ?  really focus on his flaws .  
i can do that .  i certainly did it when we were going out .  
okay .  umm ,  before we get started ,  i just wanna say for the record that i love ross ,  i think he &apos;s such a great guy .  here .   okay ,  now ,  close your eyes .  and imagine that you &apos;re with ross okay and imagine that you &apos;re kissing him .  and you &apos;re - you &apos;re running your hands all over his body .  and then you run your hands through his hair ,  but eew - oh gross it &apos;s some kind of grease ,  it &apos;s - uck !  hah ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  his uh ,  his hair never really bothered me that much ,  and y &apos;know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy .  
okay ,  this is going to be harder than i thought .  umm ,  let &apos;s try some uh ,  aversion therapy .  
okay .  
okay ?  
all right .  
so uh ,  now look at the picture .  .  .  
okay .  
all right ,  and umm .  .  .   
ow !  
okay ,  how do you feel now ?  
well ,  this is just as boring in england .   
hey .  
hey .   
oh .   sorry !  
no - no - no ,  y &apos;know what ?  i really shouldn &apos;t have said that you were embarrassing me ,  i mean that really wasn &apos;t cool .  and if it makes you feel any better ,  i &apos;ve had a really lousy day .  
me too .  
yeah ?  
noo !  !  i &apos;ve had the best day ever !  dude ,  check this out !  now ,  i &apos;m gonna fastforward past the part with you ,   &apos;cause it is boring .  
 hey !  
sh - shh - shh !    
 okay ,  so umm ,  what &apos;s your friend &apos;s name ?  
hi chandler !   
that &apos;s .  .  .  that &apos;s was .  .  .  
oh my god !

yeah ,  ummm ,  i don &apos;t like the hat that much .   
how did you ?  how ?  how ?  
well ,  i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace ,  right ?  so ,  i &apos;m in my map and - and .  .  .  hey !  
hey !

umm .  .  .  
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .  
wait up !   
hey - hey ,  since you &apos;re the  &apos;fix - it &apos; lady ,  here &apos;s a pickle ,  what do you do when the bride says she doesn &apos;t want to have the wedding at all ?  
she said that ?  !  
yeah .  
why ?  !  
i don &apos;t know ,  i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out .  
oh my god .  you &apos;re even dumber than i am !  
excuse me ?  
ross ,  how long have you been planning this wedding ?  
i don &apos;t know .  a month ?  
emily has probably been planning it since she was five !  ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head .  that &apos;s what we did !  we dreamed about the perfect wedding ,  and the perfect place ,  with the perfect four - tiered wedding cake  ,  with the little people on top .   thanks .  but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was .  
i had no idea .  and that - that pillowcase thing ,  i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun .  
sometimes we were .  
come on .  you gotta help me figure out what to do .  okay ?  
okay .  
come on .   
that was pretty intense huh ?  
yeah .   hey ,  i hope ross didn &apos;t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here !  
ooh !  i thought of a good flaw !  ross pops his gum !  
oh ,  right !   wait a minute ,  i do that too .  
yeah ,  i know .  it drives me crazy .   
i &apos;ll get it .

why aren &apos;t you guys at the movie ?  
well ,  we were !  but ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out !  
i had to talk loud because the movie was loud !  
 he &apos;s talking to london !  
but why ?  !  did he get in touch with emily ?  
well no ,  not yet .  he &apos;s calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her .  
 i - i - i don &apos;t care if i said some other girl &apos;s name you prissy ,  old twit !  
ross !  way to suck up to the family .  
 hey !  
oh no - no - no - no - no - no ,  vomit tux !  no - no ,  vomit tux !  
don &apos;t worry ,  i had it dry - cleaned .  
vomit tux ?  who vomited ony &apos;know what ,  what you up to joe ?  
well ,  i &apos;m doing this telethon thing on tv and my agent got me a job as co - host !  
oh that &apos;s great !  
a little uh ,  good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure ,  now that &apos;s the kind of math joey likes to do !  
ugh ,  pbs !  
what &apos;s wrong with pbs ?  
ugh ,  what &apos;s right with them ?  
why dont you like pbs ,  pheebs ?  
okay ,   &apos;cause right after my mom killed herself ,  i was just in this really bad place ,  y &apos;know personally .  so ,  i just thought that it &apos;d make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street ,   &apos;cause they were so nice when i was a little kid !  no one ever wrote back .  
well y &apos;know a lot of those muppets don &apos;t have thumbs .  
all i got was a lousy key chain !  and by that time i was living in a box .  i didn &apos;t have keys !  
i &apos;m sorry pheebs ,  i just ,  y &apos;know ,  i just wanted to do a good deed .  like - like you did with the babies .  
this isn &apos;t a good deed ,  you just wanted to get on tv !  this is totally selfish .  
whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what about you ,  having those babies for your brother ?  talk about selfish !  
what - what are you talking about ?  !  
well ,  yeah ,  it was a really nice thing and all ,  but it made you feel really good right ?  
yeah .  so ?  
it made you feel good ,  so that makes it selfish .  look ,  there &apos;s no unselfish good deeds ,  sorry .  
yes there are !  there are totally good deeds that are selfless .  
well ,  may i ask for one example ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s y &apos;know there &apos;sno you may not !   
that &apos;s because all people are selfish .  
are you calling me selfish ?  !  
are you calling you people ?   yeah ,  well sorry to burst that bubble ,  pheebs ,  but selfless good deeds don &apos;t exist .  okay ?  and you the deal on santa clause right ?  
i &apos;m gonna find a selfless good dead .  i &apos;m gonna beat you ,  you evil genius .   
 hello ,  ross ?  
ross ,  i &apos;m only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives .  good - bye !  
really ?  about what ?  
i miss you to .  well ,  at least i think i do .  
 yay !   
hey ,  joey ,  when you said the deal with santa clause ,  you meant ?  
that he doesn &apos;t exist .  
so chandler ,  have you heard about monica &apos;s secret boyfriend ?  
uhh ,  yeah .  she uh ,  she uh ,  she uh might &apos;ve mentioned him .  
so mon ,  when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man ?  
ohh ,  he &apos;s really shy .  i - i dont think he &apos;s up to meeting everyone yet .  
yeah ,  i don &apos;t think he &apos;s up to meeting everyone yet .  
i dont care !  i wanna meet this guy who &apos;s the best sex she ever had !   
really ?  !  that &apos;s what you heard ?   you said that ?  
i might &apos;ve said that .   why is that funny ?  
because i &apos;m very happy for him !   and you ,  you lucky dog !  
 hi !  
hey !  
well ,  emily &apos;s willing to work on the relationship .  
yes !  
that &apos;s great !  
in london !  
what ?  !  
she wants me to move to london .  
but you live here !   you know that .  
what - what - what are you gonna do ?  
i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m sure your ex - wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife .  
 how ya doin &apos; ?  welcome .  good to see ya !  
that &apos;s great .  but uh ,  i &apos;m not really expecting a lot of calls .  
but i &apos;m the host !  
i cannot believe i can &apos;t find a selfless good deed !  y &apos;know that old guy that lives next to me ?  well ,  i snuck over there and - and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop .  but he caught me and force - fed me cider and cookies .  then i felt wonderful .  that old jackass !  
maybe joey &apos;s right .  maybe all good deeds are selfish .  
i will find a selfless good deed !   &apos;cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right !  
 hey ,  monica ?  can i ask you a cooking question ?  
sure !  
if you &apos;re cooking on the stove ,  does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard ?  
chandler !   is he ?  
well ,  y &apos;know i - i - i think i &apos;m gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend .  
i understand that would be difficult .  
i don &apos;t know ,  it &apos;s just 
all right .  
i did .  now i &apos;m the idiot .  
ross ,  there &apos;s one thing that really scares me still .  
well ,  you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family ,  all my friends .  
and then after decided to forgive you ,  seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her .  
i mean ,  i can &apos;t - i can &apos;t be in the same room as her !  it drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her !  
all right .  i &apos;ll come to new york and we &apos;ll try and make this work .  
so i asked emily if she would come to new york ,  and she said yes .  
yes !  
ooh - ohh !  
great !  
no - no - no !  only if i promise never to see rachel again .  
why ?  
what ?  !  you can &apos;twhat did you tell her ?  
i told her i &apos;d have to think about it .  i mean ,  how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision ?   i &apos;m actually asking you !  
well ,  you can &apos;t just not see rachel anymore ,  she &apos;s one of your best friends .  
yeah !  but ,  he can &apos;t not exactly see emily ,  i mean that &apos;s his wife .  
yeah .  
that &apos;s true !  
yeah ,  but you &apos;ve known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life .  
that &apos;s true !  
no ,  you cannot .  
thanks for the help ,  problem solved .    
 hello .  
 hey mon !  
oh hey joey !  we &apos;ve been watching all day ,  when are you gonna be on tv ?

uh ,  listen ,  i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day .  
oh that was yours ?  uh ,  yeah ,  we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars .  
william sonoma ,  fall catalog ,  page 27 .  
expect it in 4 - 6 weeks .   umm ,  hey ,  umm ,  joey &apos;s gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day ,  we have the whole place to ourselves .  
yeah ,  so ?  
well i just ,  thought maybe you &apos;d wanna book some time with the best you &apos;d ever had .  
y &apos;know what ,  champ ?  i think i &apos;ll pass .  
why ?  
why ?   
 pbs telethon .  
 hey joey ,  i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed .  i just went down to the park and i let a bee sting me .  
what ?  !  what good is that gonna do anybody ?  
well ,  it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends .  the bee is happy and i am definitely not .  
now ,  y &apos;know the bee probably died after he stung ya .  
 aw ,  dammit !    
hey ,  excuse me ,  would you mind switching with me ?  
 okay ,  that &apos;s it .  i cannot make this decision !  it is too difficult ,  so i &apos;m just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate .   
a magic eight ball ?  !  you can &apos;t be serious ,  you can &apos;t make this decision with a toy !  
ooh ,  it &apos;s not a toy .  
well ,  i don &apos;t know what else to do .  i mean ,  i either keep my wife and lose one of my - my - my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before i &apos;m 30 !  so - so if anyone has - has a better suggestion ,  let &apos;s hear it !   &apos;cause i - i got nothing !  all right ,  don &apos;t be shy ,  any suggestion will do .   okay then .  here we go .  magic 8 ball ,  should i never see rachel again ?   ask again later .  later is not good enough .   ask again later .  what the hell !  this is broken !  it - it is broken !  
 pbs telethon .  
 hi joey .  
hey pheebs !  
i would like to make a pledge .  i would like to donate $200 .  
$200 ?  are you sure pheebs ?  i mean ,  after what sesame street did to ya ?  
oh ,  i &apos;m still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who &apos;s moms didn &apos;t kill themselves ,  so by supporting them ,  i &apos;m doing a good thing ,  but i &apos;m not happy about it .  so there ,  a selfless good deed .  
and you don &apos;t a little good about donating the money ?  
no ,  it sucks .  i was saving up to buy a hamster .  
a hamster ?  what ,  those things are like 10 bucks .  
yeah ,  not the one i had my eye on .  thank you viewers !  the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers  oh boy !  and may i say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers ,   mr .  joseph tribbiani !  
 look ,  maybe i got carried away before .  but there &apos;s something you gotta know .  if i &apos;m the best ,  it &apos;s only because you &apos;ve made me the best .  
keep talking .  
i mean i was nothing before you .  call the other girls and ask .  which wouldn &apos;t take long .  but when i &apos;m with you ,  and we &apos;re together ,  oh my god .  
really ?  
oh - aw my god !  now ,  i understand if you never want to sleep with me again ,  but that would be wrong .  we &apos;re too good !  we owe it ,  to sex !  
well ,  if we owe it ?   oh my when is joey gonna be home ?  
well ,  i was kinda hoping we could do this without him .   oh no - no - no ,  leave the gloves on .

oh weird ,  chandler just told us he &apos;s got a conference there !  
oh now that - that - that &apos;s funny ,  it seems like chandler &apos;s conference could &apos;ve been in connecticut or vermont .  
i &apos;m not in charge of where the conference is held .  do you want people to think it &apos;s a fake conference ?  it &apos;s a real conference .  
 hey .

wait a minute !  so when emily comes you &apos;re just ,  you &apos;re not gonna see rachel anymore ?  
well look ,  i &apos;m just trying to focus on the  &quot; i get to see my wife ,  &quot;  part ,  all right ?  and not the part that makes me do this .   
wow ,  so you guys are ,  you &apos;re never gonna be in the same room together ?  how is that even gonna work ?

 hi ,  guys !  
hi !  
uh ,  hey !  
what &apos;s going on ?  
we &apos;re flipping monica &apos;s mattress .

hey ,  joey &apos;s ass !  what are you doing ?  
 well ,  remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything ?  well ,  when ross said rachel at the wedding ,  i figured it was gonna happen again ,  so i hid this in here .  
ooh ,  candy bars ,  crossword puzzles 
ooh ,  madlibs ,  mine !   
condoms ?  
you don &apos;t know how long we &apos;re gonna be in here !  we may have to repopulate the earth .

okay ,  y &apos;know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage ?  
yeah ,  i told you to give emily whatever she wants .  
and while that was good advice ,  you should know that what - what she wants

that &apos;s crazy !  you can &apos;t do that !  what are you going to tell her ?    oh god .  ohh ,  you already agreed to this ,  haven &apos;t you ?  
it &apos;s awful i know ,  i mean ,  i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work .  and i do ,  i have to make this marriage work .  i have too .  but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here .  
ohh !  lucky me !  oh my god !  that is good news ,  ross !  i think that &apos;s the best news i &apos;ve heard since le poo died !  
you have no idea what a nightmare this has been .  this is so hard .

hey ,  you &apos;re back too !  
yeah .  umm ,  chandler can i talk to you outside for a second ?  
hey ,  how was your chef thing ?  
oh ,  it was awful .   i guess some people just don &apos;t appreciate really good food .  
well ,  maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea .  
chandler !   
monica .    
okay ,  i &apos;d like to know how much the room was because i &apos;d like to pay my half .  
okay ,  fine ,  $300 .  
300 dollars ?  !  
yeah ,  just think of it as $25 per room !  
urghh !  !  
 what are you guys woofing about ?  
chandler stole a twenty from my purse !  
you should &apos;ve seen the look on her face .  i don &apos;t want rachel to hate me !  i don &apos;t know what to do .  
you want my advice ?  
yes !  please !  
you &apos;re not gonna like it .  
that &apos;s okay .  
you got married to fast .  
that &apos;s not advice !  
i told ya .

maybe i could do it .  
 hi !  
hi ,  rach .  
hi !

i - i - i don &apos;t know if this falls under this category ,  but uh ,  ross is right back there .   
that &apos;s not ross !  
oh no !  not that guy !  he does look like him though .

oh my god ,  its happening .  it &apos;s already started .  i &apos;m kip .  
hey ,  you &apos;re not kip !  
 do you even know who kip is ?

oh ,  that poor bastard .  
see ?  yeah ,  you told me the story .  he and monica dated when they broke up they couldn &apos;t even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened ?  he got phased out !  
you &apos;re not gonna be phased out !  
well ,  of course i am !  it &apos;s not gonna happen to ross !  he &apos;s your brother .   he &apos;s your old college roommate .  ugh ,  it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group .  i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go .  
ehh !  !  
 hey !  
hey ,  mr .  bing .  that uh ,  hotel you stayed at called .  said someone left an eyelash curler in your room .  
yes that was mine .  
 &apos;cause i figured you &apos;d hooked up with some girl and she &apos;d left it there .  
yes that would have made more sense .  
phoebe ?   i &apos;m sorry about the whole lifting out thing .   you gotta come with me !  
come where ?  
wherever i go .  come on you and me ,  we &apos;ll - we &apos;ll start a new group ,  we &apos;re the best ones .

 rachel &apos;s at work .    
hey !  
hey !  
hello !  
hey ,  what &apos;s that ?  
yeah ,  my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother .  can you believe it ?  !  a year ago i didn &apos;t even have a family ,  and now i have heirlooms for crying out loud .   
eeeee -  - ohh !  !  god !   
argh - argh !  !   ooh ,  soft .  is this mink ?  
yeah !  why would my mother send me a fur ?  doesn &apos;t she know me but at all !  plus ,  i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make !  
yeah ,  just some 9 - year - old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour .   that didn &apos;t happen ,  i made that up !  
oh ,  ross ?  ross !  you can &apos;t put up flyers in here .  
you can &apos;t .  
what is that ?  
oh ,  umm ,  i &apos;m just getting rid of a couple of things .  
 this is all of your things .  
yes ,  yes it is !  no ,  but it &apos;s good it &apos;semily thinks we should get all new stuff .  stuff that &apos;s just ours ,  together .  y &apos;know brand new .  
so basically ,  this is a getting - rid - of - everything - rachel - ever - used sale .  
i &apos;ll take it all .  
hey ,  ross ,  you &apos;re okay with that ?  
look ,  if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york ,  i &apos;m sure everything will be fine .  
okay ,  but don &apos;t you think this is a little extreme ?  
after what i did ?  can you blame her ?  
oh my god !  you got off easy !  when my friend silvie &apos;s husband said someone else &apos;s name in bed ,  she cursed him and turned his thingy green .   
 what is he doing ?  what ,  emily ,  thinks ross &apos;s furniture has got rachel coodies ?  
now calm down joey .  
no !  everything &apos;s gettin &apos; all messed up ,  y &apos;know ?  emily won &apos;t let ross see rachel ,  we &apos;re not gonna stop seeing rachel ,  hence ross stops seeing us !  
oh ,  i hate this .  everything &apos;s changing .  
yeah i know ,  we &apos;re losing ross ,  joey said hence 
look ,  i &apos;m not happy about this either ,  but y &apos;know if - if ross says he &apos;s happy then we &apos;re just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves .  are you cool with that ?  
ohh ,  whoa god !  storage rooms give me the creeps !  monica ,  come on please hurry up honey !  please ?  
rachel ,  if you want the little round waffles ,  you gotta have to wait until i find the little waffle iron .  
i want the little round waffles .  
all right .   op ,  here it is !  right underneath the can of - of bug bomb .  i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison ?   
okay ,  y &apos;know what ?  i &apos;ll - i &apos;ll have toast !   
arghhhh !  !  !  !  !  !   
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do about this coat .

 no - no - no ,  it &apos;s just a bit sudden .   no ,  it &apos;s great .  okay ?  i &apos;m totally on board .  i love you too ,  all righty .  bye .   
what &apos;s the matter ross ?  
nothing .  oh ,  actually ,  great news !  i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like i &apos;m moving to a new apartment .  woo - hoo !  
why ?  
well ,  her thought is ,  and i agree ,  fresh new furniture ,  why not a fresh new apartment ?  her cousin has this great place to sublet ,  it &apos;s got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other .  
that &apos;s way uptown !  that &apos;s like three trains away !   which is great !  i love to ride that rail !  
so you &apos;re really okay with this ?  
yes !  yes !  i mean it &apos;s - it &apos;s kinda far from work ,  but uh ,  y &apos;know ,  i &apos;ll get so much done on the commute .  i - i &apos;ve been given the gift of time !  
now that &apos;s so funny ,  because last christmas i got the gift of space .  we should get them together and make a continuum .   
now he &apos;s movin &apos; ?  man ,  what is emily doing to him ?   ow !  !  he &apos;s not even here !  !  !   
you guys !  you guys !  
we were ,  we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man !  
it was like this crazy - eyed ,  hairy beast man !  he was like a ,  like a bigfoot or a yeti or something !  
and he came at us with an axe ,  so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him !  
 yeah ,  i - i - i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass !  
uhh ,  like dark hair ,  bushy beard ?  
yeah !  
yeah ,  you fogged danny .  
please !  we did not fog danny !  who &apos;s danny ?  
dan just moved in downstairs .  yeah ,  he just got back from like this four - month trek in the andes .  nice fella .  
yeah ?  
hi !  you might not remember us ,  but we are the girls that fogged you .  
okay .   
yesss ?  
hi !  sorry to bother you ,  but i don &apos;t think we can accept your acceptance of our apology ,  it just doesn &apos;t really seem like you mean it .  
o - kay !   
wow !  that guy is so rude !  
really !  what is with that guy ?  i mean you &apos;d forgive me if i fogged you .  
well you did a little bit .  
oh my god ,  honey ,  i &apos;m so sorry !  
i totally forgive you !  
really ?  
hey !  
hey !  
so listen ,  you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium ?  
crematorium chris ?  sure !  
he says ,  that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm ,  y &apos;know ,  bring in the next person i know who dies .   
oh my god !  oh my god ,  look at these pelts !  
don &apos;t get too attached ,  she &apos;s having it cremated .  
what ?  uhh ,  phoebe ,  honey ,  honey ,  i know you &apos;re quirky and i get a big kick out of it ,  we all do actually ,  but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature !  not nature ,  fashion !  
 i know i miss you too .  i can &apos;t wait to see you .  i love you .  bye .   
okay ,  what is in here ?  rocks ?  
no - no ,  this is my collection of fossil samples .  
so ,  rocks .   
i &apos;m really gonna miss this apartment .  y &apos;know ,  ben - ben took his first steps right over there .   
ohh .  hey ,  remember when i ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little ?  
i loved this place !  to tell you the truth ,  i wish i didn &apos;t have to move .  
uhh ,  are you saying that you &apos;re not entirely happy about this ?  
well ,  i mean if uh ,  if emily gave me a choice 
you do have a choice !  !  ross ,  why are you listening to her ?  !  are you ,  are you crazy ?  !  
why ?  
it &apos;s not right what emily wants you to do !  she is totally -  - owww !  !  stop pinching me !  look ,  now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy ,  right ?  well he just told me that he &apos;s not entirely happy .  
what &apos;s going on ?  
we all hate emily !  
nooo !  !  
no ,  ross ,  we do not hate emily .  we - we just ,  we just think that you &apos;re having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy .  
yeah !  
look ,  we just think that maybe she &apos;s being a little unreasonable .  
yes !  yes !  unreasonable !  
unreasonable ?  how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married !  you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work !  all right ,  it &apos;s about compromise !  do you always like it ?  no !  do you do it ?  yes !  because it &apos;s not all laughing ,  happy ,  candy in the sky ,  drinking coffee at central perk all the time !  it &apos;s real life ,  okay ?  it &apos;s what grown - ups do !   
god ,  i feel so guilty about ross .  
oh ,  i know .  
i kinda feel like it &apos;s my fault .   
kind of ?  if you just kept this to yourself none of this would &apos;ve happened .  
well ,  i &apos;m keeping so many things to myself these days ,  something was bound to slip out !   
well ,  i think it &apos;s very brave what you said .   
all right ,  i can &apos;t sit here anymore .  i have to walk places .   
pheebs ,  what are you doing with the coat ?  how about the whole animal rights thing ?  
so you like the short hair better .  
i had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh ,  fogger smell .  
absolutely .  some people are just into appearances .  
that &apos;s cool .  cool .   
come on ,  you got the shopping bags and the sack &apos;s catalog .

vogue !  hey ,  so tell me about this jane eyre woman .  
no !  you should &apos;ve read it yourself !  
come on phoebe !  dont be such a goodie - goodie !  
fine !  okay ,  all right ,  so jane eyre ,  first of all ,  you &apos;d think she &apos;s a woman ,  but she &apos;s not .  she &apos;s a cyborg .  
a cyborg ?  !  isn &apos;t that like a robot ?  !  
yeah ,  this book was light years ahead of its time .  everybody think about jane eyre ?  
umm ,  rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights .  
uh ,  thank you phoebe .  umm ,  well ,  what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh ,  how the book was so ahead of its time .  
hey .  
hey .  okay ,  so umm ,  since that video camera thing didn &apos;t work out uh ,  i thought that i would give you just a little preview .   
 you &apos;re naked in this picture !  
i know .   
ross ?  
 hey chandler .   monica !  
ross ,  are you okay ?  
i &apos;m fine !  i saw a psychiatrist at work today .  
why ?  !  
on account of my rage .  
which i may say ,  right now ,  is out of control .  
he gave me a pill for it .  
a pill ?  
uh - huh .  well ,  when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again ,  so he offered me a tranquilizer .  and i thought was a good idea so ,  i took it .  
wait a minute ,  they &apos;re making you take time off work ?  
and you &apos;re okay with that ?  
 ugh ,  that was so embarrassing !  i can &apos;t believe you let me go on and on like that !  
 i &apos;m sorry .  it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop .  
that was not funny !  
well ,  i snapped !  okay ?  you weren &apos;t taking the class seriously .  
phoebe ,  come on !  what is the big deal ?  i thought this was going to be something we could do together !  y &apos;know ,  i thought it would be fun !  
well ,  yeah !  fun is good ,  but y &apos;know i also wanted to learn .  y &apos;know ,  people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school .  
 oh my god !  that &apos;s monica !  !  
oh no - no - no !  no - no - no - no - no - no - no !  
you get away from me !  !  you sick ,  sick ,  sick ,  sick - o !  !

it &apos;s okay !  it &apos;s good !  it &apos;s good .  it &apos;s a disease !  
no !  no !  i am not a sex addict !  
yes you are !  that &apos;s the only way to explain all this stuff !  
no it isn &apos;t !  no ,  it &apos;s not .  because you can also explain it with the truth !  
well ,  what is the truth ?  
yeah ,  what &apos;s going on ?  
what &apos;s going on ?  
 i slept with monica .  
well let &apos;s  . let &apos;s see what everybody thinks of that ?  
oh no !  
you slept with my sister ?  
uh yes ,  but it was ,  we just did it once uh ,  in london .  
this is not good for my rage .   
monica ,  is this true ?  
of course it &apos;s true !  how else would you explain all the weird stuff that &apos;s been going on ?  
yes it &apos;s true .  
okay ,  but if it only happened that one time ,  how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day ?  
ahhoy !  that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london .  right monica ?  
i guess i wanted to keep it  as a souvenir .  
my god monica !  !  
are you sure joe ?  are you sure you &apos;re not just a sex addict ?  
no !  if anyone &apos;s a sex addict here ,  it &apos;s monica !  yeah .  yeah .  she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london !  
so that &apos;s why she gave you a naked picture of herself .  
that makes sense !  
and the video camera ?  
uhh ,  monica ?  
i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey .  
but sadly i could not be enticed .  
unbelievable !  i mean you really kept joey &apos;s underwear ?  !  why ?  why would you do that ?  !  
i &apos;m monica .  i &apos;m disgusting .  i stalk guys and keep their underpants .

hey ,  umm ,  can i ask you guys something ?  
uh ,  i don &apos;t have any brothers so i don &apos;t know ,  but uh ,  did you guys wrestle ?  
oh - oh ,  yeah .

uh ,  you weighted 200 pounds .  
still ,  i was quick as a cat .  
well ,  i met danny &apos;s sister yesterday ,  and uh that was actually the girl on the subway .  
oh ,  you &apos;re kidding .  
yeah ,  they were very y &apos;know wrestley .  but ,  i guess that &apos;s normal ?

joey &apos;s not going .  
 i didn &apos;t finish my five pages .  
well ,  why can &apos;t you do them tomorrow ?  
because tomorrow he &apos;s redoing yesterday &apos;s pages .  
yesterday &apos;s pages did not reflect my best work .  
 why don &apos;t you cut him a little slack ?  okay ?  maybe if he relaxes a little bit ,  he &apos;ll get some work done .  
i think he &apos;s been relaxing enough ,  thanks to you and fireball .  
dude ,  if you think fireball &apos;s relaxing ,  you &apos;ve obviously have never played .  
the only reason you &apos;re doing this to joey is because you &apos;re bored .  okay ,  it &apos;s not his fault that you &apos;re unemployed .  
i am not unemployed .  i &apos;m on sabbatical !  
come on look guys ,  don &apos;t fight .  
and the reason i &apos;m doing this is because i am joey &apos;s friend .  and if you were a good friend ,  you &apos;d be doing the same thing .  
oh ,  so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk ?  
if it does ?  then you &apos;re an amazing friend of mine .  
hey - hey guys ,  hey !  how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball ?  huh ?  i &apos;ll go unhook the smoke detectors !  
how about we settle this right now !   there !  now ,  no one &apos;s going to the game .  ha - ha - ha !  
i paid for those tickets !  
no you didn &apos;t .  you said you would ,  but you never did !  
so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera !  
oh ,  y &apos;know the same thing happened to me one time .  
when did that happen to you ?  !  
don &apos;t you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picturei didn &apos;t have my camera !  
yep .   i &apos;m gonna wear these on our date tonight .  
oh ,  great !  
okay ,  bye !   oh my god !  !  
that was unbelievable !  
okay ,  see ?  i told you !

oh whoa - whoa - whoa !  wait a minute ,  open up your hand; let me take a look .   quarter .  dime .  lint ?  not interested in that .   what &apos;s this ?  a canadian coin ?  get outta here !    
uh ,  phoebe we &apos;ve been getting complaints and uh ,  we &apos;re gonna move you to a less high - profile spot .  
umm ,  ginger &apos;s gonna take over this corner .

oh ,  hey rach !  i thought we said seven ?  
what ?  !  why ?  !  
oh great !  that special bond again !  why do women have such a problem with the fact that i &apos;m close with my sister ?

are you close with them ?  
okay ,  listen ,  i really like you .  okay ?  i think this can go somewhere .  so what if i &apos;m close to my family ,  are you gonna let that stand in the way of us ?  
 what ?  
oh hey !  there &apos;s some kids playing in the street ,  you wanna go down there and give them a project ,  ruin their day ?

yay !  
great !  now ,  we can go to the ranger game !   last night !

i guess when you don &apos;t have so many distractions ,  it &apos;s easier for you to focus .  huh ?  
yeah or also when you don &apos;t have somebody breathing down your neck all the live long day !  !  
yeah ,  well ,  that &apos;s fine ,  but the important thing is that i finished it .  and uh ,  i think it &apos;s really good ,  but y &apos;know it &apos;d really help me is if i could hear it .  so would you guys read it for me ?

ooh !  that &apos;s a good one !  mine is to pilot a commercial jet .  
that &apos;s good one too ,  pheebs .  now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who &apos;s resolution is to plummet to their deaths .  
maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends ,  especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane .  
she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us .  
in fact ,  i &apos;ll bet you 50 bucks that you can &apos;t go the whole year without making fun of us .  eh ,  y &apos;know what ,  better yet ?  a week .  
i &apos;ll take that bet my friend .  and you know what ,  paying me the 50 bucks could be the  &quot; new thing you do that day !  &quot;   and it starts right now !  
all right ,  my new year &apos;s resolution is to learn how to play the guitar .  
ohh .  
really ?  !  how come ?  
well ,  y &apos;know those special skills i have listed on my resume ?  i would love it would be great if one of those was true .  
do you want me to teach you ?  i &apos;m a great teacher .

well ,  i taught me and i love me .  
yeah that &apos;d be great !  thanks pheebs !  
op ,  look !  claire forgot her glasses !  and she &apos;s gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend ,  who ,  i hear ,  needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer ,  if you know what i &apos;m talking about .  
hey rach ,  maybe your resolution should be to umm ,  gossip less .  
i don &apos;t gossip !   
well ,  maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y &apos;know kinda like a public service ,  it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m a gossip .  i mean ,  would you call ted kopel a gossip ?  
well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs ,  i would .  
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .  
okay !   hey !  
i just asked that girl out .

okay ,  so now they know that you know and they don &apos;t know that rachel knows ?  
yes ,  but y &apos;know what ?  it doesn &apos;t matter who knows what .  now ,  enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know !  then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over !  
or ,  we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own .  
wh - what do you mean ?  
well y &apos;know every time that they say that like they &apos;re doing laundry we &apos;ll just give them a bunch of laundry to do .

what &apos;s going on ?  
you are so cute !  how did you get to be so cute ?  
well ,  my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny .  
okay ,  now you &apos;re even cuter !  !  
y &apos;know that is a popular opinion today i must say .  
what ?  
the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house ,  i think ,  i think phoebe was hitting on me .  
what are you talking about ?  
i &apos;m telling you i think phoebe thinks i &apos;m foxy .  
that &apos;s not possible !  
ow !  
i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s just ,  phoebe just always thought you were ,  you were charming in a ,  in a sexless kind of way .  
oh ,  y &apos;know i - i can &apos;t hear that enough .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i think that you just misunderstood her .  
no ,  i didn &apos;t misunderstand ,  okay ?  she was all over me !  she touched my bicep for crying out loud !  
this bicep ?  
hey mon ,  what are you doing now ?  wanna come see a movie with us ?  
uhh ,  y &apos;know actually i was gonna do some laundry .

okay .  
okay great ,  hold on a sec !   oh ,  here you go !  you don &apos;t mind do ya ?  that would really help me out a lot !  thanks !  
i mean i - i don &apos;t i think i have enough quarters .  
i have quarters !   
 hey !  
hey ross !  any word on the apartment yet ?  
well ,  i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he &apos;s already had like a hundred applicants .  
oh .  
no - no ,  i got the edge .  i know it &apos;s not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to tip the scales in my direction .  check it out ,  you can probably see it from the window .   
oh ,  is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it ?  
no .  
that new mountain bike ?  
no .  
well what did you send ?  
a basket of mini - muffins .  
but there &apos;s a whole table of mini - muffin baskets .  which one did you send ?  
the small one .  
what ?  !  you - you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment ?  
well yeah !  someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins .  it was the best day .  
your work makes me sad .  
oh man !  i want that place so much !  !  i was so sure that was gonna work !  there &apos;s twelve bucks i &apos;ll never see again !   
all right honey ,  we &apos;d better go if we wanna catch that movie .  
bye !  
bye chandler !   i miss you already .   
 okay ,  did you see that ?  !  with the inappropriate and the pinching !  !  
actually ,  i did !  
okay ,  so now do you believe that she &apos;s attracted to me ?  
ohhh ,  oh my god !  oh my god !  she knows about us !  
are you serious ?  
phoebe knows and she &apos;s just trying to freak us out !  that &apos;s the only explanation for it !  
 joey !   
yeah ?  
phoebe knows about us !  
well i didn &apos;t tell them !  
them ?  !  who &apos;s them ?  
uhhh ,  phoebe and joey .  
joey !  
and rachel .  i would &apos;ve told you but they made me promise not to tell !  
oh man !  
i &apos;m sorry !  but hey ,  it &apos;s over now ,  right ?  because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing !  
unless 
no !  not unless !  look this must end now !  
oh man ,  they think they are so slick messing with us !  but see they don &apos;t know that we know that they know !  so 
noooo .  
oh ross ,  honey you gotta stop torturing yourself !  
yeah ,  why don &apos;t you just find another apartment ?  
look i &apos;ve already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one !  
y &apos;know what you should do ?  
huh ?  
you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him .  yeah !  like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm ,  sandwiches .  or uh ,  or my underwear .  
i &apos;m listening .  
 see ?  
that is a great idea !  and !  i know ugly naked guy because we &apos;ve been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge !  oh ,  let &apos;s see now he had the trampoline .  
he broke that .  
well ,  he had gravity boots .  
yeah ,  he broke those too .  
so he likes to break stuff .  
okay ,  i &apos;ve got to go pick up ben but i - i will figure something out .   hey ,  didn &apos;t he used to have a cat ?  
i wouldn &apos;t bring that up ,  it would probably just bum him out .  
yeah ,  poor cat ,  never saw that big butt coming .  
right .    
hello !   oh yeah !  hey !  hold on a second she &apos;s right here !   it &apos;s chandler .  
 oh ?   hello you .  
hello phoebe ,  i &apos;ve been thinking about you all day .

yeah ,  listen ,  joey isn &apos;t gonna be here tonight so why don &apos;t you come over and i &apos;ll let you uh ,  feel my bicep .  or maybe more .

howard &apos;s the handy man !

 sounds like a fun party .  
hmm .  look ,  ross ,  if you want your neighbors to like you ,  why don &apos;t you just pay the hundred bucks ?  the party &apos;s gonna cost you way more than that .  
it doesn &apos;t matter !  it &apos;s my principles !  we &apos;re talking about my principles !  
okay ,  i thought it was about your neighbors liking you .  
oh ,  they &apos;ll like me .  once they come to my awesome par - tay !  okay ,  i gotta run .  i gotta go get some nametags .   
and that crazy party animal will be your brother - in - law .  
very ,  very funny ,  but don &apos;t say things like that in front of monica .  i don &apos;t want you putting any ideas in her head .  
umm ,  chandler ,  you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica &apos;s head .  
wh - wh - why ?  !  
well ,  because she loves you and because you love her .  
yeah ,  so ,  what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?  !  
hey ,  chandler ,  don &apos;t freak out !  i &apos;m telling you something you already know !  come on ,  she broke up with richard because he didn &apos;t want to have babies .  and she &apos;s a woman ,  and she &apos;s almost 30 ,  and y &apos;know it &apos;s monica .  
i don &apos;t see it that way .  okay ?  because ,  i see two monicas ,  the one that was my friend ,  who lived across the hall ,  and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica ,  who i just started to date .  now ,  who &apos;s to say what she wants ?  !  im right .  i &apos;m right .  am i right ?

yeah ,  but you &apos;re making me look bad !

so uh ,  what did you tell them about me ?  
oh ,  i was telling them about you and emily .  y &apos;know ,  try to get some sympathy .  
ohh .   
but somehow you came off as the bad guy .  
what ?  !  
yeah ,  i think i told it wrong .  y &apos;know ,  we should talk about that because i don &apos;t totally understand what happened there .  
 ohh ,  this cake is really good !  
go back to 3 - b ,  3 - b !  
obviously i didn &apos;t think they were gonna start throwing things .  i just thought if i kept insulting everyone ,  you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero .  
where &apos;s monica ?  !  where is she ?  i need to talk to her !  it &apos;s urgent !  is she here ?  
 i &apos;m monica .  
i need to talk to you ,  it &apos;s urgent !

wait what - wh - wh - what are you doing ?  !  
 monica 
no - no ,  don &apos;t - don &apos;t - don &apos;t do it !  
will you marry me ?   
oh - no .  no .  no .  
what a bad idea !  
ohhhh ,  i cannot look at it !   
chandler ,  why are you doing this ?  
i don &apos;t know .  but i know i &apos;m not afraid to do this .  
chandler .  
i &apos;m doing this because i &apos;m sorry ?  
do you umm ,  you really think the best reason to get married is because you &apos;re sorry ?  
no ,  the best reason to get married is pregnancy .  sorry is pretty much fourth y &apos;know ,  behind being ready and actually wanting to get married .   will you be my wife ?  
 chandler ,  umm ,  i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m kinda wishing everyone wasn &apos;t here right now .  
honey !  do you know that none of that stuff came from me ?  !  i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now !  
yeah i know ,  but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys .   
who ?  two divorces and joey ?  !  
hey !  
she &apos;s right y &apos;know .  
yeah ,  but still ,  cheap shot !  
y &apos;know what ?  y &apos;know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own ?  well ,  you &apos;re not ready for that .  
i didn &apos;t think i was !   
oh my god ,  what would have done if i said yes ?  
hey ross ,  will you pass me that knife ?  
no ,  i will not !  
oh ,  it &apos;s okay .  you don &apos;t have to be so mean about it .  
you &apos;re right ,  i &apos;m sorry .  will you marry me ?   
aw ,  and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week .  
oh no wait pheebs ,  i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you .  but i &apos;m not sure ,  chandler ?  
okay ,  how long is this going to go on .  
well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so ,  a long time .  
this is fun .  hey rach ,  remember that whole  &quot; we were on a break thing ?  &quot;  well ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  will you marry me ?   
that &apos;s not funny .  
hey !

phoebe ,  i bet somebody &apos;s missing that badge .  
yeah ,  i should probably take it back .  ooh ,  but you know what ?  while i &apos;m at the police station ,  i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever ,  so this could be her year !

whoa - whoa - whoa - whoa - whoa - what - what if martin luther king had said that ?   i kinda have a dream !  i dont want to talk about it .  
well ,  it involved monica .  
you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing ?  !  oh ,  that is so cool !   i can &apos;t tell you how many times i &apos;ve dreamt about a girl that he was seeing .   anyway we &apos;re talking about your dream .   i love you .   your dream ?   
don &apos;t worry ,  there wasn &apos;t any sex in it or anything .  i haven &apos;t dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two -  - ish .  
what was the dream about ?  
well ,  okay .  you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle .  y &apos;know like you guys were doing last night .  so ,  that &apos;s it .  i &apos;m in love with monica and i &apos;ll be moving out .  
wait ,  joey !  joey !  that doesnt mean that - that you &apos;re in love with me !  
it - it doesnt ?  
no !  
no ,  it can mean anything .  like uh ,  all of the sudden you &apos;re jealous because i &apos;ve become the apartment stud .  
that kinda sounds like your dream dude .  
or ,  it could mean that - that you saw chandler and me together and we y &apos;know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too .  
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness .  
um - hmm .  
joey ,  look ,  are you attracted to monica ?  right here ,  right now ,  are you attracted to her ?  
 not really .  
well there you have it !  
well sure !  i &apos;m just wearing sweats !   but that &apos;s good that you &apos;re not in love with me ,  because you just want a girlfriend !  
no ,  i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just about just getting a girlfriend .  y &apos;know ?  i mean ,  yeah ,  i can get a girlfriend !  yeah ,  we could sit in the chair and do crosswords ,  but y &apos;know are we ever going to have y &apos;know the closeness like - like you guys have ?  
well y &apos;know ,  monica and i were friends before we started dating .  so maybe - maybe that &apos;s it ?  
friends first ?  that &apos;s interesting .  
you become friends after ?  
no ,  never done that either .  
 hey ,  umm ,  do you guys have that tape measure ?  
oh yeah ,  it &apos;s actually in my bedroom .   
 that &apos;s right .   
 what &apos;s up joey ?  
yeah .  
don &apos;t worry about it .  it &apos;s not a problem .  
 so am i !  
 hey ,  wait a second !  so wait ,  what precinct are you with ?  
oh ,  i know a guy in homicide up there .  
who - who else is in vice up there ?  
sipowicz ?  no ,  i don &apos;t think so .  
no ,  i don &apos;t know him .  
wow umm ,  tell sipowicz i &apos;m real sorry for his loss .  
 hey by the way ,  i &apos;m sure sipowicz is gonna be all right .  i heard that kid from silver spoons is really good .   and where did you find my badge ?  
hey !  joey ,  would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch ?  
oh ,  i &apos;d love too ,  but i got acting class .  but y &apos;know what ?  i guess i can blow that off ,   for you .   
thanks !  
uh ,  hey ,  rach let me ask you something .  uh ,  i was just over there talking to monica and chandler ,  boy they are really tight .  
i know .  
yeah that &apos;s not such a bad situation they got going over there .  i &apos;m thinking of getting me one of those .  
what &apos;s up joe ?  
well ,  the reason i think monica and chandler are so great 
yeah ?  
is because they were friends first .  y &apos;know ?  so i asked myself ,   &quot; who are my friends ?  &quot;  you and phoebe ,  and i saw you first .  so 
 what are you saying ?  
i &apos;m saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch .  
y &apos;know honey ,  umm ,  as uh ,  as flattered as i am that uh ,  you saw me first ,  uhh ,  i just ,  i - i don &apos;t think we should be cranking anything up .  
i &apos;ll treat you real nice .   
 yeah ,  well ,  y &apos;know umm no honey ,  listen i think it &apos;s a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them ,  but i think the way you do it is y &apos;know you meet someone ,  become their friend ,  build a foundation ,  then you ask them out on a date .  don &apos;t hit on your existing friends !  
won &apos;t - won &apos;t that take longer ?  
yeah .  yeah .  oh ,  but once you find it ,  ohh it &apos;s so worth the wait .  
come here to me .  no - no ,  you come here to me .  
 hey ross !  i brought reinforcements .  
oh great !  what ,  you brought joey ?  
well ,  i brought the next best thing .  
 hey !  
chandler ?  !  you brought chandler ?  !  the next best thing would be monica !  
y &apos;know ,  i would be offended ,  but monica is freakishly strong ,  so 
look ,  i - i drew a sketch about how we &apos;re gonna do it .   okay rach ,   that &apos;s you .  that &apos;s the couch .

 oh ,  we &apos;re not seeing a movie !  
you &apos;re not ?  then why did you ask us if we wanted to go ?  
oh umm ,  that &apos;s because i just wanted to y &apos;know walk in on me and chandler while we were ,  y &apos;know ,  doing it all night .  will you excuse me for just a second ?  
yeah !  
okay .   chandler ?  can i see you for a second ?  
uh ,  yeah .  
okay .   we have got to beat them !  {here we go yet again . } 
why ?  
 &apos;cause ,  gary and phoebe think they &apos;re a hotter couple than we are !  
ohh ,  so ?  
so !  so we &apos;ve got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong !  
 hey !   joey and it reads ,   &quot; warning !  intruder !  if you see this creep  -  call the cops !  &quot; ) you should check this out ,  tell the other tenants .  apparently he &apos;s running around looking for some kind of a hot girl .  
 who isn &apos;t ?   
i don &apos;t ,  i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve meet .  i - i &apos;m ross .  
nevermind !   mean you had just moved in .  
i had just moved in .  thank you !  listen umm 
sure !  that would be nice .  
oh !  my number is on there .   give me a call .  
i &apos;ll see you later .   
that was amazing !  
phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner .  
that was amazing .  
we are the hottest !  huh ?  no one is hotter than we are !  you &apos;re the best .  
no ,  you &apos;re the best .  
no ,  you &apos;re the best .  
no ,  you &apos;re the best .  
i am the best .   
 hey guys !   what  &apos;cha been doin &apos; ?   
 hey joey !  isn &apos;t that the girl that waved at you the other day ?  
i don &apos;t know .  but i can see through your sheet .   yeah ,  yeah ,  that &apos;s her .  but y &apos;know what ?  doesn &apos;t matter ,  i &apos;m never gonna get to meet her anyway .  
why ?  
because it &apos;s impossible to find her apartment !  she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe ,  or something .  
what are you talking about ?   she obviously lives on the second floor ,  seventh apartment from the left !  
no .  no .  no .  she lives on the third floor ,  eighth apartment from the left .  
no ,  those first two windows ,   that &apos;s the lobby .  and y &apos;know the other one over there ,  that &apos;s the stairway .  you &apos;ve been counting wrong .  
sure ,  i &apos;ll just get my coat .   could you get that ?  
sure .   joey 
ah ,  first ,  i - i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again .  meeting is being videotaped .  
 okay .  umm ,  well ,  first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh ,  for yelling at you .  
now you &apos;re probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah ,   who did ,  who did not umm ,  yell at you and storm out ,  and i think that &apos;s a big mistake and here &apos;s why .  i made a huge fool of myself and i came back ,  that shows courage .  when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job ,  i said no .  that shows integrity .  and ,  i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage .   okay umm ,  now i know i already said courage ,  but y &apos;know you gotta have courage .  and umm ,  and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace ,  i said no and i was not litigious .  {by the way ,  litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against .  so she didn &apos;t want to sue him .  don &apos;t worry ,  i had to look it up too . } so there you go ,  you got ,  you got  courage ,  you got integrity ,  you got  courage again ,  and not litigious .  look mr 
zelner !  right !  i knew that !  i really ,  really want this job and i think ,  i think i would be really good at it .  
 oh !  you are ?  
really ?  oh thank you !  oh oh ,  would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug ?  
you tired chandler ?  
you better believe he &apos;s tired ,  after the day we had !  if you know what i mean .  you know what i mean ?  
so uh chandler ,  you like that badge i got you ?  
oh yeah ,  it &apos;s so cool .   now i gotta go ,  officer bing has gotta ,  10 - 100 .   that &apos;s pee - pee .   
phoebe ,  you have a ,  a twig in your hair .  
yeah ,  we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around ,  so 
you didn &apos;t !  
we did !  we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code !  
uh - huh .  
i hear ya .  excuse me for just a second !    
hi chandler .  
monica !  this is the men &apos;s room !   isn &apos;t it ?  
yes it is .  you see i &apos;ve always found the men &apos;s bathroom very sexual .  haven &apos;t you ?  
no .  and if i did ,  i don &apos;t think we &apos;d be going out .  monica ,  this is getting ridiculous !  
come on ,  we can &apos;t let them win !  
ugh ,  we have already proved that we are hot !  okay ?  so why - why are you getting so obsessed about this thing ?  !  
because phoebe and gary are in that - can &apos;t - keep - their - hands - off - each - other - doing - it - in - the - park phase !  
 so ?  
i feel really sad that we &apos;re not really there anymore .  
oh wow !  is that what this all have been about ?  
wasn &apos;t it a lot more exciting when we were y &apos;know all over each other all the time ?  
yeah that was great .  that was really great !  but to tell you the truth ,  i &apos;m more excited about where we are right now .  
really ?  
yeah !  i &apos;ve never been in a relationship that &apos;s lasted this long before .  y &apos;know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time ,  i think that &apos;s pretty incredible .  and the fact that this is happening all with you ,  yeah i think that &apos;s pretty exciting .   
that is so sweet .  i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm ,  i feel the same way .  
yeah ?  
yeah .   
y &apos;know what i just realized ?  you just freaked out about our relationship .

yes you did !  admit it !  you freaked out !  
okay ,  i freaked out a little .  
little ?  !  you freaked out big time !  okay ?  and i fixed it !  we have switched places !  i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy ,  irrational screw up !   and now we &apos;re back .  ending credits

weirder than watching his two moms make out ?   
whoa - whoa dad ?  there &apos;s a dad in the commercial ?  
yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it .

oh yeah ,  yeah !  he &apos;s done tons of commercials .  i &apos;ve seen him in like sugar smacks ,  playstation ,  and that one for the phone company .  in fact he was so good in that one ,  he actually convinced me to switch phone companies .  chandler was mad  .  
yeah well ,  he &apos;s not gonna get this one .  ben is way cuter than that kid .  i mean look at him ,  look at you ,

rachel ,  you can go down there ,  you don &apos;t have to smoke .  just say you wanna get some fresh air .

chandler ,  this actually bothers you ?  
yes ,  it does bother me !  and i think it would bother a lot of people .  rachel ,  when you were going out with ross ,  did it bother you when he flirted with other women ?  
uhh ,  no ,  no ,  it bothered me when he slept with other women .  
and thank you ,  for that .

hey ,  do you mind ?  we &apos;re under cover here .  
ross !  
sorry !  sorry !  oh ,   there !   hey gary ,  who am i ?  phone home !   too happy about it . ] 
look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors .  
 are you thinking about me ?  of course you &apos;re not ,  but if you are ,  call me tonight .  okay ,  bye .  
 nooo !  
 i know !  
well thank god you were here !  i mean ,  we have to erase that !  
what ?  !  we can &apos;t do that !  
we have too !  i mean what if ross &apos;s hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together ?  is that what you want ?  ross back with that controlling ,  neurotic ,  crazy emily ?  the emily that wouldn &apos;t let him see you ?  
noo !  oh no !  no !  god no !  he should not get back together with her .  i know that !  you know that !  even ross knows that !  but that still doesnt give us the right to erase his message !  
i &apos;m his sister ,  okay ?  i love him !  i don &apos;t want to see him get hurt !  come on !  doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him ?  
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s the one who needs help .   
no ,  look ,  she &apos;s obviously unstable ,  okay ?  i mean she &apos;s thinking about running out on her wedding day .   okay ,  fine !  but i mean ,  look at the position she &apos;s putting him in !  what &apos;s he gonna do ?  ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage ?  !  i mean ,  who would do that ?  !   okay ,  fine ,  all right ,  but that &apos;s y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s different !  although it did involve a lot of the same people .  
ugh !  
y &apos;know what ,  this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she &apos;s trying to play on him .  
your messages have been erased .  
no .  but that reminds me ,   sign this .  
oh it &apos;s nothing ,  it just says that you can &apos;t sue the city if you scrap your knee or y &apos;know ,  get your head blown off .  
okay ,  here he comes .  what is he doing ?  what the hell is he doing ?  !  
what ?  what ?  what ?  what is it ?  
is everything okay ?  
hey ,  it &apos;s okay .  it was just a car backfire .   hey ,  look at that !  you tried to save your buddy .  you see that ?  you see what he did ?  
 you okay man ?  
uh - huh .  thank joey !  
uh ,  hello !  !  
all right ,  i guess we should go .  
no ,  wait .  wait .  
oh yeah right !   
no ,  monica !  monica !  we have to fix this !  
there &apos;s nothing we can do .  you erased the message !  
yeah well unless we tell him .  
well ,  if you &apos;re gonna be totally rational about this ,  i can &apos;t argue with you !  all right ?  fine ,  if you wanna tell him ,  tell him .  i just don &apos;t want to be a part of it .   
oh ,  maybe that &apos;s emily calling back to leave the exact same message .  
 hey ross !  it &apos;s you !  i just want you to remember this feeling .  you are lucky to be alive !  so live everyday to the fullest .  love yourself ,  okay ?  okay .  oh ,  and also get stamps .  bye !   
wow !  play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away !  
hey ,  anybody want to meet a hero ?  
no ,  joey !  
wait !  hold on !   hi !  
 okay ,  go ahead .  
okay ,  okay ,  so we &apos;re in the car .  right ?  and bang !  a shot was fired .  and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me !  
my god ,  joey !  
 it was a car backfire !  
yeah ,  but - but he didn &apos;t know that !  
yeah ,  i didn &apos;t know that .  
hey joe ,  you ever think about joining the force ?  we could use a guy like you .  
who jumps at loud noises !  
wow !  i could &apos;ve died tonight .  
yeah !  if the car that backfired had run over you !  y &apos;know what ,  i think i &apos;ll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life .   
i do have a newfound respect for life .  
 so you wanna get some dinner ?  
oh yeah ?  well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood .  
all right .  
bye !   
dude !  how come you took off ?  
oh ,  i just went for a walk ,  around the living room .  whatever 
is something wrong ?  
no .  no i &apos;m just tired .  y &apos;know ,  from - from the walk .  
okay .  
you dove in front of ross !  ross !  
that &apos;s what this is about !  oh my god ,  you hate ross !  
i do not hate ross !  
of course you do !  i saved him !  you &apos;re mad at me !  it all adds up !  you want ross out of the picture .  
what picture ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  but i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m hearing !  
look i &apos;m very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire ,  but y &apos;know ,  it could &apos;ve been a bullet and you y &apos;know ,  you didn &apos;t try to save me !  
ohh ,  you &apos;re upset because you think i chose ross over you !  no !  i knew you could take care of yourself .  y &apos;know ,  i mean ross ,  he need help .  he &apos;s not street like us !  
when it comes down to it ,  you would risk your life for ross before you would for me .  that &apos;s the bottom line .  
well ,  no ,  not exactly !  all right ,  look ,  i ,  i wasn &apos;t trying to save ross .  okay ?  my sandwich was next to ross .  all right ?  i was ,  i was trying to save my sandwich .  
from a bullet !  
i know it doesn &apos;t make much sense 
much sense ?  !  
look chandler ,  it was instinct !  okay ?  i just went for it !  
so you risked your life ,  for a sandwich !  
i know it sounds crazy ,  but chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world !  
so you didn &apos;t uh ,  choose ross before me .  
no !  i would never do that !  you - you &apos;re like my brother !  
really ?  !  
yeah !  in fact ,  to prove how much you mean to me ,   here .  
thanks .   
no ,  eh ,  oh - oi ,  easy ,  it &apos;s not a hot dog !   
how good is that ?  
 oh - oi - ho ,  yeah !  
see ?  
hm - hmm .   
oh - whoa - hey ,  dude ,  what are you doing ?  !  
i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me .  
hey !  hi !  
rach ,  what uh ,  what are you doing here ?  
hey !  y &apos;know what ?  you are in our apartment all the time !  okay ?  this is ,  this is just a drop in the bucket mister !  
y &apos;know ,  it - it doesn &apos;t matter .  the important thing is that you &apos;re here .  you &apos;re my friend ,  and you &apos;re here .  oh !   
okay ,  just a little scared .  what &apos;s going on ross ?  
the most amazing thing happened tonight .  i thought my number was up .  i had an actual near death experience !  
what ?  !  what ?  what happened ?  !  
okay ,  okay ,  we were on the ride along with gary ,  right ?  
yeah !  
and somebody took a shot at me !  
 really ?  !  
no ,  a car backfired ,  but  i thought somebody was taking a shot at me .  and rach ,  i i survived !  and i was filled with this - this great respect for life .  y &apos;know ?  i - i want to experience every moment .  i want to seize every opportunity .  i - i am seeing everything so - so clearly now .  
because a car backfired ?  
 okay ,  why are you here ?  
well ,  i - i - i don &apos;t know how this fits into your whole  &quot; seizing &quot;  thing but um ,  emily called you today .  
you talked to her ?  
no ,  she left a message .   but it - it kinda got erased .  there &apos;s just  something wrong with your machine .  
well ,  okay ,  what - what did she say ?  
well ,  uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh ,  she wants you to call her .  
wow !  
now ,  that - that was a good thing that i told you ,  right ?  
huh ?  yeah !  yes ,  of course !  
okay .  thank you !  thank you !  becausei &apos;m sorry ,  all right .  because y &apos;know what ?  she didn &apos;t want menot important .  the point is ,  i was right .  your decision .  okay ?  i was right .   your decision .  
right .  i guess ,  i guess i should call emily .  
okay ,  no ,  that &apos;s not the right decision .  that &apos;s not ,  that &apos;s not right ,  no ross - ross ,  come on !  i mean ,  that woman made you miserable !  okay ,  ross ,  do you really want to get back into that ?  
okay ,  look ,  yesterday i would &apos;ve even considered calling her back ,  but my ex - wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience .  i mean ,  that - that has got to mean something !  
ugh ,  ross !  that was not a near death experience !  that was barely an experience !  
you weren &apos;t there !  okay ,  maybe this is something that i - i &apos;m supposed to seize !  y &apos;know ?  
okay ,  y &apos;know what ?  maybe ,  this is not about seizing stuff .  maybe this is about escaping stuff .  
huh .  
i mean ,  look - look today you escaped  death ,  y &apos;know ?  and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily ?  
that does make sense .  because i do wanna seize some opportunity ,  but i - i really don &apos;t wanna see or talk to her .  
well ,  there you go !  
yeah .  maybe today is just ,  close call day .  
 close call day .  
hey ,  thanks rach .   
ohh ,  honey no problem .  okay .   
oh wait - wait - wait !  the message is blinking .  maybe you didn &apos;t erase it .  
oh ?   
  &quot; hey ross ,  it &apos;s you !  &quot;   oh yeah ,  no that &apos;s - that &apos;s an old message ,  nobody needs to hear that .  
no .   
 hey umm ,  was - was monica here ?  
yeah .  
yeah ,  i want my money back .  
hey pheebs ,  has gary ever been shot at for real ?  
yes .  once .  yeah ,  a little .  he kinda did it to himself .  it &apos;s not really a good story .  
i wonder how i would react under fire ,  y &apos;know ?  and not backfire but - but heavy fire ,  like i was in a war or something .  
man ,  i would be great in a war !  i mean ,  i really ,  i think i would make a fantastic military leader .  i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys .  
before or after you were shot by your own troops ?  
i know where joey would be .  he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us .  
yes ,  if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .  
yeah ,  hero sandwiches .   
 would you like some more coffee ,  baby - doll ?  
i &apos;m fine ,  thanks .  
 yeah ,  see ,  i can &apos;t pull of baby - doll can i ?  
no .  i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident .  i &apos;m gonna get some tea .  
okay .   
hiya doin &apos; pumpkin ?  
nope .    
i know ,  really well .  in fact ,  i &apos;m gonna ask phoebe to move in with me .  
what do you ,  what do you think ?  
tonight ,  but don &apos;t say anything .  okay ?  
 i &apos;ll see you after work sweetie .   
okay .  bye !   
so ,  what movie should we see ?  
 gary &apos;s gonna ask you to move in with him !  !  
what ?  !  really ?  !  
he just told me at the counter .  he made me promise not to tell ,  but i couldn &apos;t hold it in any longer !  
i can &apos;t believe this !  
 right ,  because it &apos;s fast .  because ,  it &apos;s so fast .  it &apos;s fast !  
relax !  it &apos;s phoebe !  not you !  
oh !  good for you pheebs ,  way to go !   
no ,  but it is fast .  isn &apos;t it ?  
ohhhh !  
no ,  i like him a lot but i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready for this !  
so ,  what are you gonna do ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i &apos;ll just handle iti &apos;ll ask you to talk to him !  
me ?  !  why me ?  
because you are so afraid of commitment !  you talk to him ,  make him scared like you !  make him a man !  
i &apos;ll try ,  but i &apos;m not sure what good it would do ,  y &apos;know ?  because i &apos;m a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be .  
that is so sweet !   
hey ross ,  is uh ,  is staten island really an island ?  
uh - huh ,  that &apos;s why they call it staten island .  
ohhh .  i thought it was like long island .  
 also an island .   
hey ,  what time is it ?  
 .  
wow !  you realize that we &apos;ve been throwing this ball ,  without dropping it ,  for like an hour ?  
are you serious ?  !  
yeah .  i realized it about a half - hour ago but i didn &apos;t want to say anything  &apos;cause i didn &apos;t want to jinx it .  
wow !  we are pretty good at this !  hey !  we totally forgot about lunch !  
oh ,  i - i ,  i think that &apos;s the first time i ever missed a meal !   yeah ,  my pants are a little loose !  
 hey ,  you guys 
hey !  
is monica here ?  
all right listen umm ,  i just bought something i &apos;m not sure she &apos;s gonna like it ,  and it &apos;s gonna seem a little crazy ,  but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl .  
you bought shawn cassidy !  
noo !  i wish !  okay ,  you ready ?  
okay !   check it out !   
what - what is it ?  !  
what the hell is that ?  !  !  
it &apos;s a ,  it &apos;s a cat !  
that ,  is not a cat !  {i have to agree with joey on this one . } 
yes it is !  
why is it inside out ?  !  
excuse me !  but this is a purebred ,  show - quality sphinx cat !  
how much did you pay for that ?  
well ,  it was a little extravagant ,  but i a pretty good deal .  
yeah ?  how much ?  
a thousand bucks .  
on a cat ?  ?  !  !  !  !  
it &apos;s not a cat !  
all right listen ball boys !  my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing !  i mean it was so cute ,  it would sit in my lap and purr all day long ,  and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it !  
free cats do that too ,  y &apos;know .  {which reminds me ,  if i might get a little political here ,  support your local animal shelter .  pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from ,  you get a much better deal from the shelter ,  plus they probably won &apos;t die on you in a week and a half .  if you want a leash ,  go to the pet shop .  if you want the dog for that leash ,  go to the shelter and save it &apos;s life .  now back to regularly scheduled programming . } 
it &apos;s not a cat !  
ugh !  look you guys ,  i &apos;m really excited about this !  okay ?  i don &apos;t care what you think !  i &apos;m gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs .  whiskerson .   well ,  what am i gonna call her ?  fluffy ?  !   
 hey ,  you wanna get something to eat or uh ,  do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth ?  huh ?  
uhh ,  the ball thing .  
yeah ?  
hey ross ,  wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it ?  !  
uhh ,  yeah it would !  let &apos;s do it !  
okay !   
 uh - oh .  
what ?  
i have to pee .  and rachel &apos;s in the bathroom !   
man ,  i didn &apos;t think we were gonna make it !  
hey chandler ,  what are you doing here ?  
yeah ?  
 what &apos;s up ?  
sure .  okay .  
yeah ,  i - i considered that .  i just know it would make me happy .  
no ,  i mean happy .  
chandler ,  what - what are you doing ?  
i know !  i can &apos;t wait !  
listen chandler ,  the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love .  i justi wanna be around her as much as i can .  
so you know what i &apos;m talking about ,  right ?  
no ,  it &apos;s too soon for you guys .  
now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws !  how did it get there ?  !  {y &apos;know ,  sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up .  but it won &apos;t work .  i &apos;ll always have the last laugh !  <manical_laugh . wav> okay ,  so maybe i &apos;m a little deluded ,  it &apos;s probably just my spellchecker .  but ,  i must admit i did get mesozoic and paleozoic on the first attempt .  yay me !  anyhoo } 
maybe this should be more of a quiet game .  {oh ,  all right !  geez ,  i can &apos;t have any fun ! } 
 hey guys !  
hi !  
joey ,  i left my watch on the counter last night .   it was right here ,  where is it ?

all right ,  come on ,  i &apos;m - i &apos;m late for work !  
how do you know ?  you don &apos;t have a watch .  
guys ,  could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it !  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know  .  yeah ,  can &apos;t do it .   
what ?  !  
monica ,  whatever you do ,  do not drop that ball !  
yeah ,  we haven &apos;t dropped it in  
2 hours ,  27 minutes .

the strange part was ,  he was really nice ,  umm and he looks great ,  but i didn &apos;t feel anything at all !

naked alone time .  
no !  phoebe just because i &apos;m alone doesnt mean i wanna walk around naked .  i mean ,  you live alone ,  you don &apos;t walk around naked .

ross ,  youre being ridiculous !  okay ?  you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces !  
oh yeah ?  have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times ?  
yknow thats really fair .  yknow ?  most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60 .  ross ,  nobody cares about this except you !  this - this embarrassment thing is all in your head !  here ,  ill show you !  come here .

wow that was my scariest voice !  youre very brave .   
hey !  
hey .  
ugh ,  the worse day !  yknow ,  you think youre making progress at work and then your boss calls you raquel .  
hey listen ,  for the first four years of my work everybody called me sha - la - lap .   seriously .  
i believe you .  so ,  it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me raquel !  by the end of the day ,  the mailroom guys were calling me rocky !  
well ,  i - i still think youre very - very nice and very pretty 
what ?

rach 
yeah ,  hes gonna work on that .  
ohh !  this is so exciting !  oh god  come and knock on my door 
once you know the stories ,  its not that bad .  first marriage ,  wifes hidden sexuality ,  not my fault .  second marriage ,  said the wrong name at the altar ,  a little my fault .  third marriage ,  well they really shouldnt allow you to get married when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face ,  nevadas fault .  
well the divorces dont bother me ,  id date him .  but ,  not while hes still married .  
actually ,  im dating at all anymore .  see ,  i figured out that i was only dating guys that were like yknow bad for me ,  so until i work that out 
well ,  i dont care about the divorces either ,  but i wouldnt date him .  its just that hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl .  
what ?  !  
 she said ,   &quot; hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl .  &quot;   
this is crazy !  i mean ,  yes - yes rachel is my good friend and i - i have loved her in the past ,  but now ,  she is just my wife !  phoebe ,  will you - will you help me out here ?  
well ,  i thought you loved her when you - when you married her .  
we were drunk !  i wouldve married uh ,  joey with that amount of alcohol !  
hey !  you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani !  !  
 look ,  im sorry ,  but you guys are wrong .  i just dont want to be divorced three times .  
yes ,  and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her .  i must say ,   &quot; well done !  &quot;  bravo meg .  
okay ,  when are we gonna tell rachel what is actually gonna happen ?  
soon !  i - i just couldnt before .  you saw how upset joey got !  i couldnt do that to her ,  shes my best friend !  
well ,  joeys my best friend .  
im not your best friend ?  
you just said of course youre my best friend .  would you please tell rachel though ?  
all right ,  all right ,  at least im prepared .  
okay .   oh yes .   
 hey !  
hey - hey !

 hey roomie !  
okay ,  bye !   
rach ,  theres something uh ,  important i have to tell you .  
 are you pregnant ?  !  
no !  but ,  im throwing this shirt away !  i think there was a little misunderstanding before .  
um - hmm .  
umm ,  when i said that uh ,  that chandler and i wanted to umm ,  live together we meant alone together .  
 oh my god !  oh ,  thats funny ,  i cant believe i did that .  
oh no sweetie ,  no !  this is my fault ,  i wasnt clear !  im really sorry .  and listen ,  you take as much time as you need to move out okay ?  theres absolutely no rush .  
okay .   
okay .  dont you want a cookie ?  
sure ?   thanks .  
maybe ,  do you need a tissue ?   
monica ,  where did you get these ?  !  
i made them !  
god ,  its gonna so weird like when i come home and youre not here .  yknow ?  no more joey and chans .  no more j and cs .   &quot; you wanna go over to joey and chandlers ?  &quot;   &quot; cant ,  its not there .  &quot;  
look ,  im just gonna be across the hall ,  we can still do all the same stuff .  
yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future .  
not once did we do that .  
 hi .  
hey !  
hi .  
so i ,  i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us .  
oh yeah ?  well ,  howd she take it ?  
really well .  yeah .  surprisingly well .  yeah ,  she didnt cry .  she wasnt angry or sad .   
and youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry ?  
i mean ,  all im asking for is just a little emotion !  is that too much to ask after six years ?  !  i mean what ?  are - are - are rachel and i not as close as you guys ?  !  i mean do we not have as much fun ?  !  dont i deserve a few tears ?  !  !  i mean we - we told joey ,  he cried his eyes out !  
hey !  i did not cry my eyes out !  !  come on !  its like the end of an era !  no more j - man and channies !  !  
you got married again .  
so thats your second marriage in two years .  
ross ,  i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client .  why dont you tell me what happened .  
 im sorry ,  is this the same rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage ?  
oh ,  thats better then .  
i see .  have you considered therapy ?  
there are a couple of forms to fill out .  
and well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh ,  sound mind .  
and well need you and rachel to testify before a judge .  
of course you did .  look ross ,  you cant get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there .  
hey !  
hey .  so um ,  i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff .  
okay !  
yknow ,  no point in dragging it out .  dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore .  
okay .  
hey rach ,  what about this ?   huh ?  who - who gets this ?  see ,  i dont know if i want it because it might be yknow ,  too many memories !  
 what the hell is that ?  
i dont know .   hey ,  rachel ,  you want the big plate ?  i want you to have the big plate .  
wow !  mon ,  thanks !  i love this plate !  
something to remember me by !  
mon ,  honey youre not dying .  im just moving out .  yknow ,  i mean were gonna see each other all the time .  
but still ,  its a big change .  the end of an era ,  you might say !  
are you okay ?  youre not blinking .  
im fine !  i just ,  im thinking how much its an end of era .  
oh ,  all right .  but yknow i gotta say ,  i dont ,  i dont think six years counts as an era .  
an era is defined as a significant period of time .  now ,  it was significant to me ,  maybe it wasnt significant to you !  
what is the matter with you ?  !  
what is the matter with you ?  !  !  why arent you more upset ?  !  arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore ?  !  i mean arent you gonna miss me at all ?  !  
all right ,  fine ,  but dont get mad at me .  its - its just a little hard to believe .  
whats hard to believe ?  
well yknow ,  its you guys .  you - you do this kind of stuff !  yknow ?  i mean ,  you - you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out !  i guess im not upset because i dont see you guys going through with it .  im sorry .  
rachel ,  its going to happen .  chandler is gonna move in here .  
but i 
no - no ,  wait !  just let me finish ,  okay ?  this isnt something that we just ,  we just impulsively decided in - in vegas ,  this is something we both really want .  and it is going to happen .  
it is ?  really ?  
yeah ,  sweetie .  
 i mean were not ,  were not gonna live together anymore ?  
no .  
what ?  oh my god !  im gonna miss you so much !   
im gonna miss you !   
i mean its the end of an era !  
 okay ,  bye !  
oh no .  
so ?  did you get the annulment ?  
i couldnt .  
i knew it !  because you love rachel .  
its not that .  okay ?  annulments are more complicated than i 
yeah ,  complicated cause of the love .  
i i do ,  i do not love rachel .  im gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible .  okay ?  would i do that if i loved her ?  
ive never been more convinced of your love for her .  
i do not have feelings for rachel !  okay ?  !    
ohh ,  whats wrong ?  !  
monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing .  
oh mycome here !  come here !   its okay .  everythings gonna be okay .  
thank you .  
so ,  ross and rachel got married ,  monica and chandler almost got married ,  do you think you and i should hook up ?  
oh we do ,  but not just yet .  
really ?  !  well ,  when ?  
okay umm ,  well ,  first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way .  yeah .  but it wont work out .  
wow .  
i know .  then ,  im gonna marry chandler for the money and youll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids .  
great !  
but then we ditch those two and thats when we get married .  well have chandlers money and rachels kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachels drinking problem .  
oh - oh ,  what about ross ?  
 hey !  
hey !  check it out !  this is unbelievable !  joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes !   
 dude !  what are yoyou trying to kill me ?  !  
 pheebs ,  i wanna ask you something .  
uh - huh ,  what ?  
well since im movin out and - and youre so beautiful 
oh !  
how about i move in with you ?  
well ,  that would be great but then what do we do about denise ?  
whos denise ?  
my roommate .  
you have a roommate ?  !  
yes ,  denise .  denise !  
hey ,  what is with the secrecy phoebe ?  huh ?  and what about this denise ,  is she cute ?  
pheebs ,  i dont understand .  how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about ?  
maybe because you never listen to anything that i say .  i talk about her all the time !  denise !  !  !  !  !  
hey rach ,  listen i was thinkin uh ,  im gonna have an extra room over at my place 
oh ,  thats true .  
yeah ,  why dont you move in with me ?  itll be great !  we could stay up late ,  watch movies ,  and you know about naked thursdays right ?  
yeah ,  yeah i think im gonna find my own place .  
hey .  
hey !  
so ,  what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?  
oh ,  that .  umm ,  she took it really well .  
you didnt tell her did you ?  
no .  
of course not ,  because youre in love with her .  
i am not in love with her .  she was very upset about having to move out so i eh ,  didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset .  i - i just comforted her ,  as a friend .  
what do you mean ,  comforted her ?  
its nothing ,  i just gave her a hug .  
ah - ha !  a classic sign of love ,  the hug !  
its also a sign of friendship .  
yeah ,  not in your case lovey loverson .   
 it was a hug !  
okay ,  just tell me this ,  did you or did you not smell her hair ?  
s - s - smell her hair ?  what if i did ?  
ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head !  thats why ,  thats why women are shorter .  so that men will fall in love when they hug them !   oh come on ross ,  youre a scientist .  
i was hugging her as a friend .  its not my fault her - her hair got in my face ,  shes got a lot of it and it smells all - all uh coconutty .   what ?  !  oh ,  that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel !  maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts !  
 okay ,  whatever you say .  but just be careful ,  all right ?  rachels not in the same place you are .  
 if the place you are referring too is being in love ,  then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place !  
hey !   dude ,  some guy just called for you .  
who was it ?  
i dont know !  how about ,   &quot; thanks for taking the message .  &quot;  jeez !   
okay listen ,  yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty ,  you wanna talk about what we want to do with it ?  
sure !  
okay ,  i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room ,  right ?  with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time !  and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here !  !  okay ,  whatever ,  i really havent thought about it that much .  
well ,  i like that idea .  obviously !  i was thinking maybe - maybe - maybe it could be a game room ,  yknow ?  i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh ,  like space invaders and asteroids for $200 ,  the real ones !  the big - big ones !  
no .  
okay so you mean no as in ,   &quot; gee chandler ,  what an interesting idea .  lets discuss it before we reject it completely .  &quot;  
oh ,  im sorry .  of course i mean that .  interesting idea ,  umm ,  talk about it ,  but no .  
so ,  thats it ?  
i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room .  the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques .  
which is why asteroids is perfect !  its the oldest game !  
what do you have against the beautiful guest room ?  
i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room ,  especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away !  
are you mocking me ?  
hey ,  whats up ?  
nothing ,  monica and i had a stupid fight .  
but youre still moving in together ,  right ?  because my ad came out today .   
  &quot; wanted .  female roommate ,  non - smoker ,  non - ugly .  &quot;  nice !

youre just staring into space .  
umm ,  im trying to move that pencil .

really ?  
yeah !  oh yes !  
ohh .  
listen ,  we dont have to make that a guest room ,  we can think of something to do with the room together .  
thats a great idea !  we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room .  
totally !   
we dont have to come up with this now .  
oh good .  
hey ,  yknow what ?  why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room ?  
changes ?  
yeah ,  i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair .   
youre - youre - youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here ?  
is that a problem ?  
well ,  its a set and they should probably stay together .  
oh ,  thats cool .  then ill just bring them both over .  
see now - now youre taking them away from their home .  
okay ,  i get it .  so ,  i get nothing !  nothing here is mine !  everything here is yours !  ill get up in the morning put on your clothes ,  and head off to work !  
yeah - yeah ,  yknow what ?  yeah ,  thats it - thats it ,  everything will be mine !  nothing will be yours !  thats - thats what i said !  oh come on ,  chandler !  im talking about the barca lounger !  it just ,  it doesnt match !  where is it gonna go ?  !  
in the game room !  
look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly !  
 everything on your application looks really goodohh !  just one last question umm ,  are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out ?  
whoa !  !  now look ,  dont be just blurtin stuff out .  i want you to really think about your answers .  okay ?  
 you can call off the roommate search !   hi !  ill be living here .   
oh dont listen to him ,  hes just some guy who really wants the apartment ,  but i dont think hes gonna get it .  
why did you take the shower curtain down ?  
hey !  
hey !  oh listen ,  i was just clearing some space for your stuff .  
oh thanks ,  but listen ,  i was just at monicas and she and chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in .  
what do you mean ,  theyre not moving in ?  they - theyre still moving in right ?  
no - no ,  they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room .  
what ?  !  over a stupid room !  
yeah ,  i feel kinda bad for them ,  but im also really psyched cause i dont have to move in here !  
whats all this about you guys fighting ?  !  is this really over a room ?  !  i mean ,  that is so silly !  
ross ,  we can handle this .  
well ,  apparently not ,  and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly .  i mean ,  enough of the silliness !  
well ,  why dont you tell her to stop being silly !   
 okay - okay !  two very good points ,  look ive known you both a long time ,  and ive never seen either of you one / millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together .  do you really want to throw that all away over a room ?  that is so silly .  now wh - what is more important ,  love or silliness ?  
well ,  we are fond of the silliness ,  but we also have a soft spot for the love .  
love is the best medicine .  
thats laughter .  
why do you do it ?  
i dont know .  
okay !  all right !  now ,  chandler you - you wanna live with monica ,  right ?  
yeah ,  i do .  
and mon ,  you wanna live with chandler ,  dont ya ?  
yes .  
so i understand youre looking for a place .  
oh ,  i was going to offer you my apartment .  
i dont know .  
 hey rach !  
hi !  
youre never gonna believe it uh ,  monica and chandler are moving in again .  thats great news righti mean for them .  right ?  
oh wow .  
yeah but ,  on the bright side ,  we get to be roommates again .  
yeah .  yknow umm ,  uh ,  umm ,  about that ,  umm ,  ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything ,  but dont you think its gonna be weird ?  
wh - why ?  !  why - why - why would it ,  why would it be weird ?  
well ,  because of us !  because of our history .  
no !  
no ?  
no !  no !  it would be weird if we were still in that place ,  i mean are you still in that place ?  
no !  not at all !  
good !  me neither !  so its not a problem .  were just two friends who happen to be roommates .  
okay ,  but ross ,  eventually you and i are gonna be dating .  
really ?  !  we are ?  
yeah !  im gonna have a boyfriend ,  youre gonna have a girlfriend 
ohh !  that would be great .  
but yknow what ,  if you think its gonna be okay well just work out a system .  yknow ,  itll be like college ,  ill hang a hanger on the door and put a sign ,   &quot; come back later ,  im gettin lucky .  &quot;   
so are you sure about this whole moving in thing ?  !  i mean its a really big step !  and - and whats the rush ?  !   
thats very funny !  
hes being silly ,  because he knows that we enjoy the silliness !  
no ,  i - i - im serious ,  okay ?  i mean ,  think about it .  you move in ,  you start fighting over stupid game rooms ,  next thing yknow you break up !  
ross ,  you were right before ,  it was just a stupid fight about a room .  
okay ,  there are no stupid fights !  !  this isnt about the room ,  this is about what the room represents !  and unfortunately ,  this room  could destroy you !  !  
yeah ,  i &apos;m not so worried .  
yeah ,  no ,  me neither .  
fine !  its your life !   i just dont want to see you guys break up !  which you will do if you move in together ,   but thats what you want ,  theres nothing i can do .   dont do it !  !  !  !  !   
you still want to move in together right ?  
of course !  
ross didnt scare you ?  
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him .  
come here ,  i want to show you something !  
okay !   ,  the coffee table forward  ,  and taped a square outline on the floor . ) 
oh my god !  someones killed square man !

okay !  
yknow those big - big uh ,  road signs that say  &quot; merge ?  &quot;

  &quot; there are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate .  each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct  &quot;  
oh ,  this is it .  this whats gonna kill me .  
  &quot;  subcategories .  the first of these subcategories is  &quot;  
 uh ross !  are there uh ,  are there naked chicks on that piece of paper ?  
no !  why ?  
well ,  ive just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didnt have naked chicks on it .  
ohh !  okay !  okay .    &quot; there are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate .   each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into  &quot;  
why dont you open with a joke ?  
open with a joke ?  its a university ,  not a comedy club !  
wait a minute ,  hold the phone !  youre not talking about chuckles university ?  !

hey !  
 hey !  so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and ill have my health insurance back in no time .  
thats great ,  but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now ?

whats wrong with you ?  
nothing !  well ,  i - i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before ,  then i uh passed out and uh ,  havent been able to stand up since .  but um ,  i dont think its anything serious .  
this sounds like a hernia .  you have toyou - you go to the doctor !  
no way !  kay look ,  if i have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach !   
thats a hernia .  
well ,  were a little early ,  the lecture doesnt end for 15 minutes .  
yeah ,  but yknow we could sneak in and watch .  
yeah ,  we could .  oh hey look !  theres some kappa kappa deltas !  i was a kappa .   hey sisters !   wow ,  we really are bitches .   
what the hell are you doing ?  !  
look ,  i was nervous !  you guys had me all worried i was going to be boring !  i got up there and they were all like staring at me .  i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out .  
yeah ,  and not a very good one .  
will you - will you please ?   paleontology department here .  
oh .  
 im sorry ,  ive got plans with my sister .  
 monica gellerrr .

 oh ,  you can have an accent and i cant ?  !   top o the morning to ya laddies !  
just please stop !   
hey ,  will you grab me a cruller ?   sit down !  will you go to the hospital ?  !  
dude !  hernia operations cost like ,  a lot probably .  besides its getting darker and more painful ,  that means its healing .  
i will loan you the money .  just go to the hospital and lets just get that thing pushed back in .  
thank you ,  but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i dont want that hanging over my head .  okay ?  besides ,  as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want !  yeah ,  im thinking ill probably start with that laser eye surgery too .   
hey !  
hey .  
hey !  
whats going on ?  
oh joeys got a really bad hernia ,  but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix !  
look ,  im telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesnt hurt that bad .  
hey !  maybe youll die !

you just wanna each take one ?  
yeah that seems fair .  we never use them .  
 look ,  i really need some help ,  okay ?  why ?  why did i have to speak in a british accent ?  !  what do i do ?  
well 
why dont you phase it out ?  yeah ,  fade the accent out and people will think youre ,  yknow ,  that youre adjusting to life in america .  
yeah ,  i mean ,  come on ross ,  no one will even notice .  i mean theyre probably not even listening !  
theyre not listening too me ?  
of course theyre listening to you !  everybody listens to you .  
monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing ?  
 okay .   &quot; hey ,  timmy ,  ive got a surprise for you .  &quot;  if you could play it a little less intense ?  
so thats why i feed my dog purina one !  pick up a bag today !

okay !    &quot; hello ross ,  this is dr .  mcneeley from the fake accent university ,  wed like you to come on board with us full time !   
 hey !  
hey !

really ?  !  how do you know ?  
because my psychic is dead !  she mustve read the cards wrong !  
oh ,  im sorry .

 thank you .  
but are you sure you can do this ?  
yeah !  and hey ,  thanks for coming with me .  and thanks again for helping me take a shower .

uh sure .  
action !  
cut !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !    
 hello ,  is ross there ?  
yes ,  this russell ,  rosss divorce lawyer ,  just tell him that since i havent heard from him ,  i assume hes decided to give the marriage a try .  
 all right ,  keep going .  we are phasing the accent out ,  phasing it out .  so without out re - testing the results in the laboratory  the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis  .  were there any questions at this point ?   yes .   
 come again ?  whats - whats this nonsense ?    all right ,  im - im not english .  im from long island .  i was really nervous and the accent just uh ,  just came out .  im sorry .  so ,  if we could just get back to the lecture .  umm ,  were there any questions ?   about paleontology .   all right ,  look i was just trying to make a good first impression .  obviously ,  i screwed up .  but what you guys think of me is really important because im - im hoping to get a permanent job here .  so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression  
ross !  !  are you crazy ?  !  i am still your wife !  !  what ,  were you just never gonna tell me ?  !  !  what the hell is wrong with you ?  !  !  !  !  ugh ,  i could just kill you !  !  !  !  
have you really done this before ?  
yeah !  yeah !  yeah !  you just take a big ,  big swing .  now ,  dont hold back .   and phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as chandler and monica enter . ) 
hey !  
hey - hey - hey !  
what are you doing ?  
were just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back .  
i cannot believe that you didnt tell me that we are still married !  !  
look i was going to tell you !  
when ?  !  after the birth of our first secret child ?  !   ross didnt get the annulment; we are still married .  
what ?  
youre kidding !  
 oh my god !  !  
ross !  
okay ,  maybe it wasnt my best decision .  but i just couldnt face another failed marriage .  
okay ,  let me just jump in and ask ,  at what point did you think this was a successful marriage ?  
rach ,  come on ,  if you think about it ,  its actually kinda funny .   okay ,  maybe its best not to think about it .  
okay ,  this is inexcusable .  i am shocked to my very core !  
phoebe ,  i told her you already knew .  
another lie .  you have a sickness !  
yeah ,  thats what i drive .  i make four bucks an hour ,  i saved up for 350 years !  
na - uh !   hey did anybody lose their keys ?  
joey ,  why dont you put them in the lost and found ?  
theres a lost and found ?   my shoe !   
you left a shoe here ?  !  
well ,  i didnt realize until i got home .  i wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe !  yknow what ?  im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield .   
oh good ,  when he comes back for his keys ,  ill be sure to give him your shoe .  
great !  thanks .   
 oh ,  good ,  good ,  you guys are here !  listen ,  how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies ?  !  
oh my god ,  what a fun day !  that sounds great !  
 yeah ,  all right .  
okay ,  well ill bring them by tomorrow morning .  okay ,  and uh ,  by the way ,  theyre not actually puppies ,  theyre frank and alices triplets .  okay ,  see ya !   
whoa - whoa - whoa !  what ?  
 please !  please !  please !  please !  oh please !  please !  please !  frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and im nervous cause ive never done that before by myself !  
dont worry about it phoebe ,  well absolutely do it .  
yeah ,  im gonna pass .  cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies .  
 i love your car .  
i bet its fast .  
yeah !  
so ,  i still have boxes here .  i still have boxes at rosss ,  and i have nowhere to live !  wow .  i could so easily freak out right now .  
what about me ?  i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while ,  i dont have a roommate .  
well ,  maybe - maybe i could be your roommate pheebs .  
maybe you could be my roommate !  
well theres an idea !  !  
yeah !  
that would be great !  wait ,  how long is denise gone for ?  
umm ,  she said shed be back december 26th .  
december 26th ,  huh maybe shes santa clause .   
 oh look who it is ,  my husband .  the apple of my eye .  
okay ,  i got us a court date for tomorrow at and i picked up all the forms .  ill take care of everything .  
well sure ,  if you say youre gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you .  give me those forms !   all right ,  now im gonna do this my way and i dont want to hear a peep out of you !  
okay rach ,  but 
op !  youre peeping !   
ross !  yknow what ,  i just gotwhy ?  why did you do this ?  !  
look i told you 
i dont wanna hear  &quot; three failed marriages !  &quot;  
look ,  if youd had two failed marriages ,  youd understand !  
well ,  yknow what ?  thanks to you im half way there !  ugh !  oh !  i am so mad !  ross ,  i dont think i have ever been this angry !  
what about the time i said we were on a break ?  
pheebs ,  hows it going ?  
 im doing okay .  i think its going well .  do you think theyre having fun ?  am i talking to fast ?  
nope ,  sound like me .  pheebs ,  its going great .  look at chandler with little baby girl chandler .  
little baby girl chandler ,  where i have heard that before ?  oh right ,  coach ruben .   do you know what pheebs ?  when youre done over there ,  we kinda have a situation over here too .   
na - uh ,  no ,  we are all responsible for our own babies .  
see thats where i think that youre wrong .  weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense .  
what do you mean ?  
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone .  phoebe ,  you can be in charge of wiping .  and yknow mon ,  you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around  
that sounds really great ,  but maybe you should be in charge of wiping .  
okay ,  im a rookie .  i should not be in the end zone .  chandler adds the powder ,  begrudgingly ,  and monica puts the diaper on . ] 
this is so great !  this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant .  
yeah ?   well this is not what i ordered .  
 hey guys !  
hey !  
hey !  
hey babies !  oh ,  im having the best morning .  that uh ,  that porsche ive got the keys too ,  still there !  
shocking !  since you still have the keys .  
you should see the treatment i get when im with that car !  people are friendly; they - they wanna talk ,  and not just about the car !  one guy gave me advice about my equity investments .  
what equity investments ?  
the ones that got me the porsche !  will you keep up !   but i figured ,  if - if people keep seeing me just standing there ,  theyre gonna start to think that i dont own it .  so i figured ill wash it .  right ?  monica ,  you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow ?  
oh yeah ,  i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound .  
you dont even have a car !  
i know .  but umm ,  one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building ,  so i washed it .  
and ?  
and six others .  
yeah ,  she tops out at 130 .  
and thats just in the city .  i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate .  
sure !  
okay ,  take it easy .  
really ?  oh uh ,  oh just give me five more minutes with it .  
oh i - i uh ,  found the keys and now im just polishing her up .  
yeah ,  but its my wax .  dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater ,  but could i have my keys .  
sure .  here .   ill uh ,  save your parking spot .  
why not ?  
i dont know why i was so nervous about this .  and i dont know why frank and alice are always complaining .  this is so easy .  
yeah ,  two hours ,  a lifetime thats the same .  
 check it out !  check it out !  when the babies wake up ,  they can meet krog !   
chandler ,  what are you doing ?  that thing can put someones eye out !  
he can do more than that !  he can destroy the universe !  
no chandler ,  they can swallow one of those little parts !  and also ,  look at his smooth area ,  thats just gonna mess them up .  
theyre not gonna swallow anything ,  you guys are being way over protective .  when i was a kid ,  my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass !  
what ?  !  
glass ,  sand ,  whatever .   
oh ,  look at little leslie stretching in her sleep .  
oh its so cute .  i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head .  
oh ,  i can still do that .  
how are you still single ?  !  
 all right .   i thought about it and maybe youre right .  maybe krog is not a safe toy .  
good .  what made you change your mind ?  
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun .  
how did that happen ?  !  !  
well ,  i was trying to prove that i was right .  yknow ?  and it turns out i was wrong .  and now its lodged in my throat .   
okay you two are asking the court for an annulment ?  
so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr . _geller is mentally unstable .  
and based on the fact that mr . _geller is intravenous drug user .  
what ?  !  
uh yes ,  heroin and crack .  
crack isnt even an intravenous drug !  
now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage ?  
oh ,  come on !  
and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage .  well ,  that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin .  
that wont be necessary .  
and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies !  
now if you were two involved in a serious relationship ,  that really creates a problem .  
is there ,  anything in this record that is actually true ?  
well ,  based on what i heard ,  you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment .  if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce .  
 thats great !  are you happy now ?  look what you did with your funny ,  funny form !  
 what ?  !  me ?  !  what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense !  
and whatwhat are you typing that for ?  did you hear what she said ?  we dont get the annulment .  dont type that !  what ?  !  stop typing !   hey !  stop typing !   stop typing !  stop typing !  !  
you need to get out of my chambers .  
all right look lady here is the deal ,  i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one !  
would you like to spend the night in jail ?  
 so the porsche guy took his car back .  
but you found the keys to his clothes ?  
no .  no ,  i just uh ,  i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche .  
and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes ?  
of course !  only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car !  right ?  
that is true .  
yeah ,  but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun .  
oh ,  ive been there .  yeah ,  i am gonna go drive my porsche .   
joey ,  you know you dont actually have one .  
come on !  what are you doing ?  !  im in character !  would you talk to her !   
ahh ,  i think it just moved .  its really poking me .  
all right ,  thats it ,  were going to the emergency room .  
what ?  !  no ,  you cant ,  you cant leave me here with them !  were baby - sitting !  
the babies are asleep ,  im sure youll be okay on your own for a while !  
but you - you cant leave me with them !  we - were a team !  were playing a zone !  theyre gonna triple team me !  
hes got something plastic lodged in his throat ,  weve got to go to the hospital .  
but no ,  because a doctor wont be able to help him ,  its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years .  
i think thats gum .  
im pretty sure its gun .  
okay ,  listen this really hurts .  lets go .  
maybe because youve got the keys ?  
 porsche .   
this is totally your fault !  
my fault ?  !  you threatened the judge !  
well ,  you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine !  !  
that was the only way i could get him to stop typing !  
hi !  how are the gellers ?  
dont call us that !   
the judge wouldnt let us get an annulment !  now we gotta get a divorce !  !  did a porsch throw up on you ?   
me taking care of you is no problem ,  huh ?  you guys feel safe .  right ?  okay ,  im gonna take that spit bubble as ,   &quot; yeah ,  i do !  &quot;  okay ,  after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie ,  ill set you up with a clean one .   okay ,  im sorry .  i didnt mean to scare you .  i just have to clean that up .  okay ?  cause lets face it ,  were at monicas .   i broke it .  all right .  well ,  thats just the way that goes .   okay ,  good .   why are there only two of you ?  where is leslie ?  well ,  you cant answer .   leslie ?  where are you leslie ?  leslie ,  now would be a good time for your first words !   well ,  look at you !  hey !  you are a little bit mischievous !  my gosh !   oh ,  youre a lot mischievous !  well ,  itll dry .   okay ,  you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there !   monicas apartment looks like a tornado ,  a hurricane ,  a swarm of locusts ,  fire ,  brimstone ,  hail ,  and giant man - eating ,  radioactive ants have torn the place apart .  needless to say ,  its messy enough to cause monica to die of shock right away .  parents with small children know what im talking about . ] 
 hey !  
 how do you feel ?  
well ,  lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours .  
okay ,  so i totally took care of the babies all by myself !  i fed em ,  bathed em ,  and put em to bed .  
and protected them from a tornado ?   
oh my god .  
i know ,  the babies are asleep .  
phoebe ,  what ,  what happened here ?  !  
i did it !  i took care of the babies all by myself !  
but my apartment !  
was the setting of phoebes triumph .  
but the mess !  
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself .  
youre right ,  youre right i shouldnt freak out .  cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies !  when will that be ?  !  
 oh honey thank god youre home ,  i was getting worried .  
i picked up the divorce papers .  uh ,  ive already signed everything and i put little xs where you need to sign .  
oh ,  little xs !  great !  that makes up for everything !  
yknow ,  i - iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too !  okay ?  
oh ,  name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one !  
okay ,  how about you flew to london to stop my wedding !  ah ,  how about you told me you loved me after i was already married !  
hey !  wait a minute !  that was different !  i did those things because i was in love with you !  
yeah !  right !   
youre right .  thats very different .  so lets ,  lets just sign the papers .  all right ?   what ?  
nothing .   
okay ,  can we just sign please ?  
uh - hmm .   
congratulations .   
okay ross ,  werewait a minute .  umm ,  i uh ,  i kinda have a little confession .  
what ?  
well ,  yknow this whole marriage thing ,  kinda my idea .  
excuse me ?  
well ,  remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married ?  
yeah ?  
and uh ,  yeah ,  i didnt really ,  i didnt want to say anything ,  but it kinda it just ,  it kinda kept coming back to me ,  and umm ,  remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes .  and uh ,  and i thought it would be funnier if we got married .  so as a ,  as a compromise we decided first to get married ,  and then  to eat a lot of grapes .  so umm ,  sorry i got us into this mess .  
so then if - ifi mean if you think about it ,  this is all  your fault .  
yeah ,  dont push it though .  
ive got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women ,  never thought i would be divorcing you .  
i know .  i always thought if you and i got married ,  it would be the one that stuck .  and it wouldnt be a secret ,  and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut .   
did i ,  did i even treat ?  
no ,  it was on the house ,  it was ,  it was a newlywed special .  
that may be the most depressing thing ive heard in my life .  i should probably get these to my lawyers office .  
hey ,  thanks ross ,  for taking care of all of this .  
eh ,  no problem .   
im gonna need a copy of those .  
 hi joey .  
 he has the most amazing porsche under there !  
 okay !   listen ,  im gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent .  
right !  and when is that due ?  
first of the month .  
and thats every month ?  
no ,  just the months you actually want to live here .  
ahhh .  
okay ,  here is the phone bill .   
 oh my god !  !  
thats our phone number .  now look ,  i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing ,  so why dont i justwhy dont i just cover you for a while ?  
no - no !  no way !  joey tribbiani does not take charity anymore .  
its not charity ,  joe 
no !  forget it !  okayi mean thanks ,  but im done taking money from you .  all right ,  i can take of myself .  now ,  whats next ?  come on .  
okay uh ,  heres the electric bill .   
this is how much we pay for electric ?  !  !  !  
uh ,  yeah .   
so is joey going to have to give up the apartment ?  
no ,  i hope not !  i tried to offer him some money ,  but he wouldnt take it .  
well ,  how much do you think he needs ?  
i figure that $1 , 500 would cover him for a few months ,  yknow ?  but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride .  
why dont you hire him as an actor ?  you could have him dress up and put on little skits .  whatever you want .  
well that would help the pride thing .  
 hey !  
hey !  wow !  you look great !  wanna move in with me tomorrow ?  
 okay .  
okay !   so ,  what do you girls have planned for tonight ?  
well ,  instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with rachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that rachel is moving in with phoebe .

oh my god ,  phoebe ,  thats not ralph lauren .  thats kenny the copy guy .  
what ?  
oh .  . go .  . oh .  . and i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren .  if she finds out that i lied to her ,  she is going to hate me even more .  phoebe !  !  
why would the copy guy say he was ralph lauren ?  
to get you to make out with him !  !  !  
 okay ,  maybe this will make your teeth look less white .   nope .  okay ,  colors that dont work are blue ,  yellow ,  green ,  red ,  black ,  white ,  orange ,  and purple .  
i dont know what im going to do .  that date starts in like an hour .  
hey ross ,  maybe if your skin was lighter .  your teeth wouldnt look so bright .  
oh great .  so all i need to do is get some new skin .  thank you .  
im just saying ,  if we put just a little bit of makeup on you .  
whoa .  whoa .  whoa .  were not 13 anymore .  
ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working .  
but ,  wont she notice i have makeup on ?  
please .  half the guys out there have makeup on .  
what ?  ?  
all right ,  half the people .  i mean ,  just try it and see .  
no .  i am not putting on makeup .   
now are drawers will smell nice and we didnt waste these pantyhose .  
yes ,  god forbid we throw out old underwear .  you - you know what ?  im going to go over to joeys .  
wait ,  were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer .  
yes ,  but i feel like ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today .  you know .  in fact i think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple .  
you know what ?  this has been kind of a girlie day .  youre right ,  im sorry .  
nah ,  nah ,  its okay .  i feel like i need to be in guy place .  you know ,  do kind of like a man thing .  
yeah .  go over to joeys .  go over to joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall .  
you know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall ?  
hey chandler .  come on in .  were knitting pot holders .  
hi rachel .  
you didnt cancel the fabric order from taiwan ?  
thats not true ?  
oh thats interesting ?  because i checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you ,  rachel .  
listen to me .  if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job .  you are sadly mistaken .  
and after that ,  what could i do except become a chef .  
and someday soon ,  i hope to open my own restaurant .  
you know ,  youre a really great listener .  most guys i go out with ,  they just talk and talk .  
after a while its like ,  shut your mouth ,  you know ?  
ive probably been talking too much .  why dont we talk about you a little bit ?  
come on .  i want to know .  
so whats really neat .  if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan ,  your arrangement will look fresh much longer .  
oh my god ,  joey ,  that is such a great tip .  
monica ,  could you excuse us for a second ?  i need to talk to the girl with the flowers .  
okay .  oh but joey ,  come over later because im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter .  
ohh ,  i love birds .   
what is the matter with you  ?  !  ?  
what ?  
youre arranging flowers !   you got dead flowers !  you got a picture ,  a picture ,  of a baby dressed like flowers !  this is not joey !  !  
hey .  hey look i am still joey ,  okay .  flowers theyre just ,  you know ,  theyre nice to look at .  and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist .  of a famous baby .  
youre turning into a women .  
no im not .  why would you say that ?  thats just mean .  
now ive upset you ?  what did i say ?  
now ,  she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job .  
but why didnt you just tell her the truth .  
i did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren .  
well ,  hey ,  what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company ?  you know .  what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man ?  huh ,  did she ever think of that ?  
you were with kenny today ,  werent you ?  
just for a second .  
ohh ,  phoebe ,  what am i going to do ?  
well ,  the only thing you can do .  sleep with ralph lauren .  
im not going to sleep with ralph lauren .  i mean ,  i could ,  but i wouldnt .  
ohh ,  sleep with kenny .  
that wouldnt help me .  
ive had a really good time tonight .  
you know ,  i rarely connect with someone this much on the first date .  
are you going to eat that bread ?  
 you make me laugh .  
would you like to move over to the couch ?  
maybe ill just turn the lights down a little .  
okay .   
are those your teeth ?  ?  
yes .  theyre insanely white .  
whats a matter with you ?  
hi rachel .  ohh ,  ive been meaning to ask you .  have you seen the new ralph lauren sheets ?  ohh ,  what am i thinking .  of course you have .  
oh ,  really ?  
oh my god .  he just gave you the coldest look i have ever seen .  its like he hates you .  then it is true .  
ohh honey come here .   ohh it will be ok .  weve all been there .  
hey .  
whats the matter ?  are you upset ?  
well ,  if thats what you want .  ill just put it all in my room .  
okay .  
sure .  
 okay ,  great !  bye .   so guess whos coming to thanksgiving dinner ?  
sydney portier ?  hehheh .   
 i miss rachel .   no ,  my parents .  
oh !  thats great ,  they havent seen the place since i moved in !   
yeah ,  and yknow ,  if you could not mention to them that we live together ,  that would be great !   ,  i was thinking we would eat around four .   
 why cant i tell them that we live together ?  
because they dont know were dating .   do you think we should eat in the kitchen ?   
why havent you told them ?  !  
um ,  well ,  i was going to ,  i - i - i really was .  but um ,  then somewhere ,  just out of nowhere ,  i didnt .  
why havent you told them ?  !  wouldnt they be happy ?  !  
 so !  dinner in the kitchen around four !  ill see you then .   
why wouldnt they be happy ?  
well ,  um ,  because mainly ,  um ,  they dont like you .  im sorry .  
what ?  what ?  why ?  !  
maybe because you used to be aloof ,  or that youre really sarcastic ,  or that ,  yknow ,  you joke around all the time .  or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch .  
is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me ?  
look ,  i know that i shouldve told them .  i know i shouldnt care what they think .  im sorry .  
yknow ,  itll be okay .  itll be okay .  because when they come over ,  i will be all charming ,  i will make them fall in love with me ,  and then well tell em .  
you really think thatll work ?  
hey ,  i can be pretty charming ,  babe ,  i won you over ,  didnt i ?  
hey !   oh ,  good ,  ross !  youre parents like me ,  right ?   
 yes ,  of course they like you !  
well monica just told me that they dont .  
 yeah ,  they dont like you .  
 do you know why ?  
i dunno ,  maybe its because youre really sarcastic .  or maybe its cause you uh -  
 well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess !   
this is great ,  another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for .  
maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin up ,  eh ?  
maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment .

your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me !

 youre alone .  
no ,  i - i live with phoebe .  i mean youre  alone ,  alone .  and i just - its just not the time for us .  im sorry .  
 ah well ,  cant blame a guy for trying !   
oh and  okay ,  and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it ,  i learned something in acting class ,  try uh ,  rubbing your stomach  or uh ,  or saying mmm and uh ,  oh oh !  and smiling  ,  okay ?  
yeah ,  im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore .   
rachel ,  there you are !  come on ,  lets serve that dessert already !  
joey ,  youre gonna have to stop rushing me ,  you know what ?  you dont get any dessert .  
 really ?  
no ,  im just kidding i would never do that to you !  okay ,  everybody ,  its trifle time !  
so ,  now ,  rach ,  this is a traditional english trifle ,  isnt it ?

whats not to like ?  custard ?  good .  jam ?  good .  meat ?  gooooood .   
 .  .  . so a bird just grabbed it ,  and then tried to fly away with it and ,  and then just dropped it on the street ?   
 yes ,  but if its any consolation ,  before the bird dropped it ,  he seemed to enjoy it .   
rachel ,  come here .   okay ,  i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap ,  and i had another dream about jack .  
oh ,  phoebe ,  do i wanna hear this ?  
i dunno ,  lets see !  so ,  okay ,  i dreamt that we were gonna get married ,  and he left ,  becuz he had to go fight a fire .  and ,  um ,  so okay ,  i went to a night club ,  and i saw him making out with a girl .  
 oh my god ,  he dream - cheated on you !  
boy ,  im glad i wore the big belt today .  
five minutes ago ,  a line like that wouldve floored me .  now nothing .  well ,  not nothing ,  i am still a woman .   
ross ?  lets go .  
oh yeah ,  about telling mom and dad ,  i was thinking about maybe writing a letter .  
alright ,  you know what ?  thats it .  youve had your chance .  
wha - what ?  
 mom !  dad !  ross smoked pot in college !  
 you are such a tattletale !  mom ,  dad ,  you remember that - that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana ?  
it was you ?  
and dad ,  yknow that mailman that you got fired ?  he didnt steal your playboys !  ross did !   
yeah ,  well ,  hurricane gloria didnt break the porch swing ,  monica did !    
ross hasnt worked at the museum for a year !   
monica and chandler are living together !    
ross married rachel in vegas !  and got divorced !  again !  !  !  !   
 i love jacques cousteau !  
 i wasnt supposed to put beef in the trifle !  
what happened son ?  
chandler !  youve been rosss best friend all these years ,  stuck by him during the drug problems .   and now youve taken on monica as well .  well ,  i dont know what to say .  youre a wonderful human being .   
no !  thank you !   monica ,  and ross !  i dont know what im gonna do about the two of you !  
you guys !  it was bananas ,  cream ,  and beef !  i - i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldnt feel bad !  
well actually ,  i - i didnt eat mine .  its still in the bathroom .  
let me ask you ,  why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays ?  i remember when people used to use big lights .  
thats a good story ,  grandpa .   
hey 
wow ,  monicas letting other people help decorate her tree !  did someone get her drunk again or ?  
having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about .  its about being with the people that you love .  
that is nice and were done .  tada !   
i dunno what it is ,  it just doesnt quite feel like christmas to me .  
oh ,  here .   
and thats the story of the dreidle .  now ,  some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians ,  who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year ,  symbolising lifes triumph over death .  and that was like 4000 years ago .  
so ,  pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story .   
hey you guys .  
hey joe whats up ?  
i had to get out of the apartment .  janine is like stretching all over the place .  yknow ,  everywhere i look shes like  
i can see why thats hard to resist .  
i like her so much !  
aw ,  im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way .  
i know .  and shes so sweet .  i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair .  
you are aware that shes not a monkey ,  right ?  
hey guys !  
i just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for new years eve .  its called some sort of dickn rockn dickie eve .

seriously ?  
well ,  you tell a lot of jokes !  
look ,  chandler ,  its my joke .  but ,  hey ,  if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name ,  so it doesnt really matter who gets credit ,  right ?  
yeah ,  i guess .  
 hey guys .  
 hey ,  joey ,  playboy printed my joke .  
no ,  its my joke ,  its mine .  you can call them ,  theyll tell you .  
its my joke .  
its my joke .  
dude ,  you have got to turn on behind the music .  the band heart is having a really tough time ,  and i think they may break up .  
lets go watch it at your place .  
nah ,  monicas watching some cooking show .  come on ,  i dont want to miss when they were skinny .  
chandler ,  chandler ,  yknow what we should do ?  you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses .  
what ?  no ,  i want to watch this .   .  did your cable go out ?  
no ,  thats vh - 1 .  i gotta tell you ,  the music these kids listen to today  .   .   .  its like a lotta noise to me .  i dont know 
joey ,  why is your cable out ?  
i uh ,  oh !  because ,  uh ,  i havent really paid the bill 
if you need money ,  will you please - please just let me loan you some money ?  
no ,  chandler .  look ,  forget about it ,  okay ?  look ,  i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out .  oh ,  was she hot .  
whoa ho .  
i know !  yeah ,  but ,  look i can handle it .  all right ?  look ,  i can listen to the radio ,  huh ?  and ross gave me this great book  .  
 all right ,  you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place ?  
sure .  
 paid your phone bill ?  
 hey .  
 its only you .  
wh - wh - what are you doing ?  
we are looking at a playboy .  
oh ,  i want to look too !   .  yikes !  
so do you think that these picturesare ,  are they trying to tell a story ?  
oh ,  yeah ,  sure .  i mean ,  like in the case of this young woman ,  she has lost her clothes ,  so she rides naked on the horse ,  shes crying out ,  where are they ,  where are they ?  
well ,  shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that .   
oh ,  yeah .  aw ,  remember the days when you used to go out to the barn ,  lift up your shirt ,  and bend over ?  
you see ,  now ,  i would date this girl .  shes cute ,  shes outdoorsy ,  you know ,  and she knows how to build a fire .  i mean ,  thats got to come in handy 
okay ,  ive got a question .  if you had to pick one of us to date ,  who would it be ?  
 i dont know .  
me neither .  
rachel .  
what ?  !  
you forget how many great songs heart had .  
yeah .  
you know ,  barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard .  
so ,  you heard it ,  you repeated it ,  so that must mean you wrote it .  
oh ,  you guys ,  with this joke .  i gotta say ,  i know i cracked up ,  but im not even sure i got it .  
what ,  you didnt get it ?  the doctor is a monkey .   
and monkeys cant write out prescriptions .   
 you are not allowed to laugh at my joke .  
your joke ?  well ,  i think the hef would disagree ,  which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah - dollars .  
so ,  you stole my joke ,  and you stole my money .  
well ,  i was going to stick it in the atm ,  but now i think ill show the sexy teller that i am a published writer .  
well ,  she is going to know that you stole the joke .  
oh ,  what are you going to do ,  follow me down there ?  
yeah !  
well ,  im not going to go now anyway  .  
 here you go .  
well ,  if you want ,  you can work here .  
okay ,  but the moneys good ,  plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want .  
flexible hours .  
 she picked rachel .  i mean ,  she tried to back out of it ,  but it was obvious .  she picked rachel .  
 he took my joke ,  he took it .  
its wrong .  you know what else is wrong ?  phoebe picking rachel .  
you know who else picked rachel ?  ross ,  and you know what else ross did ?  he stole my joke .  you know what ?  im going to get a joke journal .  yknow ?  and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes .  
thats a good idea .  
yeah !  
do you know whats a bad idea ?  
picking rachel .  
thats right .   did you hear something ?  
maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts .  
its coming from the living room .   
 i finished my book .    
 hey ,  you guys .  
 oh ,  dont you guys look cute .  you guys make such a cute couple .  
monica ,  what are you doing ?  
 nothing ,  im just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day .   remember ,  when you picked rachel over me ?  that was funny .  
i guess it was kinda funny .  
 it wasnt funny at all !  why would you do that ?  why didnt you pick me ?  
fine .  the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that youre just kinda high maintenanceokay lets go to lunch !  
that is completely untrue .  you think im high maintenance ?  okay ,  prove it .  i want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point !  
no ,  okay ,  youre right .  youre easy - going .  youre just not as easy - going as rachel .  shes just more flexible and - and mellow .  thats all .  
 well ,  people are different .  
ya ,  you know ,  rachel shell do whatever you want .  yknow ,  you can just walk all over her .  
what ?  wait a minute .  what are you saying ,  that im a pushover ?  im not a pushover .  
oh ,  okay ,   youre not a pushover .  
oh my you think im a pushover .  well wait ,  watch this ,  you know what ?  youre not invited to lunch .  what do you think of that ?  i think thats pretty strong ,  thats what i think .  come on ,  monica ,  lets go to lunch .   
 you start working on that list .    
i cannot believe her .  
i know .  where do you wanna go eat ?  
oh ,  oh ,  i love that japanese place .  
im sick of japanese .  were not going there .  
all right ,  wherever you wanna go is cool .  
yeah ,  that - that chandler cracks me up .   
hey ross ,  listen ,  you want anything to drink ,  cause im heading up there .  
uh ,  yeah ,  ill take a coffee .  thanks ,  man .  
sure .   coffee ?  cause im going up there .  
no .  
no ,  thank you .  
id love an ice water .  
you got it .  
joey ,  what are you doing ?  
just being friendly .   
joey ,  honey ,  i dont think youre supposed to go back there .  
dont wink at me .  and put on your apron .  
okay ,  but i dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons .  
joey ,  do you work here ?  
hey ,  waiter .  
joey ,  whats going on .  what didnt you tell us you work here ?  
its kind of embarrassing ,  yknow .  i mean ,  i was an actor and now im a waiter .  its supposed to go in the other direction .  
so is your apron .  youre wearing it like a cape .  
i mean ,  the jobs easy and the moneys good ,  you know ?  i guess im going to be hanging out here anyway .  i might as well get paid for it ,  right ?  i just feel kind of weird serving you guys .  
come on ,  joey ,  i did it and it was fine .  
yeah ,  why would it be weird ?  hey ,  joey ,  can i get some coffee ?  
okay ,  i guess it doesnt seem that weird .  
seriously ,  i - i asked you before and you still havent gotten it .  
see ,  now its weird again .  
i think its great that you work here .  youre going to make then picks up a pen ,  glares at ross ,  and writes in his journal) .  ah ha ha ,  ,  coffeehouse .  
well ,  you know what ?  this is great .  finally ,  i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too .  let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse .  first of all ,  the customer is always right .   a smile goes a long way .   and if anyone is ever rude to you ?  sneeze muffin .  
thanks ,  rach .  look ,  you guys are just terrific .  yknow ?  now ,  how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers .  its all about turnover .  
joey ,  seriously ,  can i get my coffee ?  
phoebe .  we would like to talk to you for a second .  
okay .  
so ,  maybe i am a little high maintenance .  and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover .  but you know what we decided you are ?  
yes ,  we are very sorry to tell you this ,  but you ,  phoebe ,  are flaky .  
hah !  
that true ,  i am flaky .  
so ,  what ,  youre just ,  youre just okay with being flaky ?  
yeah ,  totally .  
well ,  then ,  im okay with being high maintenance .  
yeah ,  and i am okay with being a pushover .  
thats great .  good for you guys .  
i am not high maintenance !  
i am not a pushover !  
who said you were ?  
no ,  im leaving to get my hair dyed .  
thats the whole part ?  
okay ,  ill see you in an hour .  
oh ,  excuse me .  
i believed you were saving this seat for someone .  
for what ?  
huh ?  what ?  
its my joke .  
its my joke .  
yknow ,  i dont think were going to settle this .  
lets have monica decide .  
yeah !  
yeah !  
hey mon .  
mon ,  get out here !  
monica !   
okay ,  okay .  you have to help us decide whose joke this is .  
why do i have to decide ?  
because youre the only one that can be fair .  
yeah .  
i cant be fair .  youre my boyfriend .  
yeah ,  but im your brother .  were family .  thats the most important thing in the world .  
 dont try to sway her .   im your only chance to have a baby .  okay ,  lets go .  
well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme .  
okay ,  chandler ,  you go first .  
okay ,  i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve .  
oh ,  wait ,  is he the guy i met at christmas ?  
can i finish my story ?  !  
do you want me to pick you ?  !  
see ,  i would never snap at you like that .   
continue .  
so steve said he had to go to the doctor .  and steves doctors name is doctor muppy .  so i said ,  doctor monkey ?  and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up .   
are you kidding ?  okay ,  look .  i - i studied evolution .  remember ,  evolution ?  monkey into man ?  plus ,  im a doctor ,  and i had a monkey .  im doctor monkey !  
im not arguing with that .  
all right ,  ive heard enough .  ive made my decision .   
you are both idiots .  the joke is not funny ,  and its offensive to women ,  and doctors ,  and monkeys !  you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit ,  you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world !  now let it go !  the joke sucks !   
its your joke .  
hi ,  chandler .  there you are .  
hi ,  oh hi .  
hey ,  its phoebe and rachel .  um ,  why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance ?   
 monica is a self - sufficient ,  together lady .   being with her has been like being on a vacation .  and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit .  
wow ,  you know what ?  that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard .  
really ?  ive heard better .  
wait ,  wait ,  he came up with that himself .  tell them ,  chandler .  
 im out of words .  should i just say the whole thing again ?  
look ,  i am not high maintenance .  i am not .  chandler !  
 youre a little high maintenance .  
ahhh !  you are on my list .  
im sorry .  youre not easy - going ,  but youre passionate ,  and thats good .  and when you get upset about the little things ,  i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that .  and thats good too .  so ,  they can say that youre high maintenance ,  but its okay ,  because i like maintaining you .  
 i didnt even tell him to say that .   .  all right youre off my list .  
 im off the list .   
 phoebe ,  its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend .  
 yknow ,  suddenly i find you very attractive .   
hey ,  buddy boy ,  howd the audition go ?  
not good ,  no .  i didnt get the part ,  and i lost my job here ,  so 
wow !  that is a bad audition .  
how - how did you lose your job here ?  
well ,  i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed .  so ,  i went anyway ,  and then he fired me .  
he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youve been working here two days ?  thats not ,  thats not right .  
yeah ,  what are ya gonna do ?  
okay .  
he can have his job back .  
thats right ,  he can have his job back .  im glad we got that all straightened out .  there you go ,  joey ,  you got your job back .  
thats great .  thanks rach .  
yeah ,  pretty nice ,  huh ?  now whos a pushover ?  
 rach ,  youre in my seat .  
hey ,  i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend .  
i pick you ,  phoebe .  
oh ,  yeah .  definitely you ,  pheebs .

hey .

rachel and i had a really big fight ,  can i come in ?  i - i mean i know were not supposed to see each other anymore and im okay with that ,  its just that i dont know anybody in the city and i really need somebody to talk to about it .  
 i dont want to talk about it .  
but you know what might really cheer me up ?

ross !  i think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me !  
so thats the only reason she could be here huh ?  it couldnt have anything to do with the fact that - that maybe im a good listener and i uh i put on a great slide show !  
ross ,  i am telling you that she is using you to get back at me !  
hey !  
hey !  
so ,  i just came from the company ursula works for .

um - mmm ,  and i wont have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address .  
thats great ,  but isnt it gonna bother that people still think youre a porn star ?  
oh no !  no !  i know how to handle it .

hey .  
 you uh ,  you may have been right about jill .  
oh !  i knew it !  what happened ?  
umm ,  she kissed me .  
what ?  !  you kissed !  
 maybe we should give them some privacy .  
 shhhh !  !  !  
look ,  i uh ,  i tried not to kiss her ,  okay ?  
well ,  it doesnt sound like it !  i mean ,  its pretty easy not to kiss someone ,  you just dont kiss them !  see look at us ,  right now ,  not kissing !  
let me finish ,  okay ?  she started kissing me and - and i didnt stop it .  i guess i - i just wasnt thinking 
yeah thats right you werent thinking !  yknow what ?  let me give you something to think about !   
oh waithold it !  but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing .  
oh ,  well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sisters mouth long enough to tell me that .  
look i - i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us !  
what ?  !  
no ,  i mean ,  look i dont know if anything is going to happen with us ,  again .  ever .  but i dont want to know that it - it never could .  so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector .  
wow .  i ,  i dont even know what to say .  thank you .   
youre welcome .    
oh my god !  are - are you crying ?

bye - bye - e !  
bye .  
hey ,  you guys !  guess what ?  barry and mindy are getting a divorce !  
oh my god !  
wow !  
 what is the matter with you ?  !  
no !  barry and mindy .  
oh sorry ,  i hear divorce i immediately go to ross .   who - whos barry and mindy ?  
barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend .  
ohh - oh ,  wasnt he cheating on you with her ?  
yeah ,  but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me .  
why did they get divorced ?  
well ,  apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else .  isnt that sad ?   god ,  could you imagine if i actually married him ?  !  i mean how different would my life be ?  
i know what you mean ,  ive always wondered how different my life would be if - if id never gotten divorced .  
which time ?  
the first time !  no seriously ,  imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian .  
 i cant .  i keep seeing it the good way .  
id bet id still be doing my kara - tay .   towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara - tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow ,  not doing anything else physical .  
maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara - tay .  
and what if i was still fat ?   well ,  you wouldnt be dating me ,  thats for sure .  
 oh yeah !  come on !  yeah right !  
what ,  you guys really think that im that shallow ?  
no ,  i just think monica was that fat .  
hey ,  imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives !   oh - hey ,  theres carol again !  
what if i had had the guts to quit my job ?  id probably be writing for the new yorker ,  getting paid to be funny .  but my jobs fun too !  i mean tomorrow ,  i - i dont have to wear a tie .  
what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch ?  
what ?  !  
merrill lynch ?  
yeah ,  i had a massage client who worked there and - and he said i had a knack for stocks .  
well why didnt you take the job ?  
because at that time you see ,  i thought everything that rhymed was true .  so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks ,  id have to live in a box ,  and only eat lox ,  and have a pet fox .  
 oh my god !  rachel green ?  
 rob tillman !  
no - no .  its - its me ,  ross !  
oh ,  im sorry .  ross tillman .

look i - i dont know whats going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker ,  look can i just say not all men are like that .  
oh .   
hey !  there are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work !  okay ?  there are some men who will stand by and - and watch as their wives engage in - in what only can be described as a twosome with some - some woman she barely knows from the gym !  
who are these men ?  
men .  i guy i know .  
well ,  you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay .  
she is not  shes gay .  oh my god .  she is so gay !  i cant believe this .  
good day for married people huh ?  
im sorry your husband cheated on you .

 okay to come in ?  
yeah ,  come on ,  eat ,  whatever you want .  dr .  roger got beeped again .  
yeah i know ,  guess who beeped him ?  
what ?  !  
im the ruptured spleen .   
why would you do that ?  
because you shouldnt be with him .   you should be with me .  
really ?  
yeah !  when you were talking about roger ,  that was killing me !  look ,  things like last night they dont just happen .  yknow ?  or at least not to me .  or with the other two women ,  in the morning yknow i was just lying there and i couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends ,  but with you i always yknow with a friend .  
chandler !  
i know you probably dont want to go out with me ,  yknow because i make too many jokes and ive never been in a serious relationship and i guess im not technically a  &quot; doctor  &quot;   
there was just one woman ,  wasnt there ?  
no ,  there were two .  
including me ?  
hey ,  remember when i had a monkey ?  
yeah .  
yeah ,  what ,  what was i thinking ?  
 hey !  so ,  whats with the 20 percent tip ?  did i do something wrong ?  
twenty percent is a pretty generous tip joe .  
yknow whats more generous than that ?  !  fifty percent !  yknow whats even more generous than that ?  !  !  
i see where youre goin !  
whats up with the greed joe ?  
all right ,  look im sorry you guys ,  but its just that i gotta get these new head shots made .  and theyre really expensive ,  yknow ?  im down to like three !  well ,  actually two cause one of em i kinda blackened in some teethwhy did i do that ?  !   
well isnt there something you can do to earn a little extra money ?  i mean ,  cant - cant you pick up ,  i dont know ,  an extra shift here ?

oh ,  wait !  wait !  dont you have an audition today ?  yeah !  maybe youll get that job !  
oh ,  ha - ha - ha !  ooh !  wait a minute ,  i used to get medical experiments down on me all the time !

 joey !  
what did i tell you about talking to your friends while youre working ?  
that guy  has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes !  hes complained about you three times !

ohh !  i would kill for a salmon skin roll right now !  
yknow what ?  fine !  get attacked !  i dont even care !  
 come on ross .  were sorry .  please tell us what it is .  
unagi is a state of total awareness .  okay ?  only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you !  
you mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish ?   
 all im saying is ,  its one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack ,  i dont know ,  like a  surprise !  !   
all right ,  you know that one was coming ,  but that doesnt mean you have unagi .   
 ooh !  yknow what ?  if we made reservations ,  we could have unagi in about a half - hour .  
yknow what

yeah ,  take your time .   
ross ,  look ,  i know ive been giving you a lot of jabs and its partly because im very protective of lizzie ,  and partly because well ,  they just keep coming to me .  but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many ,  many ,   many stories that rachel has told me that ,  well  youre not  all bad .  
and anyhow ,  im sorry i was so harsh before ,  but you have to understand that i  still look at lizzie like shes a twelve - year - old girl .  
i beg your pardon ?  
you have a son ?  
dont worry about it ,  i just didnt realize you were married .

you two were married ?  !  
chandler ,  we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six .  
we said seven !  
we said six !  
the only way that i said six would be if the sevens ,  let meet at seven ,  not at six .

okay ,  okay .  uh ,  well uh ,  rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear .   
ross .

yeah .  but then i changed my mind .  im funny like that .  so i told lizzie ,  now im telling you ,  i dont want you seeing my daughter anymore .  
yes it does .  
ill call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired .

now ,  have you told anyone else ?  
no ,  i dont want to tell anybody else because i dont want monica to find out .  
you told me .

good .  although yknow ,  he - hes a private guy .  yknow ,  i wish i could get him to open up a little bit ,  share some feelings .  
thats easy !  you just have to think of him as a - as a jar of pickles that wont open .  
so what are you saying; i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table ?  
 hi honey .  
hi !

i didnt do it !  it was chandler !  hes hes mad at you !  
what ?  !  why ?  !  
please ,  i think you know why .  
i cant think of anything .  
come on ross ,  youre a paleontologist ,  dig a little deeper .  
wait a minute ,  is it because joey and i didnt invite him to that knicks game a couple of weeks ago ?  
do you think thats something that hed be mad at you for ?  
i guess it could .  
well then i think thats it .  
well ,  if hes angry ,  he really shouldnt just cover it up .  i - i wish he would just tell me the truth .  
honey i made a reservation at china garden ,  is that okay ?  
it was fine .  
im thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress .  
are you talking about having sex ?  
normal .  
nope !  that never happened to me !  
nope .  
okay .  
okay .  
when i was six years old .  
i wanted a big wheel .  and instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on .  it was embarrassing; kids made fun of me .  that was a pretty tough year .  
it was horrible .  they called me chicken boy .  
and in fifth grade i got into a fight .  well ,  it wasnt really a fight .  richard darinvel bit me on the nose and ,  and i feel down .  i still have a little scare right here  you can see it .

chicken ?   chicken boy !  
nothin !  this is the nine millionth ring store weve been too and i cant find the perfect ring !   ugly ring !  ugly ring !  ugly ring !   its a beautiful selection .

what ?  !  i cant believe youre trying to stifle me !  when just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me !  
oh rachel ,  im so sorry .  i didnt mean to overwhelm you .  its just that ,  when those gates open ,  you  hard to close em .  but they are closed now .  believe me .  
 hey .  
i cant believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring !  
its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring !  its a beautiful ring !  
no ,  its not !  when i looked at the other ring i could see monicas face when i gave it to her ,  yknow ?  and i could see her saying yes .  when i look at this ring ,  all i see is a ring !  unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye .   look ,  this is the most important thing im gonna do in my life .  i wanna make sure its perfect .  
okay .  there may be a way that we can get the other ring back .  cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose .  so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something .  
i cant do that .  
there he is !   
okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger .  
wow !  youre good !  after this ,  we should solve crimes .  
yeah !  okay ,  go ,  go ,  go get him .  
who is it ?  
do you know who at my office ?  
oh john !  great !   
 here he is .  
 hi !  hi .  okay ,  there was a slight mix - up at the jewelry store ,  the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me .  so ,  im gonna need to have that back .   but ,  in exchange im willing to trade you this beautiful ,  more expensive ring .   ew .  
it is beautiful ,  but im gonna use this one .  now ,  if youll excuse me .  
no - no !  this is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring .  you dont want to break her heart now do you ?  
youre dying ?  !   
yeah ,  shes dying of a cough apparently .  
yes ,  and it is my dying wish to have that ring .  see ,  if im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity

oh ross ,  sometimes grown - ups have commitments they just cant get out of !

why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff .  i mean thats what i did when i first  weighing stuff .

hmm .  
shes leaving for three months .  
for camp !  
okay ,  good stuff .  umm ,  well shes - shes sweet and pretty and

glove salesman !  
good one !  yeah .  
this is terrible .  what am i going to do ?  
look ,  she only suspects something okay ?  she doesnt know for sure ,  so just throw her off the track .  
thats right ,  i can throw her off .  i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind .  
yeah !  yeah !  convince her that - that youre scared of commitment !  convince her that youre a little coward !  
i can do that ,  ive had 30 years of practice .  
hey ,  being you is finally gonna pay off !   
 i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes !  
that guys still doing that ?  !  
 hey !   oh my god youre here ,  let me see your hand !  !  
 ross !  wait !  
you suck !  !  
what ?  !   
okay ,  okay ,  here she comes !   how do i look ?  do i look like a guy who doesnt want to get married ?  
yeah !  and also ,  a little like a french guy .   i never noticed that before .  
 hi guys !  
hey !  
hey !  
what are you up too ?  
oh ,  just hanging out ,  talkin about uh ,  websites .   yeah ,  we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you .  
 yeah ,  big brother .  
well thats a little crazy .  although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the internet .  
yeah ,  well yknow ,  it just got me thinking though ,  why would anybody ever want to get married huh ?  
why ?  !  to celebrate your relationship !  to solidify your commitment !  to declare your love for one another to the world !  
eh 
okay well thats good to know .   
hey monica ,  theres a customer who wants to complement the chef ,  should i let him in ?  
hi !  
actually ,  im not here to complement the chef .  
well ,  it was great seeing you the other night .  
i still love you .  and i know i probably shouldnt even be here telling you this ,  i mean youre with chandler a guy i really like ,  and if you say hes straight ill believe you !  after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didnt tell ya id regret it for the rest of my life .  letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did .  
well yeah ,  im sorry .  i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya !  i wanna spend my life with you .  i wanna marry you .  i wanna have kids with you .  
i know this is crazy but am i too late ?  
well i know i was an idiot !  and i tried to forget you ,  i really did !  yknow after we had lunch last year i spent six months in africa trying to get you out of my head !  
working with blind kids .  
okay thats fine ,  ill walk away .  and ill never bother you again ,  but only if you tell me chandlers willing to give you everything i am .  
you are ?  
why ?  
isnt it incredible ?  !  monica and chandler ,  gettin married .  
i know ,  theyre gonna be so happy together .  
ohh i mean two best friends falling in love ,  how often does that happen ?  
not that often !  
no !  im so happy for them !  
me too !  so happy for them !  
im so happy and not at all jealous .  
oh no !  no god ,  definitely not jealous !   
i mean im probably 98% happy ,  maybe 2% jealous .  and i mean whats 2% ?  thats nothing .  
totally .  im like 90 / 10 .  
yeah me too .   
hey uh ,  have you guys scene chandler ?  
so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday ,  you dont really believe that do you ?  
sure i do .  in fact ,  i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural .  i mean look at pigs .  lets take a second here and look at pigs .  okay pigs dont mate for life .  i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime ,  and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports !  
yeah ,  but thats pigs not people !  
if marriage worked ,  id be all for it .  but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ?  97% .  
wait a minute .  are you honestly telling me that - that you may never want to get married ?  
well ,  never say never but yknow probably uh yeah ,  never .  
oh my god !  then - then - then what are we even doing ?  !  what is this ?  !  
whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what is all this pressure ?  !  is this some new kind of strategy ?  why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap ?  !  
yknow what ?  !  i gotta go !  ugh !   
were gonna find love !  
definitely !  
yeah ,  im pretty confident about that .  thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler !  it would be nice to have a little guarantee though .  
what do you mean ?  
well yknow ,  some people make deals with a friend ,  like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40 ,  they marry each other .  
you mean a backup ?  
exactly !  
yeah ,  yeah i got that .  
you do ?  
hm - mmm .  
who ?  
joey .  
joey ?  !  
yeah !  
are you serious ?  !  
yeah ,  i locked him years ago !  
wh so if neither of you are married by the time youre 40 ,  youre gonna marry joey .  
yep ,  we shook on it .  yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal .  
oh ,  seriously ?  
ohh ,  yeah .  i think his exact words were  
charming .  
well hey ,  its just a backup .  
hey monica !  
have you seen rachel ?  or a mirror ?  
this is for my boat ,  pretty cool huh ?  
yeah ,  its great .  
whoa - whoa ,  whats the matter ?  !  talk to the captain !  
im just having one of those days where you realize youre in a dead - end relationship !  
chandler giving you a hard time huh ?  
its not like i want to get married tomorrow !  its just that i - id like to believe that im in a relationship thats actually going somewhere ,  that im not just wasting my time !  
well ,  you know chandler .  
no i dont know chandler !  not anymore !  its like its like somethings changed .  
maybe you changed ?  
i didnt change !  
maybe thats the problem .  
what ?  !  
chandler is a complex fellow ,  one who is unlikely to take a wife .  
is that some kind of boat talk ?  
i dont know !   i havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet .  
what does he think ?  does he think im just gonna wait around for nothing ?  
monica face it ,  chandler is against marriage .  and - and always will be !  
 well theres some people who do want to marry me .  
there are ?  
yeah !  richard !  
r - r - richard said he wants to marry you ?  !   and - and chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage ?  !  
thats right .  
chandler loves marriage !  !  
you just told me that he hates marriage !  that - that hes a - a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife !  that - that hes against marriage and always will be !  
when the cretaceous period ended ,  the dinosaurs were gone .  
what happened you guys ?   
rach !  
hey you !  
hey ,  come on in .  
oh thank you .  hey yknow ,  im so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth .  
oh ,  thanks .  yeah ,  i really thought wed be able to make it work ,  but uh ,  i guess it just wasnt meant to be .  
yeah ,  love .  its a tricky business isnt it ?  
i guess so .  
so what do you say we make a pact ?  if you and i are both single by the time were 40 ,  we get married .  i mean ,  we know each other ,  we like each other ,  and weve - weve already slept together so yknow therell be no surprises there !  you know what i mean ?  no like ,   &quot; whats that ?  !  &quot;  
right .  ohh !  you - you want me to be your backup .  
exactly .  
ohh ,  yeah i already have one .

phoebe ?  !  wait abut - but she just ,  she said that joey was her backup .  
ohh ,  i dont think so .

where the hell have you been ?  !  
i was making a coconut phone with the professor .  
richard told monica he wants to marry her !  
what ?  !  
yeah !  yeah ,  ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldnt keep flying off !

i know !  
well what yknow what im gonna do ?  im gonna go over there; im gonna kick his ass !   will you help me ?  !

well ,  i dont think monica is gonna take this away .  
wouldnt she ?  
would she ?  
guess who ?   
hey .

what do you think monica meant when she said she didnt want to talk ,  especially with me ?  i mean ,  why not especially you and me ?  we were both out there kissing .  
still thinking about it huh ?  
come on !  serious - ser - ser - seriously ,  what did she mean by that ?   especially you !  
 oh ,  who cares ?  
i care !  
 and so do i .  
yknow what ,  i - i have to go talk to her ,  would you let me just get changed ?  
okay .  sure .   
am i going to let you watch me undress ?  
i cant believe her ,  yknow its justits so typical .  
now monica ,  i know youre upset ,  but dont forget .  there is going to be a wedding ,  you are going to throw the bouquet ,  and then theres going to be a honeymoon ,  maybe in paris .  
paris ?  
we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la  .

pheebs ,  were not giving you a deposit for our wedding !  
oh ,  i see .   [cut to the living room ,  joey is eating a sandwich . ) 
they break your heart ,  dont they ?  
yknow ,  i dont really need their permission .  
yeah !  if you wanna sing at their wedding ,  well you sing at their wedding !  
yeah !  and if you wanna look 19 ,  then you you gotta do something about your eyes .  
what ?  !  whats wrong with my eyes .  
they give you away !  theres just - theres just too much wisdom in there .   just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes .  
and thatll get rid of my wisdom ?  
maybe just 10 minutes for you .   
oh ,  give her the deposit !  give her the ring !  i dont care !   
yes .  
monica ,  what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone ,  especially me ?  
what a great apology !   and you accept !  okay ,  bye - bye !

well ,  lets just say its not the first time youve stolen my thunder .  
what ?  !  
 hey ,  heres a thought .   
monica ,  what are you talking about ?  
my sweet sixteen !  remember ,  you went to third base with my cousin charlie .  
 ahh ,  third base .  
its all everybody at the party could talk about !  
monica ,  yknow what ?  the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring !  
 we had a caricaturist !  
oh !  !  
  &quot; whenever i get married ,  guess who wont get to sing ?  somebody named geller !  and somebody else named bing !  &quot;   
monica ,  your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago .  
and yet ,  here we are doing it again .  
ugh ,  monica i dont want to steal your stupid thunder !  
oh please !  why else would you have made out with ross ?  !  
got me .   
all right ,  easy mimey ,  the moment has passed ,  it aint gonna happen !  
i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night !  
i swear ,  i never wanted any part of your night !  
oh ,  is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes ?  !  
uh ,  rachel ,  ive been thinking .  i dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea .  im calling it off .  
 why to save your dignity my man .  
 monica ,  why ?  why would i ever want to take away from your night ?  
i dont know !  i dontmaybe youre feeling a little resentful .  maybe ah ,  maybe you thought youd get married first !  maybe you cant stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you !  
oh wow .  thatyknow what ?  that is so unfair .  yknow what ?  now i want to steal your thunder !  come on ross ,  lets go have sex !   
 i cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night !  !  
well ,  somebody should .    
look uh ,  if were gonna do this 
were not gonna do this ,  all right ?  shes just gonna think that were doin it .  
oh ,  i see ,  so everybody wins .   
who is it ?  
 its monica ,  open up !  
okay well ross !  stop it please !  wait a minute !   
oww !  
yeah ,  you like that baby ?   may we help you ?  
i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together ,  but i must warn you ,  the night that you announce your engagement im going to announce that im pregnant !  
how is that ever going to happen ?  !  
all right monica ,  do you want to know why i was with ross tonight ?  !  
i know why !  
no you dont know why !  
okay !  why ?  !  
because !  because i was sad .  
what do you mean ?  
look ,  i am so so happy for you guys ,  but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that im not .  im not even close .  and i dont know ,  maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better .  and i know that thats dumb ,  but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler !   
 i dont care ,  she slept with me .

this baby has got everything .  take yknow ,  locations for instance .   first ,  organized alphabetically ,  then geographically ,  then by square footage .

of course you can look at it !  yeah ,  i want your opinion too !  
okay .  
here you go !  what do you think about centerpieces ?  
centerpieces !

phoebe ,  what are you doing ?  
im sorry ,  im with a client right now .  
phoebe !

whats the big deal ?  i did it at monica and chandlers !  
and they knew about it ?  
 okay ,  well ross ,  what is this really about ?

hey joey ,  what cha doing ?

joey ,  did you eat my face cream ?   
where are you going ?  the vicar wont be home for hours .   
joey ,   where did you learn that word ?  
where do you think ,   zelda ?

joey ,  what - what are you doing going into my bedroom ?  !  
okay ,  look im sorry ,  i went in there to take a nap and i know i shouldnt have ,  but you got porn !  
hey - hey ,  yknow what ?  i dont care !  im not ashamed of my book .  theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica .  its just a healthy expression of female sexuality ,  which by the way ,  you will never understand .   
hi ,  is uh phoebe here ?  
ohh great .  
well ,  i dont know .  are you a masseur ?  
so chandler ,  your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged .  
i remember when we first got engaged .  
oh ,  i dont think i ever heard that story .  
 you dont know how that happened ?  !  your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy !  
what a sweet story .  
what ?  !  they wanted a scary story !  
you tell her jack ,  i cant do it .  
were sorry honey ,  but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself .  
we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell ,  so we redid the kitchen .  
well it was chandler !  we didnt think hed ever propose !  
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .   
i cant believe this .  do you think that your parents could help pay for it ?  
i dont know ,  my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding .  shes saving the rest for her divorce .  and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  dollywood .  
well what happened at dinner ?  
my parents spent the money for our wedding !  
 my god !  what did you order ?  !  
wait ,  but theres no money !  well this is terrible !  you guys are gonna have to get married in like a ,  rec .  center !  
honey ,  its gonna be okay .  
no !  no its not !  its not gonna be okay !  it sucks !  no swing band !  no lilies !  
no ,  yknow what ?  its gonna be okay .  i mean you dont have to have this rustic italian feast .  yknow ?  and - and you dont need ,  you dont need this custom - made ,  empire - waisted ,  duchess ,  satin gown; you can wear off the rack .   
look ,  it really is gonna be okay .  the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married .  
do you even understand what off the rack means ?  !  
look ,  why dont you just pay for it yourself ?  
how ?  i dont have any money .  
well ,  i have some .  
how much ?  
well ,  close to  
whoa !  !  !  are you kidding me ?  !  
well what ?  !  how - how much is it ?  !  
its enough for wedding scenario eight .  
ohh !   really ?  !

look ,  i understand ,  but i have to put my foot down .  okay ?  the answer is no .  
you - youre gonna have to put your foot down ?  
yes ,  i am !

 i gave him an extremely professional massage !  
he said you poked at him with wooden spoons .  
okay ,  so it wasnt uh ,  a traditional massage .  but i did give him acu - pressure with a pair of chopsticks .  and ,  and i gently exfoliated him with ,  with a mop .

oh ,  so you finally took it out of the marina huh ?  
why would i do that ?  it took three guys to get the thing in there !  
if you dont sail your boat ,  what do you do on it ?  
oh ,  its great !  its a great place to just kinda ,  sit ,  hang around ,  drink a few beers ,  eat some chips .   
well ,  its good that you finally have a place to do that .  
yknow joey ,  i could teach you to sail if you want .  
you could ?  
yeah !  ive been sailing my whole life .  when i was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat .  
your own boat ?  
do you know what i was thinkin ?  
what ?  
nothing ,  i just like to go like this .   
 hey chandler ,  what are you doing tonight ?  
uh why ,  do you have a lecture ?  
no ,  why ?  
then free as a bird .  whats up ?  
my dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us .  
wow !  thats great !  dad must really like you ,  he doesnt ask just anyone to play .  
yeah and he didnt really ask for you ,  he asked for chancy ,  i assumed he meant you .  
well ,  did - did you correct him ?  
no ,  i - i thought it would be more fun this way .  
this is so cool ,  maybe this is something you can do every week .  
or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans .  he does that every week too .  
oh ,  just so you know ,  you - you have to let him win .  
yeah .  
he hates to lose .  
oh no problem ,  maybe ill play with my left hand .  
youre not a lefty ?  
does anybody know me ?  !   
whats wrong phoebe ?  
i just went to my old apartment to get you the - the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up !  
no !  !  why didnt you make a copy and - and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original ?  !  !  
 because im normal !  that was the one legacy my grandmother left me ,  and i know you wanted it as an engagement present .  
oh ,  we have to get you an engagement present ?  
dont worry about it pheebs .  
no one got me an engagement present .  
okay ,  here i wish you health and happiness .   
an old cookie ?  
 this is what happens when you dont register for gifts !  
see no - no ,  i made a batch and i froze it ,  and this is the only one left .  
we cant accept this .  
why not ?  
cause its gross .  
no !  wait !  i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie !  i do stuff like this at work all the time .  
really ?  !  
yeah !  i bet i can do it .   
okay ,  we owe you a present .  
 look at this clown !  just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river .   get out of the way jackass !   who names his boat coast guard anyway ?  
that is the coast guard .  
what are they doing out here ?  the coasts all the way over there .   
joey ,  just ignore the boats all right ?  were not finished with the lesson yet .  
all right .  
okay ,  im just gonna go over the basic points just one more time ,  are you ready ?  
come on rach ,  not again .  i got it !  okay ?  lets start sailing ,  and i want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is !   yo - ho - ho !  
oh ,  okay .  is that what you want to do ?  you wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old ,  hot chickas ?  okay ,  lets do that sailor joe .  quick question though ,   whats this called ?  
uh ,  boat rope .  
wrong !  how do you get the mainsail up ?  
uh ,  rub it ?  
no .  what do you do if i say we are coming about ?  
id say ,  come again .  no - no ,  wait i - i - i know this one ,  i know this one ,  uh  
times up ,  now you &apos;re dead .  
and deaf !  
okay ,  you just go on and make your little jokey - jokes ,  but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea .  am i getting through to you sailor ?  !   
yes .  
dont just say yes !  this isnt a game ,  joey ,  you can really get hurt out here .  okay ,  so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die ?  !  
all right ,  i definitely taste nutmeg .  
you do ?  
you dont ?   well ,  thats the difference between a professional and a layman .  
that and arrogance .  
 hey .  
hey !  how was sailing ?  
i dont want to talk about it .  yknow ,  you couldve at least saved me a whole cookie .   
 women are mean !  !  !   
i cant believe that !  now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb .   i wish you a long and happy marriage .  
 hey .  
hey !  how was it ?  
well i had a great time !  umm ,  chancy on the other hand 
i will tell the story !  it was going great .  i let him win .  we were bonding .  he even said i could call him dad .  
and what did he ask you not to call him ?  
daddy .  all right look ,  heres the story .   well ,  we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam .  i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy .   so i take off my glasses and thats when it happened .   
guys ?  
oh my god chandler !  i cant believe it !  
i know .  
you gave my father a lap dance !  
why do they put so much steam in there ?  !  
cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room .  
why ?  okay ?  why ?  wh - wh - why did that have to happen ?  
come on ,  its not that big a deal !  
not that big a deal ?  there there was touching of things .  
now ,  i know you wanted to bond with my dad ,  but did you really have to bond to that part ?  
listen ,  im sure that dad doesnt care .  he probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years !  
i dont want him to tell this story for years .  
oh ,  but he will .  he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp .  
i wasnt escaping .  
then how did you get caught in the barbed wire ?  
i was trying to help out a squirrel .  
you were trying to eat it !   
if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off !  
 all right ,  im off to see your dad .  
whoa - whoa ,  arent you a little over dressed ?  
 yeah ,  and - and you better make sure he tips you this time .  
look ,  i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore ,  and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap .  and by face ,  i dont mean my ass .   
 hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present ?  
i dont know .  yknow ,  they didnt get us anything .  
thank you !  
 hey .  
hey .  
well hello !  so ,  when are we gettin back out on the water matey ?  
oh uh ,  i dont know the boat way to say this ,  but uh never !  
why not ?  
because !  youre mean on the boat !  
what ?  i was just trying to teach you .  
well ,  lesson learned !  rachel is mean !  
yeeeeeep yep - yep - yep - yep - yep .  i remember when she took me out on her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all .  
excuse me ,  i wanted you to help ,  but you couldnt move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets .  
you have to respect the sea !   
look joey ,  im sorry if - if you thought that was mean ,  but i gotta tell ya something .  that was not mean .  okay ,  my father is mean .  he used to yell at me all the time on the boat ,  i mean it was horrible .  i was just being a good teacher .  
does a good teacher say ,   &quot; put down the beer pinhead !  ?  &quot;  
well ,  does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson ?  
six and a half !  you knocked that last one out of my hand !  remember ?  
yeah ,  i didnt want you to get hit by the boom !  
well it hit me anyway !  and it wouldve hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer .  
all right ,  yknow what ?  i - im sorry .  i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling .  
you wont boss me around anymore ?  
i wont boss you around .  
and youll be nice ?  
and ,  ill be nice .  
and youll be topless ?  
andjoey !

lets give it a shot .  
okay .  man ,  i have not made this many cookies since i was in the ninth grade .  
oh ,  what was that for ?  like a bake sale ?  
no ,  just a friday night .   
oh ,  these are pretty good .  
yeah ,  but not as good as batch 17 .  
which one was that ?  
the ones we had right after you almost threw up .  
oh yeah !  batch 17 was good .  i did not like batch 16 .   im okay .  
are there any more from the good batch ?  cause we could just work off of those .  
okay joey honey ,  youre doing really good !  all right ,  now im just gonna need you to step to the port side .   remember ?  remember how we talked about the port side ?

uh ,  wow ,  you just said a bunch of stuff i didnt know there .  
joey ,  come on !  we just went over this !   
oh ,  yknow ,  when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth .  did you see it ?  it was gross !  
 no !  all right ?  !  i did not see the bird !  i did not see the fish !  i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson !  i did not ,  because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat !  which obviously is an impossible thing to do !  
all right thats it !  youre yelling and i dont see you taking your top off !  i quit !  
what do you mean you quit ?  !  you cant quit !  
why not ?  !  
because youre not finished yet and i wont have it !  greens do not quit !

awww 
yeah ,  its okay .  i know what a mainsail is .   i know ,  i know to duck when the boom comes across .  i - i know port is right .

yknow ,  i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that were trying to figure out her recipe .  i bet shes l - l - lookin up at us and smiling right now .  
looking up ?  
oh yeahno ,  she was really nice to me ,  but shes in hell for sure .  
well ,  ive tried everything .  i give up .  i guess im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies .  i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe .  kids love that right .  
aww ,  pheeb ,  come on isnt there any relative that would have the recipe ?  what about ,  what about your sister ?  
oh no - no ,  no ,  i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body .  and thats not happening til october 15th ,  2032 .  
thats the day youre gonna die ?  seedarnit ,  ive got shuffleboard that day .  
thats what you think .  
well ,  i mean what about friends of your grandmothers ?  wouldnt they have the recipe ?  
well ,  yknow i may have relatives in france who would know .  my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother ,  nesele tolouse .  
what was her name ?  
nesele toulouse .  
nestle tollhouse ?  !  
oh ,  you americans always butcher the french language .  
 phoebe ,  is this the recipe ?   
 yes !  !   oh .  
i cannot believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time !  
i understand completely ,  theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in - laws .  as a matter of fact ,  when i started dating judy i was unemployed ,  and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer .  
they never did ,  so if you ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along .  shall we ?   
well joey ,  i hate to admit it ,  your way of sailing is a lot more fun .  
yeah ,  yeah .  hey ,  why dont you give a pull on that rope ?

yeah well ,  maybe she shouldve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom .  
well ,  i dont think we are gonna have that problem ,  but maybe thats just because i am not emotionally unavailable !

im gettin back together with my ex - girlfriend .  
what ?  
my god !

well maybe she wouldnt have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was !  
we kinda need to talk .  
both of you together ?  
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there .  so  
were gonna give it another try .

if phoebe were my maid of honor

lewis posin !  he was my best friend in fifth grade ,  and - and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no .  do you know why ?  
because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom ?  !  
no !  but because he thought i was too faaaaa  .   and every time i think about it ,  it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade !  yknow ,  i - i really think that you should apologize to julie .  
what ?  are you kidding ?  that was like 16 years ago .  
no ,  i know .  but yknow what ?  it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me .  
okay ,  all right ,  this is how its going to work .  were gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10 ,  1 being the highest .

because its the highest .   okay ,  rachel monica ,  the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet .  go !   
 i dont want to marry chandler !  
okay ,  uh 
ive got cold feet .  
its gonna be okay !  
no ,  one man for the rest of my life ?  i dont know if i can do it !  this means ill never get to sleep with joey !  
look monica ,  getting cold feet is very common .  yknow ,  its - its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler .  and also ,  i ran out on a wedding .  you dont get to keep the gifts .  
 very good !  drawing on your own experience ,  i like that !

thank you .  thank you very much .  umm ,  ive known them separately and ive known them together and - and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love .  so i would like to raise my glass  to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together .  i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey .  
wow .   good speech .  
yeah ,  it really was !  
aw ,  thanks !  
okay phoebe ,  i guess youre next  although i really dont see the point .  
yeah .  
okay ,  i cant believe that monica and chandler are getting married .  i remember talking about this today with rachel while we were showering together ,  naked .    
hello skidmark .  
 its a nickname ,  ill explain later .  
its pretty clear .  
thats why you broke up with me ?  
all right ,  well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well .  okay ?  you should be proud of yourselves .  and - and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers .  well ,  except for racheldamnit !  
really ?  !  i won !  
what ?  !  
im sorry rach ,  it was ,  it was really close .  
well then i demand a recount !   
actually ,  it wasnt that close .  
no !  yknow what ?  no !  no !  you thing was so stupid anyway ,  this was ridiculouswere gonna flip a coin !   all right ?  !   heads !   
the coins have finally forgiven me !  
well yknow what ?  i hope monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian ,  voodoo ,  goddess circley shower !   
 rach ,  its gonna be okay !   you guys are the best !  
boy i tell ya ,  that judging stuff took a lot out of me .  
yeah ?  
yeah !  i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch .   
why - why would i care about that ?  
as bad as that went ,  i actually enjoyed myself .  i think that im going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do .  
why dont you just stop doing stupid things ?  then you wouldnt have to apologize .  
i would really love it if i could do both .  
all right ,  i i have to ask .  
what ?  
are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again ?  
what ?  !  
well ,  you broke up with julie grath !  how much weight could she have gained ?  
a hundred and forty - five pounds .  
in one year ?  !  my god what did she eat ?  her - her family !  thats not the point .  
look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody ,  but i was 15 !  
well thats not the only time this was an issue .  you remember when umm ,  you spent thanksgiving with us ?  you called me fat .  
okay .  okay ,  now wait a minute that was totally different .  
how ?  
you were not supposed to hear that !  i said that behind you back !  
what if i have babies ,  okay ?  i mean im gonna look different .  im okay with that ,  but im not sure that you are !  
look you have to realize i dont think of you as a thin ,  beautiful woman .   see this is one of things that i can apologize for later !  look ,  what i mean is youre monica !  okay ?  and i am in love with monica .  
keep going .  
so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you .  
even if i shrink down to two inches tall ?  
id carry you around in my pocket .  
i love you .   
hi pheebs .  
hi !  
hi !  i just want to apologize .  im really sorry i was a baby .  
thats ridiculous rachel ,  we were all babies once .   oh ,  you mean today .  
yeah .  yeah ,  and yknow you - you deserve to win .  and - and yknow i was thinking about it ,  if - if youre monicas maid of honor that means i get to be yours .  
oh yeah !  
yeah !  oh ,  umm when - when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together ,  yknow just in case 
oh thats so sweet thanks .  
here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves .  and - and ohh god this is funny ,  look ,  this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride .   and look ,  she made me carry her train ,  which was weird because i was wonder woman .  oh and heres a little purse that i found .   yknow i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there .  
ohh .  
and umm ,  vintage handkerchiefs yknow cause ,  people cry at weddings .   im just gonna grab a couple of these .  
this stuff is great !  
oh ,  i forgot this was in here .  umm ,  this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monicas something borrowed and its blue .   yeah 
yknow rach ,  i think that ,  i think you should be monicas maid of honor .  
you do ?  why ?  
because i think it means more to you .  
but pheebs ,  yknow you earned it .  
it &apos;s fine .  i mean ,  this is something that youve been thinking about since you were what ,  14 ?   
no ,  i was ten .  i just developed early .

 do you have any tissues ?  
okay !   
well just well just let her stay .

hey you guys ,  umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath .  
why not ?  
okay ,  im going to need a comforter ,  but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise i get very nasal .   do you have a cat ?  cause its already happening .   do you hear that ?    
why ?  
he does ?  
say again ?  
thats right .  thats right .  and that is why you cant stay here tonight .  and probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding .  
feelings ,  such strong feelings .  
 hey everybody !  happy thanksgiving !  
no ,  no ,  no .  no - no - no .  
what ,  are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year ?  
no ,  we &apos;re playing this game i learned at work .  you have to name all the states in six minutes .  
what ?  that &apos;s like insanely easy !  
now ,  that &apos;s a lot harder than it sounds .  you always forget at least one ,  or in some cases .  .  .  fourteen  .  
it &apos;s a stupid game and i wasn &apos;t playing against other people ,  so technically i didn &apos;t lose .  
what ?  you forgot fourteen states ?  
nobody cares about the dakotas .    
oh ,  okay ,  time &apos;s up !  
all right ,  i got 48 .  
oh that &apos;s not bad ,  pheebs ?  
oh ,  i got tired of naming states .  so i decided to list the types of 
okay ,  so rachel &apos;s got 48 and phoebe has the lead in vegetables ,  joey ?  
say hello to the new champ of chandler &apos;s dumb states game .  
wow ,  how many have you got ?  
hey !  how is new england not a state ?  huh ?  they have a sports team !  
does south oregon have a sports - team ?   there you go .   
 how come we have one extra place setting ?  
 &apos;cause you invited your assistant .  
oh ,  right .  sorry .  but tag &apos;s not coming; his girlfriend came into town ,  so he &apos;s spending thanksgiving with her .  
oh !  why didn &apos;t you tell me ?  i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin .  
well ,  i was going to ,  but then i figured ,  you know .  .  .  your food is so delicious and perfect ,  you can never have too many of those pumpkin things .  
now you think i wouldn &apos;t enjoy that ,  because it is so fake ,   but i still do .  
regular celery !   oh ,  i already have that .   
done !  with time - a to spare .  
oooh that may be a new world &apos;s record  
you know ,  i hate to lecture you guys ,  but it &apos;s kinda disgraceful ,  that a group of well - educated adults and joey can &apos;t name all the states .  did you ever see a map ,  or one of those round ,  colorful things called  &quot; a globe ?  &quot;  hmm ?  
uh ,  magellan ?  you got 46 states .   
what ?  that &apos;s impossible .  
46 .  wow !  who &apos;s well educated now ,  mr .  i - forgot - ten - states ?  
all right ,  i &apos;m out of oven space .  i &apos;m gonna turn on joey &apos;s .  please ,  watch him !  do not let joey eat any of the food !  
i am only one man !   okay ross ,  time is up !  
no ,  just give me another minute .  
look ross ,  if you don &apos;t know them by now ,  you will never know them ,  okay ?  that is the beauty of this game .  it makes you want to kill yourself .  
this - this is crazy !  i can do this !  all right ,  uhh ,  i bet i can get all 50 before dinner .  
okay ,  but if you can &apos;t no dinner !  
you &apos;re on !  
 all right .  don &apos;t look at my list ,  ross ,   &apos;cause there &apos;s a lot on there that you don &apos;t have .  
 hey ,  did you guys know that your oven doesn &apos;t work ?  
but the drawer full of take - out menus is okay ,  right ?  
ross ,  i &apos;m gonna use yours ,  okay ?  
pshhshhh !  
chandler ?  can you give me a hand ?   
sure ,  and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment .  
don &apos;t worry ,  chandler ,  it &apos;s not a globe of the united states .   
hey you guys i &apos;m gonna go out and take a walk .  
phoebe ,  why is your bag moving ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s not !  
seriously ,  it &apos;s moving !  
what the hell is in there ?  
rosss apartment is nice !  how come we don &apos;t hang out here more often ?  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe it &apos;s because it smells a little weird .  it &apos;s like old pumpkins or something .  
that &apos;s my pie !  
which smells delicious !  
uh - oh !  uh - oh !  
what ?  
 hi geller - bing residence .  how can i help ?  
phoebe ,  why is there a dog in our apartment ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  who &apos;s this ?  
phoebe ,  there &apos;s a dog sitting on my couch !  
tell her ,  i &apos;m allergic ,  and i will sue !  
no ,  there &apos;s no dog here ?  
yes there is !  he &apos;s black and white and shaggy and  he &apos;s sitting next to rachel and licking rachel &apos;s hand .  
oh my god !  where are you ?   
i &apos;ll be right there !  
 they &apos;re here already ?  how are they doing this ?  
i ,  uh ,  wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good .  
we kinda broke up this morning .  
yeah ,  so she went back to ohio .  
ohio !  !  thank you !  
huh !  where is the dog ?  !  
what dog ?  there - there &apos;s no dog here .  
yeah that dog left !  
 phoebe !  phoebe ,  open up !  
there &apos;s no dog in here .   
phoebe ,  we can hear the dog barking !  
no that &apos;s just me coughing !   oh ,  good ,  there you are !  listen ,  um ,  i have a dog in my room .  
what is it doing here ?  
well ,  i &apos;m watching it for some friends who went out of town .  wait .   hello ,  my name is clunkers .  may i please stay with you nice people ?  
oooh ,  i wish she could stay here ,  but chandler is allergic !  
extremely allergic ,  okay ?  if i &apos;m anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes ,  my throat will just close up !  
that &apos;s odd ,   &apos;cause this dog &apos;s been living here for the past 3 days 
 really ?  
chandler ,  if that dog &apos;s been here that long ,  and you haven &apos;t had a reaction ,  maybe you &apos;re not allergic to this dog ?  
well ,  it still has to go ,  right ?  
okay ,  it &apos;s um 
 don &apos;t do it !  
don &apos;t do what ?  
what ?  
are you crazy ?  
are you out of your mind ?  
why ?  
told ya .   
they are needy ,  they are jumpy ,  and you can &apos;t tell what they are thinking ,  and that scares me a little bit .  
right ,  they are scary .   ahh ,  she just ate a treat out of my hand !  !  !  
wait a minute .  do you not like all dogs ?  i mean ,  not even puppies ?  
you don &apos;t like puppies ?  
 okay ,  you are new !  
look ,  chandler ,  i told you ,  never tell anyone about this dog thing .  it &apos;s like ross not likin ice cream .  
you don &apos;t like ice cream ?  
it &apos;s too cold .  
okay ,  it &apos;s just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable .  
 it hurts my teeth .  
and i don &apos;t wanna say this ,  i don &apos;t want you guys to hate me ,  but uh ,  i don &apos;t think ,  i can be around that dog anymore .  okay ,  so either the dog goes ,  or i go .   oh my god !  !  
how can i not get this ?  i &apos;m a college professor; i got 1450 on my s . a . t . s .  
1250 .  
damn ,  i forgot you were here .  
all right .  we &apos;re gonna take clunkers to rosss .  we &apos;ll be back in a minute .   
oh ,  wait before you guys go ,  can i just ask you a question ?  
yeah .  
when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend ,  what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move ?  
oh ,  i &apos;d say about a month .  
really ?  i &apos;d say 3 to 4 .  
half hour .   
interesting .  
when it &apos;s your assistant ,  i would say never .  
all right ,  rach ,  the big question is ,  does he like you ?  all right ?  because if he doesn &apos;t like you ,  this is all a moo - point .  
huh .  a moo - point ?  
yeah ,  it &apos;s like a cow &apos;s opinion .  it just doesn &apos;t matter .  it &apos;s moo .  
 have i been living with him for too long ,  or did that all just make sense ?  
please ,  don &apos;t listen to joey ,  okay .  would you look at him ?  he - hes obviously depressed .  he &apos;s away from his family; he &apos;s spending thanksgiving with strangers .  what he needs right now is for you to be his friend .  
you &apos;re right ,  i &apos;m sorry .  thank you .  okay ,  that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .  
fine !  take their advice .  no one ever listens to me .  when the package is this pretty ,  no one cares what &apos;s inside .   
hey .  
not bad .  
thanks .  
a year .  on and off .  i kinda thought we &apos;d end up together .  i don &apos;t anymore .  
yeah .  
it &apos;s weird .  i always used to assume ,  that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given .  but lately it &apos;s like what if it &apos;s not .  do you ever have that feeling ?  
why ?  
you have all the answers ,  don &apos;t you ?  
hey ,  thanks for talking to me .  
well ,  what is a boss for ?  hug it out !   
what ?  
what did joey say ?  i like you back ?  
wait - wait a minute; that doesn &apos;t make any sense .  
wow .   
 oh my god !  those guys are stealing my car !   
right there !  that &apos;s my car !   hey !  !  
i can &apos;t believe this !   
okay phoebe ,  we should probably go back now .  
 please don &apos;t leave me ,  i &apos;ll be lonely .  
stop it .  stop !  okay let &apos;s go .  we can be strong .  
yeah ,  okay .   
oh my god !  did you hear that ?  she said monica !   oooh ,  i can &apos;t leave her !  
you know if you want ,  we can sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn &apos;t even know .  
that &apos;s not gonna work .  
i &apos;ve had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea .  he &apos;s not so smart .  
hey !  i didn &apos;t know either .  
yeah ,  but you kinda knew that something was going on ,  didn &apos;t you ?  
where &apos;s chandler ?  
 here i am .  
wash your hands !  !  !  
how did you know ?    
hey !  what &apos;s she doing back here ?  
relax ,  ross .  she &apos;s not made of ice cream !  
hey look ,  phoebe .  i ,  uh ,  i laid out the states geographically .  .  .  
 no ,  no ,  we don &apos;t really have time for this right now .  okay ,  we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom .  
yeah ,  but ,  but look what i &apos;m .  .  .  
see ,  this is exactly what we do not have time for .   
 where &apos;s monica ?  
um ,  in phoebe &apos;s room .  you can &apos;t go in there .  
why not ?   
monica &apos;s crying .  she &apos;s very upset about this whole clunkers thing .  
well ,  i ,  i should go in there .  
no .  no ,  no .  she doesn &apos;t want to see you right now .  
why not ?  
because you sent away the dog !  
this is ridiculous .   
oh ,  is it ?  is it ?  look ,  when monica and i were kids ,  we had a dog named rover .  and ,  uh ,  one day ,  my dad decides ,  he doesn &apos;t like dogs .  so monica and her friend phyllis take away the dog .  and that was the last time we ever saw him .  don &apos;t you see ?  this is just like that .  only with a few details changed .  
 okay ,  i &apos;m in my sweat pants .  bring on the food !   what &apos;s the matter ?  
monica &apos;s all upset ,  because i sent clunkers away .  
so ?  bring the dog back ,  you &apos;re a hero .  
yeah ,  i can be a hero ,  i could do that .  i could ,  i could do .  .  .  i ,  w - w - what if ,  what if it attacks me ?  
chandler ,  it &apos;s like a big gerbil .  
and that doesn &apos;t scare you ?   
ross ,  you need some help ?  
from you ?   yes ,  please !  
 first of all ,  utah ?  dude ,  you can &apos;t just make stuff up !  
i hate america !  when i finish this game ,  i swear i am moving .   
hey !  tag &apos;s still talking to the police .  
yeah ,  ohh !  why ,  damnit ,  why did i open my mouth ?   i have a crush on you; i am attracted to you .   gee ,  i - i know that i freaked him out 
if you said it like that ,  you probably did ,  yeah .   
 hey ,  is chandler here ?  
no ,  no he went for a walk .  
okay ,  but you cannot tell him .  .  .  but look who &apos;s back !   
 hi !  
oh no - no - no - no - no - no - no !  he went over to ross &apos; to bring the dog back here !  
oh no ,  the dog &apos;s not going to be there !  
you think ?   
hi ,  honey .  
please ,  please ,  please ,  don &apos;t be mad at me .  
what ?  why ,  why would .  .  .  
 shh ,  wait and see .  maybe we will ,  maybe we won &apos;t .  
okay ,  i went over to ross &apos; apartment to bring back clunkers .  yknow ,  for you ,  and  i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere ,  all over the apartment ,  including the roof ,  which fyi ross ,  one of your neighbors ,  growing weed .  i couldn &apos;t find him ,  and i am so ,  so ,  so ,  sorry .  but i do know where we could all go ease the pain .   
we have good news ,  look who &apos;s back !  
 hi !  
clunkers ?  !  oh my god !  
that &apos;s right ,  she came back all by herself .  
it &apos;s a thanksgiving miracle !  
 it is so good to see you !  
yeah ,  she came all the way back from ross &apos; building .  oh ,  the things she must have seen !  and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in  i went too far ,  didn &apos;t i ?  when should i have stopped ?  
okay ,  maybe this is so hard ,  because there aren &apos;t 50 states .  let me tell you something ,  i have 49 states ,  and there are no more !  i - i think ,  i should be able to eat something .  
it &apos;s up to you .   
i &apos;m okay .  i gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots .  
thanks for having me over ,  you guys .  
colorado .  
ah ,  what good are you .    
okay .  
um ,  i &apos;m not .  
no ,  you didn &apos;t .  the only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us .

ohh .  
did the girl ever let you ride it ?  
no !  but she gave me the box that it came in .  it had a picture of the bike on the front .   so i would sit on it and my step - dad would drag me around the backyard .

hey pheebs !  
hey !   
if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building ,  why not get him something a little bit more subtle ,  like a wrecking ball ,  or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway ?  
it &apos;s not just the drum noise .  every five minutes ,  joey throws his sticks in the air ,  and i have to hear ,   &quot; oh my eye !  oh god ,  my eye !  &quot;  i mean ,  it is so annoying .  
yes ,  thank you .  you see ,  this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums .

oh no !   oh !  wow !  !  !

a little bit ,  yeah .  
pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone ?

the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part !  okay ben ,  its time to light the hanukkah candles !

 it was at the front door .  when i got home .  somebody sent it to us .  
chandler ,  this is not addressed to you .  this is addressed to mrs .  braverman downstairs .   thief .  
ino !  i didn &apos;t read the box before i opened it .  and you can &apos;t return a box after you &apos;ve opened the box .  
why ,  why not ?  
because it &apos;s too delicious .  
chandler ,  you stole this cheesecake .  that is wrong .  
no - no - no !  it is going to be okay ,  because mrs .  braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win !  the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate ,   mommas little bakery .   i feel terrible ,  im a horrible ,  horrible ,  horrible person .  
all right ,  i should get going ,  big day at work .  yknow im in a coma ?  today ,  they do this test on me and it turns out im not brain dead .

what are you talking about ?  
cousin frannies wedding ,  it &apos;s tomorrow night .  
you were invited ?  !  
no .  
my god ,  i cant believe this !  i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited ,  but i thought that was it !  i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable !  
well ,  maybe since the age of 9 ,  frannies made some new friends .  
well l - look okay ,  its probably just a mistake .  let me call aunt sheryl okay ?  maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail .  
yeah ,  well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times ,  okay ?  and if i hadnt have stopped her ,  there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go to .  
yknow ,  she tried to undress me too .  
joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet ?  !  !  
umm ,  i think hes still out .  whats wrong ?  
well ,  ill tell you rachel karen green ,  i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note .   
  &quot; pheebs ,  cant make it ,  got a date .  talk to you later .  big daddy .  &quot;   big daddy ?  
oh thats a nickname we were trying out .

 hey !  
oh !  heres joseph francis !  
oh - wha - ho !  what are you middle naming me for ?  !  i left you a note !  
so what ?  !  that doesnt give you the right to ditch me !  
hey ,  you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex !  
phoebe hes right ,  that is the rule .  
i dont accept this rule .  when we make plans ,  i expect you to show up .  okay ,  i cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better !  yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go ,  but this  is for life !  
wow !  im so sorry; i had no idea it would bother you this much .  
well ,  it does .  
okay ,  can i - can i make it up to you ?  huh ?  im sorry .   how about uh ,  dinner tomorrow night ?  !  ill pay for myself !  
okay ,  you wore me down .  
hey joe ,  while youre over there how about another beer for the ross - a - tron ?  
hi !  
another cheesecake came !  they delivered it to the wrong address again !  
so just bring it back downstairs ,  whats the problem ?  
i cant seem to say goodbye .  
are you serious ?  !  chandler ,  we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more ?  
well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay ?  !  
it was cheesecake .  it was fine .  it had a buttery ,  crumbly ,  graham cracker crust ,  with a very rich yet light ,  cream cheese filling  wow !  my whole mouth just filled with saliva !  
 yknow what ?  forget it !  we are just hungry !  we have not had lunch !  we are just light - headed !  so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake .  
yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted .  
good idea .  where do you want to go to lunch ?  
awww !  mel torme died .  
joey ,  that papers like a year old !  
aw !  does that mean the sam goodys sale is over ?  !  
 hey .  
hey .  
hey .  
so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasnt a mistake .  ahh ,  theres - theres limited seating in the hall .  
limited seating ?  !   i am just one tiny person !  
well yeah ,  but she doesnt know that .  i mean ,  the last time she saw you - you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling .  
 limited seating !  oh ,  that is such a lame excuse !  thats not the reason shes not inviting me !  
oh whats the big deal ?  !  i wasnt even invited to the ceremony ,  just the reception .  and - and yknow what ?  if it makes you feel any better ,  joan and i will just make an appearance and then ,  and then well - well leave early as a sign of protest .  
joan ?  
yeah ,  joan tedeski my date .  shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department .  tall ,  very beautiful ,  and despite what some people say ,  not broad backed !  
wait a minute ,  you got ross gellar and guest ?  !  i wasnt invited and you got  &quot; and guest ?  !  &quot;  
uh - uh ,  excuse me ,  i do have to interrupt on rosss behalf .  i - i think the rule applies here yknow ,  since she has a chance to get on broad back 
 not broad backed !  
wait a minute ,  yknow ,  youre bringing me !  
what ?  i cant cancel on joan !  
why not ?  !  
becdid you not hear me ?  !  shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department ,  okay ?  theyre wild !  why do you want to come anyway ?

 its still there !   
mrs .  braverman must be out .   
she could be out of town .  maybe shell be gone for months .  
by then ,  the cheesecake may have gone bad .  we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake .  
no that could kill her .  
well ,  we dont want that .

 oh my how much do you weigh ross ?  !  
i prefer not to answer that right now ,  im still carrying a little holiday weight .   
yknow ,  when we talked about face to face ,  i dont think we thought it all the way through .  
so what do you want me to do ?  
well ,  just shimmy down me and drop !   
hi .  
hi .  
 m - maybe i should hang and you can climb down me .

its still looks pretty far !  
its not that far !  just drop !  
do not rush me !  !   
ross ,  you should know that my pants are startin to come down and im not wearing any underwear !   
that really was some of your best work .  
hm - hmm ,  i told you !   i cant believe that ive only got two hours before i call in sick for work .

do you wanna ?  
hey .  
hey .  
what are you doing ?  
well ,  yknow i was thinking of moving the couch over here .

and your lap does not count !  okay ?  come on ,  help me move this .  
no .  no .  no .  
no ?  
no .  rosita does not move .  
im sorry ,  rosita ?  as in 
as in rosita does not move .  
joey ,  its just a chair !  whats the big deal ?  
the big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and its at the perfect angle so you dont get any glare coming off of stevie .  
stevie the tv ?  
 is there a problem ?  
hey ,  yknow whats weird ?  after you guys get married ,  when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say ,   &quot; this is my brother - in - law ross .  &quot;  not ,   &quot; my friend ross ,  &quot;   &quot; brother - in - law ross .  &quot;  thats weird isnt it ?  
couldnt i just say ,   &quot; this is ross ?  &quot;  
 sure ,  do whatever you want .   
 hey ross !  so ,  i was checking out the uh ,  real estate section 
yeah ?  
look at this .   
oh ,  it looks like mom and dads house .  oh ,  it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh ,  the window in the attic is oh my god !  !  
what ?  what happened to the window in the attic ?  !  
i cant believe mom and dad are selling the house !  
i cant believe they - they didnt even tell us !  
i cant believe i still dont know what happened to the window in the attic !   
 uh ,  hello dad !  monica and i just saw the house in the paper !   yes were surprised !   who did you leave a message with ?  
joey ,  joey i am so sorry .  
i told you not to move it !  rach ,  how would you feel if say ,  i wanted to move your mom ,  and you said dont ,  and i did it anyway and her head fell off ?  
okay ,  come onjoey ,  ill buy you a new one !  all right ?  well go down to the store right now and well - well get you a new chair .  
 shes not even cold yet !  
but dont you think rosita wouldve wanted you to move on ?  i mean yknow ,  she did always put your comfort first .  
thats true .   
 okay ?  you ready ?  
i cant believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in .  man ,  some - some strangers gonna be living in my room .  
well ,  after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you ,  its time the velvet ropes came down .  
they kept your room for a while .  
oh please !  dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out !  i gotta say ,  a tanning bed and a stack of victorias secret catalogues ,  not a gym !  
come on ,  you know they love you .  
as much as they love you ?  
i was their first born !  they thought she was barren !  its not my fault .  
 hey .  
hey .  
hey !  
ugh ,  i hate this year !  
whats wrong with this year ?  
well okay ,  its already february and ive only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world !  
that was me and ross .  
oh thats right !  
hey ,  yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash ?  some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing .  
oh thats a great idea .  youre really good on the phone .  
yeah and yeah ,  and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had .  yknow ,  i probably wouldnt have to say spank as much .   
what ?  
so basically this is very easy .  you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can .  
 why dont we do a trial run .  
im the supply manager .  
we dont need any toner .  
okay ,  what was wrong with that call ?  
theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner ,  but thats okay because whatever they say ,  you can find the answer to it here in this script .  
so ,  i think youre ready to sell toner ,  do you have any last questions ?  
im here !  
hi .  god ,  it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work .  
well ,  its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling .  
im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore .  
well ,  i dont know whats in the boxes down here ,  but i do know there are six or seven easy bake ovens in the attic .  
i used to love to play restaurant .  
yeah ,  not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater .  
so ,  i think your boxes are over here .   
i dont know .  they - they must be your mothers ,  but please ,  please dont ask her .  ill throw these away .   
oh look ,  look theres your old makeup kit !  
well ,  the white seems to be untouched .   uh - oh .  
yknow how the garage floods every spring ?  
i think i accidentally used monicas boxes to keep the water away from the porsche .  
you dont secretly smoke do you ?  
i dont need any toner .  
not me .  
you wanna know why .  you wanna know why ?  
okay ,  i dont need any toner because im going to kill myself .   
okay ,  so no toner today .  thanks anyway ,  bye - bye .  
well i only have one thing to do today .  (he looks at his board in his back .  
its just that i uh ,  have been working for ten years now at this meaningless ,  dead - end job and nobody here even knows i exist !  
i - im sorry ?  
my chair .  now ,  if anybody asks ,  your name is rosita !   
you will like it !  
no i wont .   
you dont even know !  
because ,  i know what i like and what i dont like !  its not the same thing !   
well look ,  if you dont like this  
i dont know why you say that so soon .   
come on joey ,  i just bought you a new chair !  the most expensive one in the store !  hey ,  yknow what i was thinking ?  we could name her francette .  
francette ?  what is she ?  a couch ?   
poor thing .  cut down in her prime .  
joey ,  the new chair will be here in an hour .  maybe we should actually move rosita out of here .  yknow ,  start the healing process ?  
well ,  i guess youre right .  maybe ,  maybe ill take her down to the incinerator .  its gonna be so sad ,  and kinda cool .   shes healed !  
thats weird .  
no its not weird ,  its a miracle !  
its not a miracle joey !  im sure theres some explanation .  
oh there is !  if you want something enough and your heart is pure ,  wondrous things can happen !  
joey ,  i really dont 
 can you tell me how this happened ?  
well no .  
miracle !  
no ,  yknow what ?  maybe somebody came in here and fixed it !  or something !  
someone like an angel ?  
thats right joey ,  the chair angel came in and healed your chair .   
well ,  shell understand right ?  its not like i did it on purpose .  
oh my god ,  does she really thinks that ?  
well i dont know ,  i - i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously ,  you were a medical marvel !  the doctor said your mother could 
really ?  
great !  
sure !  
 this couldve been hers !  
 i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself !  
yeah ,  me too .   
hey ,  hows hows the uh ,  miracle chair ?  
fine .  
yeah ?  wow !  yknow ,  that this thing has speakers in the headrest !  
no .  really ?  
yeah !  you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio !  
 hey guy !  
no !  thats just the  &quot; hey guy &quot;  guy .  he says that to everybody !  hes the worst !  id like to take him with me !  
 yeah !  right !  
oh no .  
no ,  whatever !  anything !  
okay ,  i should ,  i should probably be getting back to my thing now .  see ya .   
hey guys !  hey !  
hey .  
 thats a good one !  do you hear that ross ?  three days !  
 yeah !  yeah !   oh ,  this will make a great memory .  
 okay .  so ,  which boxes are mine ?  
well ,  these .  these are yours right here .   
okay .   oh !  a coloring book !   
yeah .  yeah ,  oh you loved that thing .  you always had it with you .  you never went anywhere without - without that coloring book .  
 really ?  wow !  it looks like i had some trouble staying inside the lines .  
nu - uh !   
oh ,  yeah you loved that glove !  you took it every place you went .  you never went any place without that glove .  
wow !  look at this !   i cant believe i even fit into this shirt !  oh ,  this is yours .   
oh ,  i dont know how that got in there .  
 this isnt mine .   hey ,  this isnt ,  this isnt my stuff !  ugh ,  ross !   these are your boxes !  where are my boxes ?  
umm ,  your boxes are umm 
what ?  
well ,  the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes .  im sorry .  
im afraid so .  
well ,  i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche .  
there was also leaves and guk and stuff .  
hey chandler !  
hey !  
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines ,  has a rolling massage ,  and speakers in the head rest ?  
yeah ,  id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore .  
well what if i told you you can do it in my apartment ?  
 are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete ?  the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year ?  
i just purchased the la - z - boy e - cliner 3000 .   
thats awesome !  thats great !  what made you do it ?  !  
well ,  its a long story ,  but umm i broke joeys chair 
whoa - whoa - whoa !  you broke joeys chair ?  
yeah .  
i thought i broke joeys chair !  thats why i replaced it with mine !  
ohhhhh .  thats how it got fixed !  
well ,  what did you think ,  that - that elves came in and fixed it ?  
noo !   angels .  
im gettin my chair back !   
what ?  wh - hey !   
well ,  it looks like it wasnt healed after all !  yeah !  so ,  i guess this chair is mine now !   
joey you broke my chair !  !  
your chair ?  !  
yeah ,  he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs !  
so ,  there was no miracle ?  !  
no joe ,  no miracle .  
 oh no this is devastating !  my faith is shaken .  im so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life .  
uh - huh !  nice try ,  but you dont get that chair anymore !  all right ?  that is my chair now !  you can sit on my lap !   no i take that back !  
i think i should get the chair !   
how do you figure ?  
because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair !  the only one around here that hasnt broke a chair ,  is me !  
no - no - no !  this chairs not going anywhere .  
well ,  wheres the logic in that ?  !  
the logic is ,  that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half !  
so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing !   
thats right !  
what are you guys ?  like a gang or something ?  !   
yeah !  we are !   
 im right here !  !  !  !  
phoebe ?  the lady who sells toner ?  
 look ,  um i really appreciate your coming down 
why ?  !  
i thought it was toner .  
really ?  !  
how ?  
couldnt it just be a coincidence ?  
it doesnt really seem like enough to be fate .  
im actually the office manager .  
well ,  was there anything else ?  !  
philadelphia .  
 really ?  
yeah - yeah .  
 did you hear that ?  !  i dont need you guys to care about me !  because the universe cares !  the whole universe !   i really wished theyd care just a little bit though .  
oh ,  this is terrible !  everything is destroyed !  look at this .   it obviously meant enough for me to save it ,  and i dont even know what it is !  ohh ,  its still soft .   what do you think this is ?  
 how are you honey ?  
sweetheart ,  we love you just as much as ross !  now ,  im sorry about everything that happened and id probably never be able to make it up to you ,  but heres a start .   
its the key to my porsche .  well ,  the key to your porsche .  
 what ?  !  
ive been thinking about getting rid of it .  i was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window .  your mothers right ,  i do look like an ass .  
wait ,  youre giving me your porsche ,  youre kidding me right ?  !  
 why dont we take it for a spin ?  
all right !  
oh yeah .

rachel !  come on out !  monica made breakfast !  
chocolate - chip pancakes !   
weve got presents !

well ,  can i keep the presents and still be 29 ?  
come on rach !  look ,  turning thirty is not that big a deal .  
oh really .  is that how you felt when you turned thirty ?   
 why god ?  !  !  why ?  !  !  we had a deal !  !  let the others grow old !  not me !  !    
yknow ,  im still 29 in guam .  
hey ,  30 is not that old !  do you know how old the earth is ?  
late thirties ?  oh come on you guys !  is it just me ?  am i overreacting to this ?  
no rach ,  its not just you .  my thirtieth birthday certainly wasnt that much fun .   
rach ,  youre in a great place in your life .  come on ,  youve got a great job !  good friends 
yeah ,  your roommate is a soap opera star .  
look ,  yknow i know my lifes going pretty well ,  but i look around and i just see so many people whove accomplished so many other goals by the time theyre thirty .  
come on phoebe !  you can do it phoebe !  come on !  
there you go !   
come on ,  lets have some fun .  huh ?   what do you want to do today ?  
nothing .  i dont want to do anything .  
well ,  doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid ,  like ross .  
hey !  that was a practical purchase !  i needed that car for transportation !  okay ?  i - i have a child !  one of the better british sports cars ever made .  of course ,  better is a relative term .  which reminds me of a joke .  why dont the british make computers ?  because they couldnt figure out how to make them leak oil .  anyway ,  the gang is all staring at his new purchase . ] 
how hot do i look in this ,  huh ?  !  
ross ,  a sports car ?  wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there ?  
thats not what this is about okay ?  i - i am a sports car enthusiast .  i have always been into cars .  
hey ,  whats the horsepower on this thing ?  
 i dont know ,  but - but look how shiny !  
i cant believe you bought this .  
really !  god ross ,  what were you thinking ?   i know its really shallow ,  but a part of me wants him again .  
oh ,  well get in line missy .   so ,  can i have a ride stud ?  
hop in .   get ready for the smoothest ride of your life .   anyway ,  this being new york he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper ,  likewise with the car behind him .  hes completely boxed in and cant move more than two inches .  he tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no avail . ) 
damnit !   
yknow what ?  i am going to do something today .  im not just gonna sit around like some old lady .  im gonna get something pierced .  like my uh ,  like my nose or my tongue or something .  
really ?  !  cause yknow that hurts .  
look rachel ,  i know what youre going through .  im totally freaked about turning 25 .  
 get out ,  get out of my apartment .

whats - whats going on ?  phils really pissed !  
monicas wasted .  
maybe that will liven up this party .  
 okay ,  will you just go help her change please !  
okay ,  but taking care of a drunk ,  naked woman seems like a job for joey .  
 this ones from me .  
it wasnt on your list ,  but hopefully youll think its really fun .  
 a scooter !   
 stick to the list .  always stick to the list .  
no !  no - no ,  i love it .  thank you .   
okay ,  open ours next .  open ours next !  
okay .  
now that youre a couple ,  we dont get two presents from you guys ?  
for my last birthday you gave me a hug !   okay ,  read the card !  read the card !  
okay .   happy birthday grandma !  its better to be over the hill  then buried under it .   all our love monica and chandler .   thats funny ,  yeah !  
no - no - no - no !  that was the joke !  
 no ,  i know !  i get it !  its funny !  
no ,  because youre not a grandmother !  
no i know ,  because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i dont have any of those things .  thats why its so funny .   
hey !  look whos back !  its the birthday girl !  hows the birthday girl feeling ?  
well ,  i feel fine ,  but i think youre bumming out the rest of the kids .  
what ?   
okay !  yknow what ?  i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids .  all i really needed was a plan .  see i wanna have three kids 
oh let me guess ,  and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother .  
as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years .  i love this plan !  i wanna marry this plan !  
if you could do that ,  id marry the hippity - hop .  
so ,  if i wanna have my kid when im 35 ,  i dont have to get pregnant until im 34 .  which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes !  oh wait ,  but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant 
really !  that long ?  !   look all you want ,  its happening !

 ohh 
whats the matter ?  you okay ?  
yeah ,  its just yknow 
 monica said wedding .  
uh ,  so anyway ,  we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony .  
oh !  i would love to read a poem .  
do you think you could get through a poem ?  
 itll be a short one .  
okay ,  so ross will be doing the reading .  
ohhh 
okay .  yeah ,  i guess ,  i guess i could do that too .  
too ?  
yeah ,  i kind of uh ,  have something else planned for you guys .  
do you mind telling us what it is ?  
sorry ,  im kinda keeping this one on the q . t .  
well ,  whatever it is ,  i hope it involves winking .   
hey !  
so i just talked to one of the dool writers today ,  and 
what is dool ?  
oh !  !  
thats great !  
and - and - and not only that ,  im gettin a new brain !  !  
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life !  
wait ,  what do you mean youre getting a new brain ?  
oh well ,  theyre killing off one of the characters on the show ,  and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body .  
what ?  a brain transplant ?  !  
 yes ,  its a highly controversial procedure .  
its ridiculous !  
well ,  i think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months .  
 its winter ,  they are fewer people on the street .   
who are they killing off ?  
uh cecilia monroe ,  she plays jessica lockhart .  
shes my favorite character on dool .  
nice .  
she is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces ,  i mean i dont think ive ever seen her finish a beverage .  
and the way she slaps all the time !  
oh !  
wouldnt you love to do it just once ?  !   
dont do it .  
cecilia monroe man ,  what a great actress .  
oh ,  tell me about it .  and shes been on the show forever ,  its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes .  
yeah - yeah ,  help me out here ,  when you come out of the  &quot; brain transplant ,  &quot;  you are going to be her ?  
 rach ,  so ,  that guy there .  straight or gay ?  
 well ,  i &apos;d have to say gay .  
yeah ?  why ?  
well mainly because he &apos;s kissing that other guy .  
oh no not that guy there .  that guy right there .   
oh yeah he &apos;s too cute to be straight .  
 ohh knockers will help us figure it out .   
all right ,  straight ,  and not subtle .   
ohh ,  he left his cell phone .  
oh ,  well ,  we can hand it to gunther and he &apos;ll put it in lost and found .  
or we could use it to call china .  see how those guys are doing .  
what if ,  um ,  if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fall in love .  i mean wouldn &apos;t that be a great story ?  kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age .  
yeah that does sound great .  i &apos;m going to get the phone .   
what ?  wait !  why why do you get the story ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i haven &apos;t been out on a date in so long .  
phoebe ,  you had a date three days ago .  
that wasnt a date !  that was ,  that was just friends getting together  having sex .  
okay .  okay ,  see ?  i get the phone .  
no way !  no way !  you just broke with tag a week ago .  
yeah !   and until now ,  i didnt think id love again .  
nice try .  
oh hey - hey wait !  how do we fairly decide who gets the phone ?  
i dont know .   
well umm ,  maybe we could uhh  ah - ha !  too slow !  !   
cut !   
 can i get some ice here ?  !  
youre not the fan whos dying are you ?  
im supposed to meet and hug a fan who &apos;s dying ,  but thats not supposed to be until  later !  
oh that was a real person ?  !  
i - i - im leaving the show ?  
who told you that ?  
which one ?  was it bald or was it tall ?  
yknow what ?  it doesnt matter !  because it is not true !  
and if it were true ,  how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that ive been playing for 20 yearsill give you a tip !   
no phoebe !  you cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair !  okay look ,  i have an idea .  why dont we ,  why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial ,  and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him .  and then whoever does gets the phone .  
or ,  we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone .  
i dont think so .  
 fine all right ,  but id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet .  
 all right ,  first name on the speed dial is mom .  
ohh ,  i lost my mom to suicide .  
okay no way ,  you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin .  
did i use that already today ?  im sorry .  
yes okay .   well now see this isnt telling us anything .   joe .  carlos .  peter .  ooh !  peter luger !  t hats a steak house !  
okay ,  a meat eater .  fine ,  thats one for you .  
 oh ,  i win !  hes got barneys on his speed dial .  
so you dont know thats barneys the store !  that can be yknow his friends house ,  or a bar .  who has barneys the store on their speed dial ?  
what is that ?  
i think its the dying cat parade .  
it sounds like its coming from across the street .  
 oh my god !  
what ?  
yknow that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding ?  !  he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said ,   &quot; youre half scottish right ?  &quot;  
nooo !  !  
no ,  there is no way !  it can not be ross !   unbelievable !  why is your family scottish ?  !  
why is your family ross ?  !  
he cannot play at our wedding !  i mean everyone will leave !  i mean come on ,  that is just noise !  its not even a song !  
hi pheebs !

umm pheebs ,  remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that i was going to keep the uh ,  the cute guys cell phone ?  
yeah .  
and remember how i said i was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang i could just pick it up ?  
yeah !  
and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone ?  !  
ooh ,  now you lost me .  
you stole the phone !  
no i didnt !  
no ?  so youre saying that if i called it ,  it wouldnt ring ?  
no .  umm ,  okay .  but while you dial ,  let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag .   oh ,  it does work !   
phoebe !  
that is a different phone .  
oh is it ?  !   uhh ,  hello ?   yes hi ,  is rachel there ?   yes she is ,  just one moment please .   its for me !

 shhh !  im on a call !   umm well yeah ,  you can pick it up tonight ,  say ?  at - at my apartment .  its umm ,  its umm 5 morton street ,  apartment 14 ,  umm and then maybe yknow after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever .   okay ,  well okay ill see you then .   bye .   
you do know that i will be here when he comes over .  
oh ?  and how will you know what time to come over ?  
you just said it !  
oh .  okay ,  well i - i was kinda hoping that i would just be alone yknow to think about my mom and her suicide .  
oh phoebe !  
what ?  !  thats the first time today !  
 im 16 .  
 youre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show .  they dont know exactly when its going to happen ,  but apparently it &apos;s going to be very soon and thats it .  
yeah ,  thanks .  
oh youre right .  thank you !  whats your name again ?  
 im having a conversation here !   you were saying ?  
all right joey ,  i will help you .  not because i - i owe it to this stupid show ,  but because i owe it to jessica .  
youre so welcome .  
is that supposed to be me ?  
yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent .  
well ,  i feel like a snack !  
do you want some shortbread ?  eh thats scottish like you are .  
oh no thanks .  i dont like anything from my scottish heritage .  
what ?  !  
well its just my entire family was run out of scotland by vikings .  anyway ,  lots of bad memories .   
oh well ,  it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh ,  rediscover its scottish roots .  
no !  no - no theyre not .  theyre still very angry !  but yknow chandler is also half - swedish .  you know what the swedish people are famous for ?  sitting down and being quiet .  
well yeah - yeah the scottish history is so much more 
 you can not play bagpipes at the wedding !  !  
how did you know about that ?  !  
we heard you play all the way from your apartment !  
were you the ones called the cops ?  !  
thats not really important right now .  what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture ,  we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .  
why not ?  
because we hate them .  
come on thats not fair !  i mean you havent even heard me play !  
we have heard you play .  
so ,  the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence .  so ,  when jessica enters a room for instance ,  she owns everything and every person in that room .   you try .  
no ,  he already knows that he owns everything in the room !  hes not finding it out for the first time !  so ,  try it again .  
right .  hes not angry at the room either .  try it again ,  he owns it !  he owns the room .  it is his .  he owns ,  owns ,  owns ,  owns the room !  he owns it !  !   all right ,  its a little weird ,  but its getting better .   oh well ,  im gonna miss this woman so much .  i dont know what im going to do !  i mean ,  its been 20 years of my life .  
i am .  i am ,  but i dont know ,  you know .  an actor of a certain age is not that easy .  
i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in ,  but yknow i just got so comfy here !  and ohh ,  i turned down some amazing work !  
well ,  lets just say if i left 15 years ago ,  the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today !  
but well now ,  nows a different time for me .   
 you think im hot ?  
oh yeah - yeah ,  we should get the  so when jessica kisses a man ,  she usually puts umm ,  both her hands on the mans face .   
no !  its because that way the camera only sees her !   do you wanna try it ?  
hi !  its tom ,  im here to pick up the phone .   
whoa !  why do you get to answer the door ?  
well why shouldnt i ?  !  
because its my apartment !  
well ,  then i get to give him the cell phone .

 what are you guys talking about ?  
well umm ,  we were just talking about the yknow ,  the swing kings and just wondering whether yknow ,  they were the right way to go .  
yeah ,  i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh ,  two months later the couple got divorced .  and now im not saying that theres any connection here yknow ,  but they did tell me thats why they got divorced .  
but i love swing music !  
yeah but the swing kings ?  yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsthey just stop living .  
look all i know is when monica and i went to see them ,  we had fun !  and theres another reason too .  
well ,  what is the other reason ?  
i dont want to say .  
well you have to because maybe its stupid .  
well its just while monica and i were dancing to them it was the first time i knew that you were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with .  
oh great !  
is your back feeling better ?  
oh yeah its fine .  i guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasm out of control .

so youve just married the one time then ?  
youve been married twice ?  
you said the waiter ate my crab cake .

okay .  sorry .   
hey !  what did you decide to do about the movie ?  
i dont know !  its not like its porn !  this is a serious ,  legitimate movie .  yknow ?  and the nudity is really important to the story .  
thats what you say about porn .  
youre right .  maybe i shouldnt even go on the call back .  
no !  no you should !  a lot of major actors do nude scenes !  i mean ,  the chance to star in a movie ?  come on !  
well thats true .  and i am only naked in one scene .  plus it sounds really great .  my characters catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl .  who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm .  so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other .  its really sweet and - and tender .  
well ,  when can we have this shower ?  
she has got so much going on we - we have only two options .  we have friday 
well thats only two days away .  what is the other option ?  
yesterday !  
well if we make it yesterday ,  woo - hoo !  were done !  
oh my god ,  phoebe ,  this is impossible !  we cant do this by friday !  we have to find a place .  we have to invite people !  we have to get food !  theres just too much to do !  its impossible !  we cant do it !  we cannot do it !  we cannot do it !  
rachel ,  calm down !  
 okay .  im sorry .  youre right ,  youre right .  
 just calm down woman !  
phoebe ,  i already ,  i already did .  
oh okay .  all right ,  then i need to calm down a little .  
okay .  okay .   i think we can do this if we just get organized .  all right ?  we have two days to plan this party .  we just need to make fast decisions !  okay ?  all right ,  where are we gonna have it ?  
uh ,  here .  what time ?  
4 oclock .  food ?  
finger sandwiches and tea .  
ooh great !  very monica .  
and chili !  
ah you went one too far .  uh ,  flowers or balloons ?  
both !  
were paying for this yknow .  
neither .  
okay .  umm ,  what should we do for the theme ?  
lusts of the flesh .  
 what ?  
hey !  
hey !  
yknow im - im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding .  
oh boy ,  me too !  
yknow i was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours 
yeah ?  
technically we could have sex again .  what do you think ,  bossy and domineering ?  !  
the wedding is off ,  sloppy and immature !  
thats me !  come on !  
okay .   but wait ,  we cant .  my cousin cassie is in the guest room ,  were supposed to have lunch .  
well ,  get rid of her ,  obsessive and shrill .  
i thought i heard voices .  you must be chandler .  
nice to meet you too .  
yeah .   
 chandler !  
 cassie needs to stay at your place .  
whatwhy ?  
because purvy perverson over here cant stop staring at her .  
what ?  !  chandler ,  shes our cousin !  
i was not staring at her .  okay ?  i was just listening intently .  its called being a good conversationalist .  watch .   say something .  
you were staring about eight inches south of there .  
fine ,  she can stay at my place .  by the way ,  what - what does cassie even look like now .  
she looks exactly like aunt marilyn .  
umm ,  so this aunt marilyn is - is - is - is she coming to the wedding ?  
hey ,  im back !  
uh so ,  will - will i be reading the same scene again ?  come down here today .  
oh great !  yknow i wouldve been perfect for this part ,  but whatever !  yknow ,  thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie !  good day !   director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it .  
and scene !  huh ?  wasnt that fun ?  we did a little improv there .  yeah !  okay !  so you - you - you - you were saying ?  part and wants to meet you tomorrow .  
wow !  sure !  thats great !  
yeah !  yeah sure ,  just so long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold .  its really important to the_director that everything in this movie is authentic .  yeah ,  and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish .  so  
so what ?  that part be authentically ,  anatomically not jewish .  do you know what im saying ?  
yes !  
no .  what ?  be 
so to get this part you cant be ?  
nope .  
but you are ?  
yep .  
but you told them you werent ?  
thats right .  
wow !  wow !  and its definitely all gone ?  theres nothing there to work with ?   what were you thinking ?  
i dont know !  i really want this part !  and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes .  like if - if they want you to ride a horse ,  you tell em you can !  and just figure out how to do it later .  
joey !  this is not like learning to ride a horse !  this is like learning to grow a turtleneck !  
i kn - i know !  i know !  okay ?  and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the_director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like .  
oh my god ,  what are you gonna do ?  !  
i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part .   
unless !  
unless what ?  
well ,  this may sound crazy ,  but there maybe something we could fashion .  
like what ?  
hey !  ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower .  okay ,  we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is everyones individual birth stone .  
okay .  okay .  all right ,  you take care of that .  and meanwhile ,  the party is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list .  
okay .  okay !  well okay ,  who do we know thats coming ?  me .  are you ?

is it her fault that some of them didnt make it to you ?  
well ,  what am i going to say ?  
i dont know .  just uh ,  just tell em it was a mix - up with the invitations ,  orno - no - no !  blame it on the post office .  they hate the post office .  and the irish !  but i dont think you can blame it on them ,  so

its kind of an important one !  
oh ,  yknow - yknow what ,  i was looking at it upside down .

hey !  
hey !  
hey uh mon ,  i saw the porsche parked out front ,  can i get the keys ?  thought id take that bad boy out for a little spin .  
wait a minute !   you let ross drive the porsche and when i ask you ,  you say youre the only one whos allowed to drive it .  
yeah ,  well hes my brother !  and plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it .  
its a car monica !  not a rocket ship !  
whatever ross !  just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after youre done .  
 hey !  
hey !  
hey !  
saw the porsche out there mon ,  lookin good .  when do i get to take that baby out again ?  
 you let joey drive it ?  !  
ive never driven it !  okay ?  not once !  okay once .  okay ,  i drive it all the time .  
nice work everybody !  so much for the yknow ,   &quot; you can drive it ,  but dont tell rachel &quot;  plan !  
wow !  i cant believe you lied to me .  
okay ,  i can fix this !  okay monica ,  rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding .   
great !  well rachel ,  the reason why i wont let you drive the porsche is because youre a terrible driver .  there !  that wasnt about the wedding .  
look rach if - if you want to go for a ride in the porsche ill be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block .  
whew !  that was a brisk ride !  
take the top down did ya ?  
only way to fly .   
come on ross give me the keys !  monica does not know what shes talking about !  i am an excellent driver !  
youre fast and irresponsible .  that adds up to a bad driver .  
well in high school ,  that added up to head cheerleader .   
did you see the look that girl just gave me ?  huh ?  she mustve seen me cruising in the bad boy .  
i think shes checking out your beehive ross .  
what ?  !   give - give me a brush .  
gimme the keys !  
no way !  
well no brush !  
fine !  yknow what ?  it doesnt matter ,  because ,  if i remember correctly ,  there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom .   
chandler ,  we still havent gotten an rsvp from your dad .  
oh !  right .  umm ,  maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation .  
chandler !  hes your father; he should be at the wedding .  
i dont even know the man .  okay ?  were not that close .  i havent seen him in years .  
well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked ?  !  
well he doesnt have to know !  its not like we run in the same circles .  i hang out with you guys ,  and he stars in a drag show in vegas .  
ooh ,  i think i wanna trade circles .  
trust me ,  you dont want him there either .  okay ?  nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back - less dress .  
so what !  as long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil i dont care .  
ahhh !   ooh ,  nice !   
my god !  
what do you think youre doing ?  !  
just washing the windshield .   
there is no way i am letting you drive this car !  so why dont you just hand over the keys ?  
oh .  of the steering wheel .  does anyone know why that is ?  its a tradition left over from porsches racing history .  the worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans .  which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday .  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track .  at the start of the race ,  the drivers would run across the track ,  get in the car ,  buckle up ,  start the car ,  and drive off .  porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took .  since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel ,  that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat - belts ,  put the car in gear and start it .  the drivers left hand did nothing .  porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24 - hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat - belts with his right hand .  thats why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel . } 
no ah - ah - ah !  do not start this car !   okay !  okay !  i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now !   
look ross ,  if youre so freaked out ,  just get in the car !  
with you ?  !  yeah right !  
all right .   
 okay !  okay !  okay !   
what are you doing ?  !  get in the front !  
in the death seat ?  !  !  
hey guys !  
hey !  
ready to go ?  
 wait a minute !

no you didnt .  oh and honey ,  just so you know ,  now that youre marrying me ,  you dont get to win anymore .  
look forget it okay ?  i dont want to go .  i dont want to see him .  i dont wanna .  
chandler ,  look i - i know that your dad embarrassed you .  i know 
no - no all kids are embarrassed by their parents ,  youd have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through .  when i was in high school ,  he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet .  yknow its hard enough to be fourteen .  youre skinny .  youre wearing speedosthat your mom promised that you would grow into !  and you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda .  he was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack !  
hey ,  the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on !  okay ?  thats a ,  thats a pretty great dad .  
he had sex with mr .  garibaldi !  
whos mr .  garibaldi ?  
does it matter ?  !  
chandler ,  youre not fourteen anymore .  okay ?  maybe its time that you let that stuff go .  if your fathers not at your wedding youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life .  
yeah o - okay ,  but im just doing this for you .  
yes !  
so i really never get to win anymore ?  
pheebs !

i know .  they were mine .  
oh .   no !  no wait ,  thats weird !  
no ,  its not !  we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on .  
thats weird !  
im wearing his briefs right now .  
thats kinda hot .  
i think so too .  and that little flap ?  great for holding my lipstick .  
yeah ,  i wouldnt know about that .  
and !  yknow what jake says ?  that womens underwear is actually more comfortable .  and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin .  
yeah well next thing you know ,  hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture !  
there is nothing wrong with jake !  okay ?  he is all man !  im thinking even more than you .  
oh yeah ,  he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys .  
im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear !  i dont think you could ever do that .  
hey !  i am secure with my masculinity .  
okay ,  whatever .  
god .  i forgot how much i love driving .  i have got to get my license renewed .

umm im never gonna getting married !  
yeah you will !  the right guy is just around the corner !  okay ,  are we done with that ?  
no monica !  im serious !  oh ,  maybe i should just forget about it .  become a lesbian or something .  
any woman would be lucky to have ya .  
well maybe it would make me feel better if i slept with joey .  
joey ,  you gotta stay until the end .  we cant stop filming just for you .  its not like its your wedding .   
what ?  !  
what kind of surgery ?  !  
but youre supposed to work on monday .  
but youre not bald .  
look joey ,  theres nothing i can do .  besides ,  youre probably gonna be out by four anyway .  weve just got one short scene .  its just you and richard ,  and god knows hes a pro .  youll be fine .   morning richard .  
im wearing two belts .  
no !  
we are never gonna find him !  hes one guy in a huge city !  
oh my god !  is that him ?   
that is an old ,  chinese woman !  
he could be in disguise ,  yknow .  
aw ,  yknow yknow ,  maybe were - were just approaching this all wrong .  if youre chandler and - and you wanna hide ,  where is the last place on earth people would think youd go ?   
so this is your office ?  
how did you guys find me ?  i knew i shouldve hid at the gym !  
what the hell are you doing ?  !  
panicking !  and using the internet to try to prove that im related to monica .  how is she ?  
shes fine .  she doesnt know youre gone .  and she doesnt have to know ,  okay ?  now come on ,  were going home .  
no !  no !  no !  i cant do that !  
why not ?  !  
because if i go home ,  were gonna become the bings !  i cant be the bings !  
whats wrong with being the bings ?  
the bings have horrible marriages !  they yell .  they fight .  and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games !  
chandler ,  have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room ?  
no .  
then you are neither of your parents !  
its not just their marriage !  i mean ,  look at yours .  look at everybodys !  the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman !  and ive met me; i am not paul newman .  i dont race cars !  i dont make popcorn !  none of my proceeds go to charity .  
but look chandler ,  right now no - one has a lower opinion of you than i do .  but i totally believe you can do this .  
i want to .  i love her so much ,  but im afr its too huge .  
yknow ,  okay .  youre right .  it is huge .  so why dont we take it just a little bit at a time ?  okay ?  umm ,  forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it .  can you just come home and take a shower ?  
well yeah ,  but then 
 yeahno - but - but - but - but !  were just gonna go home and take a shower .  now ,  thats not scary right ?  
the nights are the hardest .   but then the day comes !  and thats every bit as hard as the night .  and then the night comes again 
 the days and nights are hard !  i get it !  okay ?  look umm ,  rachel im sorry !  i have to start getting ready !  im getting married today !  
i know .  at dusk .  thats such a hard time for me .

action .  
where the story was that i was anticipating that i would be around to hear my sons first words spoken .  but the scene was about that he wasnt supposed to be able to speak and ,  uh for some reason when we started doing the show  
hi !  were visiting !  
yay !  
da da .   
da da .  
yeah ,  shes trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place ,  and were sitting there eating pizza and i think it was you  that said  
i think i was supposed to say ,   &quot; i dont know ,  &quot;  and go over and open the door .  and i went  
what do i smell ?  
 and then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with a straight face .   
le blanc .   
what do i smell ?  
but audiencesyou have a live studio audience and they must love that .  they must love it when they see you guys playing .   
what are you guys doing ?   
nothing .  
i - i heard some of you guys talking about this earlier ,  but sometimes theres just a word that someone has to say that youll get hung up on .  and itll justthe way you say the word is funny to everybody else .   
action !  
you - you mentally make a flag on it and you say ,   &quot; okay show night ,  im justill never be able to get through this .  &quot;   
are you saying that you dont want to get with this ?  
you see ,  i dont say

in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant ?  
hey !  yknow ,  sometimes you can do everything right ,  everyone can wear everything theyre supposed to wear ,  and one of those little guys just gets through !  
how ?  
i dont know !  maybe they have tools .  
well i - i talked to and uh ,  shes definitely going to have this baby .  yknow ,  she said she was gonna raise it on her own .  
well ,  maybe thats ,  maybe thats really brave .  
maybe .  i just hope she realizes how hard its gonna be .  
maybe she hasnt really thought it through that well .  
well ,  theres a lot to think about .  i mean ,  how is she ,  how is she going to handle this financially ?  how is she going to juggle work ?  does she realize shes not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years ?  
 i dont know .  
are you okay ?  
champagne ?

look ,  it was accident !  okay ?  i - i feel bad that it happened ,  but i swear ,  i didnt even watch it !  anyway ,  here .   i thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself .

dont you see ?  its the perfect crime !  
she mustve been planning this for years !  
i will prove it to you !  okay ?  about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch .  now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain !  
honey ,  isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair ?  
i guess .  
so ,  shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go snooping around her crotch ?  
fine .  im just glad i didnt give her my secret ingredient .  
out of curiosity ,  what is your secret ingredient ?  
come in ,  im so glad youre here .  
sorry ,  i just saw ursula .  i had to give the engagement ring back .  
just seeing her brought it all back .  all the lies ,  the way she used me .  i just i got so angry just looking at her  face .  
im sorry .  i just when i look at you i see her .  when i see her i get a little bit angry .  
no wait !  theres only a problem when i look at you .   oh i got it !  i got it .

no room ?  its a baby .  its like this big .   yknow ,  i mean you - you could you could put it over here .   or - or - or we could put it right here .   aw ,  its cute ,  right ?  or - or we could put it over here .   you wouldnt even notice it .  wheres the baby ?   
honey ,  its not just a matter of where you put it .  i mean a baby changes everything .  they cry all the time .  i mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when theres a screaming baby around .  
i could use a challenge !  its getting pretty easy .  
honey ,  its so sweet that you want me to stay ,  but i - i cant do that to you .  i mean it would disrupt your entire life .  
i love living with you so much .  i just wish things didnt have to change .  
i know .  
yknow i blame ross for this .  
i do too a little bit .  
oh no ,  stay here well keep doing this .  ill pay you .  
absolutely .   i love the way you kiss .

fine .   shes wearing my bra !  
oh dear god !  
my pink flowered bra !  i recognize the strap !  
and yet you dont recognize that youre crazy .  
heres the plan !  okay ?  im going to leave you get a look at brendas bra !  
heres another plan no !  
i would do it but she thinks im attracted to her !  
why ?  
did you not hear where my head was ?  come on !  come on were a team !  were in this together !  
i fear a jury will see it the same way !  
do this for me !  come on ,  i catch you looking at womans breasts all the time !  
you see that ?  
do you see this ?   
all right .  yes .  okay .  i get your point .  but if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment ?  !  
yes !  absolutely .  okay ?  look ,  youll know its mine because on the right cup ,  the lacey part ,  theres a very noticeable rip .  
its not looking good .  
thats so sweet .   would you like to come in and say good - bye ?  im sure it would mean a lot to her .

maybe monicas playing a joke on ya .  yknow ?  getting her own husband a hooker ,  thats pretty funny .  
that is funny ,  maybe for my birthday shell murder someone .  
do you mind if i smoke in here ?  
how could you have kept all of this from me ?  
but what ?  !  you figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped rachel !

yeah .  
i mean he was possessive ,  he was jealous ,  he could never just let the little things go !  
trying to date this woman .

yknow ,  i - i - i just i dont want to get in the middle of something so complicated .  
i know ,  i get it ,  but mona ,  what relationship is not complicated ?  i mean we all have our baggage !  you must too !  why else would you still be single ?   i am so gonna leave right now .

 just because youre not in love with the guy you cant 
 wow ,  you told your dad the truth .  
about an hour ago .  
wanna go see a movie ?  
 theres gonna be a wedding !   thats unacceptable rachel !  what the hell does love have to do with it anyway ?  !  there are more important things in a marriage other than love !   constantly thinking about things !  you have to think about the consequences of your decision .   
hey rach listen ,  did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back .  
 oh my god !  let me see that !   
 you fall for it every time !  
 hey !  
hi !  
i brought you my old maternity clothes !

 oh good youre all here .  thanksgiving tomorrow ,  four oclock .   oh ,  guess who i invited .  remember that guy will colbert from high school ?

he was in rosss class marching band kinda overweight ?  well ,  really overweight .  i mean i was his thin friend .  
wow !  i dont remember him .  honey ,  are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend .  
no that was jarred !  wow !  i havent thought about him in a long time  anyway ,  umm wills ,  wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so i invited him here .  
oh thats nice .  
oh ,  and by the way ,  hes lost a bunch of weight .  i mean he looks goo - ood !  okay ,  i mean really ,  really gorgeous !   i still love chandler .  
i just want you to say it once in a while .  
all right okay ,  just so you know ,  im not gonna make a turkey this year .  
what ?  !  
well phoebe doesnt eat turkey 
phoebe !  
turkeys are beautiful ,  intelligent animals !  
no theyre not !  theyre ugly and stupid and delicious !  
all right !  okay ,  its just phoebe .  wills still on a diet ,  chandler doesnt eat thanksgiving food ,  and rachels having her aversion to poultry .  
she is ?  
remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken ?  
yeah .  but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table .  
anyway ,  it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people .  okay ?  its a lot of work .  
but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving !  i mean ,  thanksgiving with no turkey is like - like fourth of july with no apple pie !  or friday with no two pizzas !  
all right fine !  if it means that much to you !  but justtheres gonna be a ton left over .  
no there wont !  i promise i will finish that turkey !  
all right ,  youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting ?  
hey ,  isnt weird to think about how next year at this time theyll be a little baby at the table ?   rachels !  but good to know where youre at !  
 hey !  
hey !  
happy thanksgiving !  
you too !  
anything i can do to help ?

we started a rumor .

oh ,  come on will !  just take off your shirt and tell us !  
ross !  
it was no big deal .  we - we said that the rumor was that umm you had both male and female reproductive parts .  
thats right !  we said your parents flipped a coin ,  decided to raise you as a girl ,  but you still had a hint of a penis .  
 oh my god !  
you started that ?  !  
what ?  !  you heard that ?  !   
everyone at our school heard it !  
everybody at my school heard it !  you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island ?  !  
oh no !  !  !  !  oh my god !  !  this is all making so much sense to me now !  this is why adam carter wouldnt go out with me !  this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region !   
actually ,  billy tratt is gay now .  so - so that ones not really our fault .  
monica ,  how come you never told me this ?  !  
i thought it might be true .  and i was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me .   
joey stop staring !  theres nothing there !  its not true !  
im afraid im gonna need proof .  
oh !   the turkey ,  until he turns the plate around and reveals he only ate one side . ] 
you are my everest .  
joey ,  you dont have to finish that .  
oh yes i do .  otherwise whats next ?  today im just a guy who cant finish a turkey ,  but tomorrow im the guy who eats half a powerbar ,  wraps up the rest ,  and puts in the fridge ?  no !  no ,  i just i justi gotta change my pants .   jeans have no give .

  &quot; dear rach ,  youre a great person .  sorry about your tiney - wienie .  &quot;

ohh ,  theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually .  
oh !   wow !  
she didnt photograph well !  
well ,  she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings !  
so how did this happen ?  did she ,  did she lure you to an early bird dinner ?  
i was working late in the library one afternoon .  it was just the two of us .  she needed some help with her word jumble .  and one thing led to another .  if you must know ,  anita was very gentle and tender .  may she rest in peace

shame on you !  ugly baby judges you !  
okay ,  but ross just listen to me 
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  dont tell me !  i dont want to know !  
but i couldnt even if i wanted to ,  because i dont know !  i swear; i didnt see anything ,  and i dont want to know !  it was just a momentary lapse .  
momentary lapse .  dont - dont you have any self - control ?  
hello ?  
im in the bathroom ,  can you come in here ?  i think theres something wrong .  
you know what ?  i - i think ill wait out here .  
im in the bathtub .  
oh .   whats wrong ?  
i drew my own bath ,  but i did it wrong !  the waters tepid .  the salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places .  and the scents i used dont compliment each other .  eucalyptus and chamomileoh !  
what ?  
the bath salts !  theyre starting to effervesce !  its different .   its interesting .  
okay ,  lets talk about something else .  
yeah !  sure ,  sure .  so ,  what was going on with you today ?  oh - oh - oh !  
well ,  i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey .  he was talking about rules and right and wrong and 
i had the exact same conversation .  
you did ?  what was he talking about ?  
i dont know !  joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth !  
 that was a long night .  
all right ,  lets break this down .  what exactly did he say to you ?  
okay ,  he was talking about rules .  
uh - huh .  
umm ,  and looking at people differently .  
he didnt say anything about that to me .  
what did he tell you ?  
he was asking all these questions about you ,  me ,  and london .  and ,  of course the glue that holds this all together ,  the rules .  
okay .  so you ,  me and london .  looking at people differently .  maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone .  
but what did he mean by rules ?  
wait a minute !  he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in !  
because he was looking at her differently .  
and phoebe is his friend ,  so he thinks that would be breaking the rules !  
my god !  he wants to do it with phoebe in london !  
 you guys ?  
just a minute !   thats mrs .  tribbiani !  
you dont say anything .  
why would i say anything ?  that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives !  and they would have me to thank ,  and we could all start having babies ?  
im not going to let you say anything .  
you just stay here !   
oh ,  god !   
oh ,  hey ,  monica ,  i brought back your iron .  
oh ,  you had that ?  
uh - huh .  
i thought i lost it .  i got a new one ,  like ,  a month ago .  
oh ,  just as well ,  i broke this one .   
what ?  
nothing .  
okay .  
i mean ,  i - i ,  i really shouldnt say .  i mean ,  im really not supposed to .  
fine .  
its a humdinger !  
then its really too bad that you cant tell me .  
somebody likes you !  
 is it chandler ?  
no !  
well ,  then tell him to stop staring !  
its joey !  
really ?  !  joey ?  !  you dont say .  
is it something youd be interested in ?  
i dont know ,  i dont know ,  i dont know .  you know ,  i mean ,  on the one hand ,  mother may i ?  but yknow on the other hand no .  no ,  i cant .  were friends .  no ,  oh ,  no .  i dont want to risk what we have .  
i guess that makes sense .  so ,  you think youre going to talk to him ?  
sure ,  yeah .  i mean ,  its joey .  i dont want him to get hurt .  well ,  i must say ,  i am on fire !  first chandler ,  now joey !  
not chandler ,  just joey .  
hey .  
hey .  
you know what ?  ive been thinking about it .  im really coming around on the name ruth .  i think i would actually consider naming our child that .  
rach ,  i - i cant tell you how - how much that means to me !  ohh wait a minute .  wait a minute .  you - you hated the name ruth !  why - why would you change your mind ?  unless ,  you know were never going to have to use it .  you did see the folder .  you know its a boy !  
i didnt see anything !  i actually changed my mind about the name .  
i dont think so !  youre just giving me ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy ,  and thats when youll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia .  
i wouldsequoia ?  
veto .  
fine .  
unless  you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl ,  and you really do want her to be named ruth !  well ,  im not falling for that !  okay ?  ruth is off the table !  
but ross ,  you want the name ruth !  
hey .  
hey .  well ,  whats up ?  
umm ,  joey ,  i know .  
what ?  
i knooow .  
whaaat ?  
i know about your feelings .  
oh my god .  you do ?  
yes ,  and im sorry .  i - i know things worked out for chandler and monica ,  but thats very rare .  
i know .  i know .  and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys .  i mean ,  its rachel for god sakes .  
for god sakes ,  its rachel !  
i know .  i know .  and shes not only my friend; shes my pregnant friend !  shes my pregnant friend whos ross ex !  
yeah thats rachel .   beat me over the head with it .  
what am i going to do ?  you know ,  and i keep ,  i keep trying to get rid of these feelings ,  yknow ?  i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i dont like about her .  you want to hear it ?  
yeah .  
she made me switch to light mayo .  thats it !  thats all i got !  and ,  you know what ?  it tastes the same and my pants fit better !  
joey ,  i just think youre getting worked up over nothing .  this is probably just a crush .  
you think ?  
absolutely !  yknow ,  you get this rush of feelings ,  but then it goes away .  
yeah ,  just a crush !  thats all this is !  its a crush !  im joey; i dont get deep feelings .  
thats right ,  there you go !  crushes happen all the time !  i know ive had them for all you guys .  well ,  except for ross and chandler .  and im sure youve had them for us .

i dont know .  ooh ,  i bet its richard .  
why would monica be keeping richard in here ?  
well off the top of my head uhh ,  maybe shes having her cake and eating it too .  you being the cake and richard being the too .  or !  
and here we go 
i saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it ,  and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh .  yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy !   stupid closet full of bugs !  
joey .  joey ,  something feels weird and not good weird .  i dontwhoa !  !   
oh hey whoa - whoa ,  dont worry .  okay .  when my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book ,  it was always nothing .

okay .  oh godow ! oo !  
hey !  so ?  mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall .  
hmm ,  mild discomfort .  so i take it youve had one of these braxton thingies ?  
so but everything is normal .  
and - and theres no danger to her and the baby ?  are ,  but shes fine .  
thank you doctor .   oh thank you for being so nice and calm .

yes !  yes !  i got half a mind to contract that doctors uterus though .  mild discomfort ,  whats he talking about ?  
 oh hey - hey !  
 is everything okay ?  
yeah ,  everythings fine !  
your page said come to the hospital ,  what ?  what was it ?  what happened ?  
something called braxton - hicks contractions .  
oh .  oh .  thank god ,  most women dont even feel them .  
okay ,  no uterus ,  no opinion .  
hey uh ,  whats with the candy ?  
oh when you beeped me i was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater .  
oh you went to the movies by yourself ?  
no imona !  
oh ,  i gotta go back in there .  
what ?  why ?  whats wrong ?  
no ,  everythings fine .  i just gotta go back 
no really ,  you tell me whats up .  
i - i forgot my underwear .   
 so ,  thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital .  
oh hey ,  dont worry about it man .  dont worry about it ,  no big deal .  
yeah but still ,  i mean it shouldve been me .  im the dad .  on braxton - hicks .   oh and by the way ,  you did the right thing by bringing her in .  youre gonna make a wonderful father .  
there has got to be a way !  
easy there captain kirk .  oh ,  do you have a bobby pin ?  
yeah .   oh no wait ,  im not an nine - year - old girl .  
then why do you throw like one ?  
maybe monica has a bobby pin .  
sure .   &quot; monica .  &quot;  
so ,  hows the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming ?  
uh ,  really good .  really good .  yeah ,  i should be ready to kill myself any day now .   wow ,  you sure found that quick .   i justi wish i didnt feel this way about rachel anymore ,  yknow ?  i wish things could go back to normal .  i mean ,  i love living with her and god ,  helping out with the baby is just amazing ,  but now i think i think ross feels left out .  yknow ?  when i had to take rachel to the hospital ,  the doctor thought i was the father .  god you shouldve seen the look on rosss face .   by the way ,  i have no idea what im doing here .  for all i know im just locking it more .  oh hey ,  did you try opening it with a credit card ?  
thats a good idea .  
yeah .  
okay .   so uh ,  ross is kinda bummed huh ?  
oh ,  i just i feel terrible .  
hey .  
hey .  
i gotta tell you ,  yesterday was amazing .  that massage felt so good !

600 .  
whats going on ?  
oh ,  you make sex noises when you get massaged !  
what ?   
yeah ,  and it really freaked me out !  and after a while i even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on .  
what ?  !  youre crazy !  theres nothing sexual about the noises i make !  
really ?  theres nothing sexual about this ?   oooh .  oo god !  ohh .  ohhhh .  ohh .   what are you looking at ?  !   i mean hi .  
oh mythis is so embarrassing .  oh my god ,  im never gonna get massaged again !  
no ,  you cant let this stop you from getting massages !  no look ,  i have ,  i have lots of clients that make the same noises you do !  
really ?  !  
well not clients ,  lovers .  but lets just yknow ,  try it again .  come back and - and well work through it .  
are you sure ?  
yes .  
i guess .  
hey ross !  check it out !  i learned a new trick !  
hey uh ,  i brought you some lunch .  
ohh !  thats so sweet of you !  oh yum !   did you put pickles on this ?  
well yeah !  
oh ross !  !   
what ?  !  what ?  !  rach what ?  !  
whats going on ?  
i made her favorite ,  tuna salad with pickles .  
pickle ?  pickles make her sick .  giving her pickles is like giving me salad .  
 i - im sorry rach ,  i didnt know .  are you gonna be okay ?  
yeah ,  ill be fine .  but could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when i get out there ?  
im on it !   
i cant believe this !  i shouldnt be the one making her throw up !  
dude relax !  it could happen to anyone .  
yeah ?  not to you ,  because you know this stuff .  i dont know any of it and im the father .  i wish id be more involved yknow .  
 well ,  if anyone is keeping score ,  i no longer eat tuna .  
hey uh ,  can i ,  can i talk to you guys for a second ?  
yeah .  
whats up ?  
uh ,  sit down .  i wanna talk about our situation .  
 are you breaking up with us ?  
the thing is cause i live with rachel im here for a lot of the stuff ,  okay ?   and ross ross is missing everything .  so 
yeah ?  
maybe you two should live together .  
are you asking me to move out ?  do you not want me here ?  
oh no - no ,  no - no i love living with you .  it just seems that if youre gonna have a roommate ,  yknow it might as well be the father .  
but joey ,  i dont think ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that .  i meanor he does .  
no i - i - i would love to be around for you and the baby .  and we - we can just try it like on a temporary basis .  
but ross ,  its you and me !  
so ?  sure !  but it - it wouldnt be anything romantic .  and im - im dating monadamnit mona !  i was supposed to meet her like an hour ago !  what is wrong with me ?  !  
all right now ,  so ?  what do you think ?  
i dont know .  is it crazy ?  
no !  no its not .  joey ,  this is a smart idea .

hey .  
hey .  
so rachels all moved out huh ?  how are you taking it ?  
well uh ,  i wanted to have a few beers ,  but uh ,  i got rid of those because rachel couldnt stand the smell of them .  but i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though .  and uh ,  its a couple weeks past its expiration date ,  so its got a bit of a kick .

i thought maybe you got me porn for valentines day .  
chandler ,  if you thought i was going to get you porn for valentines day  you were right !  apparently ,  its about a young girl who moves to the big city ,  you know ,  in search of stardom ,  but ends up having sex with a lot of guys !  yeah ,  it got four starts !   oh ,  wait a minute .  those arent stars .  anyway ,  you want to take a look ?

i missed you ,  too !  so ,  how was your week ?  
how exciting !  
oh no .  
 yeah right !  
joey cracks me up !  its like ,  yeah ,  why dont you have your ex - wife move in with you ?  that wouldnt be awkward at all !   
so ,  whatd you tell him ?  
how could you not tell mona that rachel is living with you ?  
i dont know ,  she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea !  um ,  plus ,  she ,  uh ,  she got me taffy !  
taffy ,  really ?  ive never had any .  
ever ?  !  
well ,  i think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats .   thank you !  so what ,  youre just never going to tell her ?  
oh ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  i will !  i just want to butter her up ,  first !  you know ,  im going to take her to an amazing valentines dinner .  do all this romantic stuff ,  and then ,  just when she thinks im the best boyfriend in the world ,  then im going to tell her that my pregnant ex - girlfriend is living with me .  
so ,  between her and me being friends ,  and her history with ross ,  it just isnt going to happen .  it would be like you falling in love with a cat .  
 hey !  
hey .  
hey ,  buddy .  hows my favorite dog ,  huh ?  hows my favorite dog ?   youre subdued .   did you give him a beer ?  
no .  
will you excuse us ,  we need to talk for a moment .  
yeah ,  sure .  go ahead .   oh ,  me ,  right !   
hes miserable !  what happened to him ?  
nothing .  we just talked about stuff .  
what stuff ?  
rachel stuff .  
oh joey ,  you bummed him out !  this was the happiest dog in the world ,  and he spends half a day with you ,  and look at him !  
hes breathing !  
okay ,  im going to take him back to wendys .  
well ,  im ,  uh ,  going to pick up mona .  what have you got going tonight ?  
oh ,  ive got big valentines plans !  ive got my chinese food on the way ,  and the rest of your saltwater taffy !  
yknow ,  its interesting !  most people think thats made with seawater ,  when in fact 
ross ,  we actually watched the documentary together .   
ooh !  my chinese food !  let me get my cash !   
change of plans ,  i made you a special valentines dinner !  surprise !  
ayyyayyyy !  
hi !  hi .  hi ,  rachel !   whats she doing here ?  
i have no idea !  
seriously ,  what is she doing ?  
why ?  
okay ,  but its valentines day !  
cant we just ask her to go ?  
no ,  no .  shes way to emotional .  and by emotional i mean crazy .   
oh ,  my god !  she has food delivered here ?  
mm - hmm .  shesshes emotional ,  but ,  but ballsy .  
you know what im going to do ?  im going to get in my sweats ,  and eat this in bed !   
you got another ex - wife back there ?  
 please start drinking !   
oh ,  rachel !  wait !  hey ,  i hope you dont take this the wrong way ,  but ,  but ,  um what are you doing ?  
no ,  no .  listen ,  ross is too nice to say anything ,  but this is his apartment ,  and ,  and ,  we gotta have some boundaries ,  so why dont you go back to your place and give us some privacy ?  
 but ,  but ,  mona ,  i live here .  
how long has it been this time ?  
90 seconds .  
thats better .  90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all i did was think about it .  
you know ,  it haunts me ?  up til now ,  the worst thing i ever saw ,  was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy .  after this ,  i would gladly make that my screensaver !  
okay ,  well ,  we have to get past this !  why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed ?  
i can do that .  
okay .   
okay .  now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair .   
oh ,  thank god !  
oh ,  i know !  
come in !  
 hi !  im so sorry to barge in on your valentines ,  but i had to get away from all the yelling .  mona is dumping ross .  
oh ,  my god .  
poor ross .   
oh ,  great .  we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear ,  but for this he closes the drapes !  
rach ,  you know that birthing tape you wanted to see ?  its here .  
oh ,  and we should warn you ,  before you watch it 
why ?  you saw it ?  is it scary ?  
well ,  lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself .  
well ,  now ,  wait .  now im all freaked out .  come on ,  you guys will watch it with me .  
no ,  but i will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you !  
cmon ,  seriously ,  you guys ,  youre not going to make me watch this alone !  
shes right of course not .  honey ,  get the tape .  
 this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape .   okay ,  here we go .  
okay .   ooh ,  my !   woah !  why is that baby torturing that woman ?  !  
why have i seen this thing three times ?  !  
its still beautiful .  
uh !  its horrible !  
i know !  i know ,  im so sorry for you !  
oh ,  my god !   
wait ,  you guys ,  look !  
what ?  did her ass explode ?  !  
no ,  the babys out !  look ,  look !  
oh ,  look at those little fingers and toes !  
and look how happy the mom is now !  
oh rach !  
hey ,  hey ,  man !  
hey ,  whats up ?  
uh mona just dumped me .  
oh ,  man ,  im sorry .  why ?  
well ,  with everything thats been going on lately ,  i havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend .  you know ,  i ,  uh ,  i didnt tell her i got rachel pregnant .  i gave her a key to my apartment ,  and then had the locks changed !  and then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me .  in a way ,  i actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner ,  you know ?  
still ,  that really sucks ,  man .  especially on valentines day .  
yeah .  wait a minute .  what are you doing here ?  joey tribbiani without a date on valentines day ?  whats going on ,  huh ?  girl trouble ?  
sort of .

well ,  um ,  actually ,  i - i took her to the planetarium .  thats - thats where we had our first date .  um ,  she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies ,  her favorite flower 
shhh !  i want to hear the rest !  
then ,  fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system ,  and the lights came down .  and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words  &quot; will you marry me ?  &quot;   
and the ring ,  was the size of my fist  !

you guys were right .  hes just too excited about everything .  i mean im all for living life ,  but this is the gellers 35th anniversary .  okay ?  lets call a spade a spade this party stinks .  
i know im having the worst time .  there was a 15 - minute line for the buffet ,  and when i finally got up to the plates ,  i slipped on a giant booger !  
are you sure it wasnt an oyster ?  
i guess it couldve been ,  i didnt really look at it .  yknow ,  i just wiped it on chandlers coat and got the hell out of there .  
hes just such a great guy im so excited about him .  
oh hey ,  you should be excited about him .  theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy .  
you think ?  
yeah .  ya know what i think; i think we were all just being too negative .  
youre right .  youre right ,  hes just embracing life .  we could all stand to be a little more like parker .  you know what ?  i am like him !  im a sunny ,  positive person .  
actually ,  you have a little bit of an edge .  
whats that now ?  
nothing 
look !  its the bunny hop !  
you do ?  !  
are you kidding ?  people acting like animals to music .  come on !   
okay its time for the toast !  umm now - now ,  i know that ross usually gives the toast ,  but this year im going to do it .   
ross ,  why dont you give us your toast now ?  
youre not going to say anything ?  on our 35th wedding anniversary 
my god what a fantastically well lit hallway !  
i must say this apartment ,  its ,  its ,  there are no words 
its a haven .  a third - floor paradise .  a modern - day eden in the midst 
that sounds great .   my god this is the most comfortable couch ive ever sat on in my entire life .

or jenga .  
i lose ,  now jenga .  
is something wrong ?  
well ,  excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam !  
im sorry thats who i am .  im a positive person .  
so what do you want me to do ,  you want me to be more negative ,  less happy ?  
fine !  well then to quote ross ,   &quot; id better be going .  &quot;  
isnt this the most incredible fight youve ever had in your entire life ?  
and then ,  we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar !  
ross ,  it just wouldnt have been feasible .  
but having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem ?  
it was really fun being married to you tonight .  
yeah !  and !  and ,  it was the easiest 400 bucks ive ever made .  
okay ross ,  can i uh ,  can i ask you something ?  
yeah .  
that proposal ,  at the planetarium 
i know ,  i know it was stupid .  
are you kidding ?  !  with the ,  with the lilies ,  and - and the song ,  and the stars !  it was really wonderful !  did you just make that up ?  
no ,  actually i thought about it when ,  when we were going out .  its how i imagined i uh ,  i would ask you to marry me .  
well ,  that wouldve been very hard to say no too .  
its a good thing i didnt do it ,  because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding .   okay ,  good night 
goodnight  
even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up ?  
i will think about it .  
okay thats it .  i give up .  at mom and dads 40th anniversary ,  youre the one giving the speech .

fine !  fine !  yknow what ?  whatever you want .  okay ?  youre the mommy .

  &quot; i thought i knew who the enemy was ,  but it was you all along .  &quot;  
ross .  
yeah ?  
can i ask you something ?  
uh - huh .  
when carol was pregnant with ben 
mmm ?  
were you this irritating ?  
wow !  
excuse me ?  !  
oh nothing .  nothing !  just uh ,  youve been a little short with me lately .  im not trying to irritate you .  
well then you just must have a natural talent for it .  
yknow what ?  the doctor will be in soon ,  why dont we not speak until then .  
 okay .   seriously ,  breathe louder ross !  thats great !  
yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil !   
hi dr .  long ,  how are you ?  
 oh ,  youre nice to her .  
she has the drugs !  
okay .   
yeah .  
eh ,  just a tad .  still could last a little while longer .  if youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along .  
do them !  !  in my experience ive found that some of them are quite effective .  
well ,  we are ready to try anything .  
okay .  
great !  we will do all of those .  taking a long walk ,  and then theres the one thats  
good job joe !  well done !  top notch !  
you liked it ?  you really liked it ?

i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic .  
you fell asleep !  !  there was no kangaroo !  they didnt take any of my suggestions !  thats for coming buddy .  ill see you later .   
hey !  
hey .  
hi !  
what did the doctor say ?  any news on when the baby will come ?  
no .  but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor .  
yeah ,  we tried them all .  we went for a walk ,  uh we tried a special tea ,  caster oil ,  spicy food nothing has worked .  
well ,  there is one thing that we havent tried ,  but someone thinks that ,    &quot; that will open up a can of worms .  &quot;  
well what is it ?  what is it ?  if its gonna help bring the baby here ,  like today .  i mean ,  i think you should do it .  
its sex .  
do it !  
monica !  
im just saying its been a really long time for you .  i mean ,  women have needs .  do it ,  get yours !  
oh i - i dont know about that .  no ,  i think that if the two of you had sex the - the - the repercussions would be catastrophic .  
all right ,  lets be practical ,  if ross isnt willing to do it ,  hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with .  you can borrow chandlerchandler is good !  
monica ,  what is the matter with you ?  
nothing .  i just want the baby to be born today .  
why ?  why today ?  
okay fine !  i keep betting phoebe that youre gonna have the baby and i dont want to lose again !  
what ?  !  while shes been going through this hell ,  youve been making money ?  !  youre betting on your friend staying in this misery ?  !   
ill take that bet .  
what ?  !

because it kinda looked like i did .  
again ,  what ?  !  
okay well ,  i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand 
as we all are at some point during the day .  
it wasnt my ring !  it fell out of rosss jacket !  and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing !  
ross had a ring ?  !  and he was gonna propose ?  
i guess .  
and you did it first ?  !  this is gonna kill him !  you know how much he loves to propose !  
i know !  i know its awful .  
well ,  what did she say ?  
 she said yes .  
does ross know ?  
oh god ,  what the hell am i going to tell him ?  
well maybe you dont have to tell him anything .  
oh ,  i like that .  yeah 
if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out ,  but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass !  
 now lets not get carried away .   
i want a baby .  
honey ,  weve been over this .  i need to be facing the other way .  
come on !  come on ,  if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant .  do you think that closets still available ?  
im so tired .   yeah okay ,  but no foreplay .

uhh i think i just got engaged .  
oh my god !  he did it ?  
welldid you know he was gonna ask me ?

and you really think this is a good idea ?  
i just talked him into it ,  dont tell me i have to do you too .  the puppet master gets tired people .  
i just dont know !  it just doesnt feel right .

 are you kidding me ?  !  
its just so frustrating !  why doesnt she want my breast ?  !  
oh hey !  wait up !  
hi !  
congratulations !  i didnt want to say anything in front of joey cause i didnt know if he knew yet .  
what ,  that we had a baby ?  come on lets give him a little credit ,  although ,  he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier .  
no !  no ,  that you and rachel are engaged !  
what ?  
oh ,  its a secret .  oh goodie !  yes !  we havent done the secret thing in a long time .  
phoebe ,  there is no secret .  okay ?  i didnt propose .  
are you lying ?  is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor ?  
 i am a doctor !  yknow what ?  im just gonna go and talk to rachel myself .  
all right ,  me too .   should we wake her up ?  
no !  no ,  come on let her sleep !  shes so exhausted .  
and so engaged .   
what ?   oh my god !  she - she thinks were engaged !  why ?  why ?  why would she think were engaged ?  !  
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring ?  yknow ross doctors are supposed to be smart .  
i didnt give her that ring !  
really ?  
no !  
so whose ring is it ?  
its mine .  
is it an engagement ring ?  
yes !  
but you didnt give it to her ?  
no !  
but you were going to propose ?  
no !  !  
huh ,  i might be losing interest in this .  
look .  look ,  my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel ,  but all i wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again .  
oh ,  what beautiful lukewarm sentiment .  
look ,  i didnt want to rush into anything .  and it seemed like she didnt want to either .  but i dont ,  i dont understand how any of this happened !  what ?  did she find the ring in my jacket ,  assume that i was going to propose ,  throw it on ,  and - and just start telling people ?  
no !  no ,  she said you actually proposed to her .  
look ,  we cant stay in here forever .  
oh ,  i still cant believe my dad saw us having sex !  he didnt make it to one of piano recitals ,  but this he sees !  
this is okay .  were all adults here; theres nothing to be ashamed of .  now ,  lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door .   
of course .  ill always be your dad .  
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there ,  that wasnt for fun .  
it wasnt fun ?  !  
oh ,  i dont think that .  before today i never thought of you two having sex at all .  it was a simpler time .  
what ?  
oh my god !  this is so exciting !  well ,  get back in there !   ill guard the door !  
whoa - whoa - whoa !  i dont think so !  arent you ovulating ?  
well you gotta get at it princess !  when your mother and i were trying to conceive you ,  whenever she was ovulating ,  bam ,  we did it .  thats how i got my bad hip .  
this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother ,  she was 
youre right ,  youre right .  this is about your positions .  now ,  what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child ,  although it might feel good .  
but pleasure is important ,   and it helps if the woman has an orgasm .  you up to the task sailor ?

rach ,  i told you ,  you can &apos;t call him every time any little thing comes up .  
yeah well ,  not anymore i can &apos;t .  he fired us !  what are we gonna do ?  we have to find a pediatrician .  wait wait ,  monica said that when you guys were growing up ,  you really liked your doctor .  what was his name ?  
dr .  gettleman ?  yeah i know ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .  in fact ,  i think he &apos;s dead .  
argh !  why does everything happen to me ?  !  
rach ,  i promise first thing tomorrow we &apos;ll find another doctor ,  but i gotta get up early and i &apos;m not feeling all that well .  
what ?  what ,  do you mean you &apos;re not feeling well ?  what do you have ?  is it rubella ?  because don &apos;t go near emma ,  she has not had that shot .  
you know ?  come to think of it ,  it does feel rubella - like !   
 wiener ,  wiener  wiener ,  wiener !  !  !  
 rachel !  !  !  
 hey !  
hey !  
so how is this for our big double date tonight ?   
 oh my god !  
ooh ,  great !  just the reaction i was hoping for .  
yeah ,  so you found someone for me .  you didn &apos;t forget ?  
of course not !  and you &apos;re gonna love mary ellen .  she &apos;s really smart and cute and funny ,  and i can &apos;t tell you how i know this ,  but she &apos; not opposed to threesomes .  so tell me some about my guy .  
no .  
come on ,  give me something .  what &apos;s his name ?  
mike .  
mike ?  okay !  what &apos;s his last name ?  
damnit !  is there no mystery left in romance anymore !  ?  
all right ,  we &apos;ll se you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours .  
it &apos;s impossible to find a good doctor .  i mean ,  how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee ?  
excuse me ?  
i know what she &apos;s talking about .  
we &apos;ve got to find a new pediatrician .  ross was getting sick last night ,  and i think emma may have caught it .  
why don &apos;t you go see dr .  gettleman ?  
ross said he died .  
he didn &apos;t die .  i saw his daughter last week .  said he was fine .  her on the other hand ,  botched botox .  
oh ,  great !  well ,  then i &apos;m gonna take emma to see him .  i wonder why ross said that he died .  
oh ,  maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist .  
he saw a therapist ?  
yeah ,  he used to have this recurring nightmare ,  just really freaked him out .  
why ?  what was it ?  
that i was going to eat him .  
 
yeah ?  
i gotta tell you ,  i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m doing this with you .  although i did just get out of a nine - year relationship ,  so i guess i should be open and taking some risks .  
i am mike .  
atta boy !   
okay ,  look .  .  .  
how do i and joey know each other ?  wow ,  if i had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that .  
yeah ,  we met in college .   i mean ,  high school .  
well ,  i &apos;m a lawyer .  
actually ,  i just gave up my practice .  
i always wanted to play piano professionally ,  and i figured if i don &apos;t do this now ,  i never will .  
wow ,  that &apos;s great !  i liked that better than the law thing ,  so .  .  .  
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike .  
no ,  no ,  that &apos;s not what i meant .  let &apos;s get you a cocktail .  
 
hey !  
hey !  
what are you doing ?  
looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa .  
that &apos;s so sweet .  find anything ?  
slim pickings .  
nothing ,  huh ?  
no ,   &apos;slim pickings &apos; ,  it &apos;s a barbecue restaurant .  they &apos;re looking for a cook .  actually  &apos;cook &apos; may be a bit of a stretch .  they &apos;re looking for someone to shovel mesquite .  
 &apos;slim pickings &apos; .  .  . that is so cheesy .  
 &apos;so cheesy &apos; also has an opening .  
honey ,  that &apos;s okay .  i actually know this woman ,  nancy ,  who &apos;s a restaurant biz head - hunter .  maybe she &apos;ll know of something .  
can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me .  when we get to tulsa i &apos;m taking you for a great dinner at  &apos;slim pickings &apos; .   &apos;so cheesy &apos; ?   &apos;whole hog &apos; ?  it &apos;s going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa .  
dr .  gettleman is finishing up with a patient ,  he should be out shortly .  not strep .  
thanks doctor .  
you know ,  it &apos;s so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long and i &apos;ve never heard about you .  
no ,  i didn &apos;t .  
that &apos;s okay mike ,  i have forgiven you .  and now we &apos;re friends again everything &apos;s great !  mary ellen wait ,  is your mom okay ?  
 &apos;days of our lives &apos; !  that &apos;s why you look so familiar !  
what ?  !  
what ?  !  
do you not know each other ?  
 of course we do !  mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school .  yeah ,  where we pretend we don &apos;t know each other .  we played all kinds of games .   hey ,  remember the one where i punch you in the face for not being cool ?  !  
 six !  
what are you doing ?  i said seven !   argh !  !  !  
joey ,  why did you set me up with a stranger ?  
i &apos;m sorry too .  and just to be clear ,  i didn &apos;t hit his mother with a car .  
 you are unbelievable !  i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you ,  you know .  mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose .  
who are you kidding ?   you just find some guy off the street for me ?  oh god !  this is humiliating !  
look phoebe i &apos;m so sorry !  hey ,  look ,  if you don &apos;t like this guy i can find you a better one .   mike !  !  mike !  !  
it was nice meeting you !  
 you &apos;re leaving too ?  
honey ,  we &apos;re leaving tomorrow you &apos;ve still got a lot of packing to do .  
you &apos;re right .   maybe i shouldn &apos;t go .  
what ?  
so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant ,  javo  .  it &apos;s just a little outside of tulsa .  
how far outside ?  
manhattan .  
and you &apos;re thinking of taking it ?   so before you said being me with me was more important than any job ,  but i guess now it &apos;s old job ,   me ,   new job .  
i &apos;m gonna miss this hand !  okay i know it &apos;s a lot to ask ,  but oh my god chandler ,  this is a once in a lifetime opportunity .  
what happened to  &apos;you can &apos;t live without me four days a week &apos; ?  
well ,  if you really think about it ,  i mean four days is not that long .  i mean ,  i see you monday before you go to work ,  and i see you thursday when you get back ,  and i always work late on tuesdays ,  so really if you think about it ,  it &apos;s really just one day .  and well ,  if we can &apos;t make it one day ,  we &apos;ve got real problems my friend .  
i think you should take the job .  
really ?  
yeah .  i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey .  
that &apos;s the nicest anyone has ever said to me !   
hey !  
how was the pediatrician ?  
oh ,  i really liked him .   yeah ,  it was really ,  really ,  really good .  
you promised you wouldn &apos;t say anything .  
i know .   ross still sees his pediatrician !  !  !   i don &apos;t care !  
are you serious ?  you still see dr .  gettleman ?  
he &apos;s a brilliant diagnostician !  
diagnostician or boo - boo fixer ?  
ross ,  seriously !  you &apos;ve gotta go to an appropriate doctor .  
why ?  why ?  i know it &apos;s a little weird ,  but hey ,  he &apos;s a great doctor ,  okay ?  he knows my medical history ,  and every time i go in there ,  he makes a big deal .   &apos;ah look ,  it &apos;s my favorite patient !  &apos; 
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy ?  
hey ,  i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college !  
that was not a security blanket !  that was a wall - hanging !  
excuse me ,  hi .  i was hoping i would run into you .  can we talk ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  really ,  i &apos;m so embarrassed .  really ,  i &apos;m a pretty nice guy .  just ask my parole officer .  .  . apparently i &apos;m not a funny guy .  
because i was told i &apos;d get a free dinner ,  which i didn &apos;t .  and that i &apos;d meet a pretty girl .  which i did .  
my name in mike ,  and i do play piano .  
there isn &apos;t a piano here .  
that wouldn &apos;t stand in the way of a true pianist .  
really ?  
that &apos;s great .  what kind of music do you play ?  
do you think that maybe ,  sometime ,  i could .  .  .  
okay .  do you think maybe sometime i could take you out ?  
 
 oh ,  you just caught me off guard !  yeah ,  that would be nice .  
 mommy ,  i can &apos;t find waldo .  
wow ,  so your child is a big fan of the waldo books too ?

yeah i didn &apos;t disguise that very well did i .  
 hey 
 hi 
listen to this .  .  .  i went out with this girl last night and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her .   
so basically you &apos;ve slept with all the woman in new york and now you &apos;re just going around again .  
well that &apos;s not even the weird part .  i don &apos;t think she remembered sleeping with me .  
but you don &apos;t remember sleeping with her .  
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable ,  you guys know .  
what ,  how do we know ,  we never slept with you .  
and who &apos;s fault is that .  
what &apos;s the big deal ,  you forgot ,  she forgot ,  maybe you were having an off night 
hey !  i never have an off night ok although sometimes when i &apos;m a little bloated i don &apos;t feel very sexy but even then i &apos;m better then most !  
honey why don &apos;t you just let it go and ask her out again .  
yeah your both so slutty you don &apos;t even remember who you &apos;ve slept with ,  you &apos;re made for each other .  
interesting .  all right i &apos;ll go out with her again and try to get past it  oh salt bloaty !  
joey ,  joey .

it &apos;s open .  
hey !  
hey !  mike called were going out again !  yay !  yay !   
yay !   quick thing ,  i went to talk to mike .  
what ?  wha - wha - wha - did you do ross !  
oh boy you got mad at that part .  i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah ,  blah ,  blah ,  and i ended up telling him that .  
what !  
umm .  that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum .  
what !  why ?  
well he seemed to bum hard that you &apos;d never been in a serious relationship .  
 if you hadn &apos;t just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now !  
well phoebe ,  i think you &apos;ll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum ,  his a kite designer  and he used to date oprah .   
i &apos;m not going along with some lie you made ross ,  no i &apos;m just gonna be honest with him .  
good yeah just be honest with him .  
yeah i &apos;ve nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven &apos;t been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month .  ok i haven &apos;t had a real boyfriend you know if he can &apos;t handle that he can leave .  which he will and that &apos;s ok .  so i &apos;ll just be alone forever you know alright i &apos;ll be .  it &apos;ll be fine .  it &apos;ll be fine .  i &apos;ll go walking tours with widows and lesbians .  oh  
i &apos;ll get it 
 you know i &apos;m trying to think of the last time i opened a door and you weren &apos;t there ,  phoebe are you ok ?   
so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents ,  a perfect couple getting divorced ,  i kinda took it the hardest cause i was the youngest .  
what ?  
what !  when ?  
i really ,  really think i would remember sleeping with you 
no it &apos;s not ringing any bells .  
my god woman !  how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this ?  
but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross 
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer .  
i just think there &apos;s somebody better out there for you ,   i mean i &apos;m not saying me but .  maybe me .  
and you don &apos;t have to worry about glue sniffing with me .  although i do smell the occasional magic marker ,  yeah ah anyway i just think i can make you happy .  
what &apos;s wrong ?  
uh huh 
no .  well look can i think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you .  
definitely 
hi honey i &apos;m home !

oh it was great .  
here why don &apos;t you sit down ,  get yourself comfortable because i .   have a little surprise for you .  
well ,  well ,  well it must be five in tulsa because it &apos;s six o clock in nyc !  
ok  this is how much i love you .   
 honey why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around .  
is this not the good part ?  do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier .  
no i &apos;m not quite sure you got the right movie that &apos;s all .  
oh well this is the only one they had at our video store ,  but they did have something called crocodile killers .  or does it always have to be sharks ?  
does what always have to be sharks .  
honey look we can do something else ,  do you want me to get into the tub and thrash .  
what &apos;s going on ?  
sweetie it &apos;s ok ,  i still love you ,  let me be a part of this .  
let me be a part of this !  
i saw what you were doing in tulsa .  angry sharks turn you on !  
no they don &apos;t 
then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat .  
oh my god !  when you came in i switched the channel ,  i was just watching regular porn 
really ?  
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american action .  
i cannot tell you how happy that makes me !   
you are an amazing wife .   no really you &apos;re amazing you were actually gonna do this for me ,  i mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that .  
 see ordinarily i would talk to her ,  but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her ?  did i not sleep with her ?  
you know maybe this is a wake up call ,  about your whole dating attitude .  your in your thirty &apos;s and you &apos;ve never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship ,  here you go from woman to woman ,  meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn &apos;t tern into anything serious .

 what ,  the blonde with no bra ?  
she was blonde ?   just a sec .  !  okay ,  okay .  this one &apos;s name is sandy .  she &apos;s got a degree in early childhood education ,  uhm .  .  .  she worked for her last family for three years .  
 hi .  .  .  i &apos;m sandy .  
hi !  i - i - is this a bad time ?  
well ,  just for a couple of days ,  uhm .  .  .  i &apos;m here to explain to the people who gave us our grant ,  why it &apos;s a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm .  .  .  accomplished uhm .  .  .  nothing .  
well ,  it got me to new york anyway ,  and then i got on a cab at the airport ,  and the guy said where to ?  and i just .  .  .  gave him your address i .  .  .  i .  .  .  i didn &apos;t even think about it .  
damn it !  
schto ya ztez vigul .  .  .  ui !  roughly translated that means uhm .  .  .  this thing 
come on ,  don &apos;t be crazy .  nobody is that beautiful ,  but .  .  .  well ,  you are .   well ,  so ,  uhm .  .  .  are you seeing .  .  .  anyone ?   
i &apos;m .  .  .  i &apos;m just .  .  .  i &apos;m the worst person ever .  how can i not tell david that i &apos;m seeing mike ?  
maybe he didn &apos;t give you a chance .  
he said 
oh ,  well .  .  .  that had been your window .  
yeah !  i mean ,  i don &apos;t know .  i was just  ,  i was looking ,  i was looking just ,  he &apos;s so irresistible .  
really ?  the scientist guy ?  
really ?  chandler ?  
continue .  .  .  
oh . okay ,  then it gets worse ,   &apos;cause then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night .  
phoebe !  
i know !   evil !  and .  .  .  and .  .  .  and .  .  .  i like mike so much ,  you know .  it &apos;s just going really well .  oh my god !  
wow ,  isn &apos;t it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys ?  
 uhuh .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  !  ,  you know .  and given my life long search for irony ,  you can imagine how happy i am .  
what are you gonna do ?  
i mean i guess ,  i just have to .  .  .  tell david that nothing can happen between us .  unless i don &apos;t .  .  .  you know ,  complicated moral situation ,  no right ,  no wrong .  .  .  
you have to tell david !  
 funniest guy she &apos;s ever met !   i &apos;m funny ,  right .  .  .  ?  what do you know ,  you &apos;re a door .  .  .  you just like knock - knock jokes .  .  .   save it for inside !   
heeeeeey !  
hey !  
hey !  
so .  .  .  oklahoma is a crazy place .  you know ,  they call it the sooner state .  frankly i &apos;d sooner be in any other state .   and what &apos;s with oklahoma having a pan handle ?  can all states have stuff like that ?  hey yeah ,  i &apos;m from the waistband ,  wyoming .  but when i was seven ,  we headed over to the crotch .  
 was your cabin pressurised ?  
 and don &apos;t get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk .  
okay .   
what &apos;s with the word y &apos;all ?  you know ,  just .  .  .  two words just .  .  .  pushed together .  .  .  are we all allowed to do that ,  because if so ,  i say why stop there ?  you know ,  your new poodle could be your noodle .  and fried chicken ?  could be fricken . waiter ,  waiter excuse me ,  i &apos;ll have the fricken ?   see ,  that &apos;s .  .  .  that &apos;s funny with the fricken ,  right ?  
no ,  it just remind me of something this guy did today at work .  i told you about that funny guy ,  geoffrey ,  right ?  
yeah ,  he came up .  .  .  
well ,  he did this bit .  .  .  you probably had to be there ,  but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer ,  eating a raw chicken .   
 were you there ?  
i really do understand how hard it &apos;s gotta be to leave your child with another person .  i mean ,  it &apos;s leaving behind a piece of your heart .  .  .   
sandy ,  that &apos;s exactly what it is .  .  .  
are you gay ?   
it &apos;s okay .  i get that a lot doing what i do .  but i am straight .  i - i &apos;m engaged actually .  
her name is deliah .  
oh ,  that &apos;s pretty .  
i realise how it &apos;s .  .  .  a bit unorthodox for some people ,  but i really believe ,  the most satisfying thing you can do with your life ,  is take care of a child .  
like in my last job ,  i met daniel when he was three weeks old .  and i was his name for me .  .  .  i &apos;ll see you every day .  .  .  right in .  .  .   
yeah ,  kids say all kinds of crap .   
oh ,  oh ,  i can do it for her ,  if you want .  .  .  
oh ,  that would be great !   i love him ,  i love him ,  i love him .  .  .  
oh ,  come on ,  rach ,  he &apos;s a guy !  
so wh .  .  ?  he &apos;s smart ,  he &apos;s qualified .  give me one good reason we shouldn &apos;t try him out .  
because ,  it &apos;s weird !  
why ?  
what kind of job is that for a man ?  a nanny ?  i - it &apos;s like if a woman wanted to be .  .  .  
 yes ?  
i er .  .  .  i hope you don &apos;t mind .  i used some of my home - made lotion on emma .  it &apos;s a mixture of calendula and honey cream .  it &apos;ll dry that rash right up .  plus .  .  .  it keeps the hands young .  .  .   
that &apos;s great !   i &apos;m sorry .  it &apos;s just .  .  .  such an emotional thing when you &apos;re welcomed into a new family .  .  .  
oooh .  .  .  ***i really can &apos;t hear what she says*** come here .  
hey !   i need you to set me up for a joke .  later ,  when monica is around ,  i need you to ask me about fire trucks .

 well ,  thank god your livelihood doesn &apos;t depend on it .

what do you do with your money now ?  
well ,  i just tape it to the back of my toilet tank .   i didn &apos;t say that !  it &apos;s in a bank guarded by robots !  
do you have any ideas ?  
uh ,  yeah .  .  .  this guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm .  that &apos;d be kinda cool huh ?  pitchin &apos; in on the weekends ,  helping to plant the emus .  .  .  
joe .  .  .  emus are birds .  you raise them for meat .  
 yeah !  right !   people eat birds .  .  .  bird meat .  .  .  now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to .  .  .  you go to a  or .  .  .  or maybe just a wing or .  .  .   
joey ,  i think you should consider something a little less risky .  i mean ,  i think in this market ,  real estate is your best investment . the fed .  just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible .   that &apos;s right ,  i know some stuff !  
real estate ,  huh ?  hmmm .  .  .

hey dude ,  what &apos;s up ?  
don &apos;t judge me ,  i &apos;m only human !  
did you take that tape ?  
i had to !  okay ,  imagine you were married .  .  .  and you found a tape of your wife in another guys &apos; apartment .  .  .  wouldn &apos;t you need to know what was on it ?

yeah .  .  .  !  ?  
how did she get me to settle down ?  
allright ,  i &apos;m gonna watch it .  .  .  i mean look ,  it &apos;s probably not even what i think it is .  .  .  and even if it is .  .  .  it can &apos;t possibly be as bad as what i &apos;m picturing in my head .  .  .   can it ?  
guess i don &apos;t know .  my experience taped .  .  .  she doesn &apos;t say no to much else ,  i tell ya .  .  .  
then you &apos;re gonna have to watch it for me .  
 what ?  whoo .  .  .  what ?  
just for a few seconds ,  so i can know what it is .  .  .  please ?  
all right ,  fine .  .  .  but if i enjoy this ,  you have only yourself to blame .  .  .   
why am i hearing cheering ?  
well it &apos;s okay ,  its like .  .  .  its just a football game .  
football ?  just football ?  
yeah ,  see .  .  .  you were all worried for nothing .  
it &apos;s football .  .  .  it &apos;s just football .  .  .  this is great !  this is the first time i &apos;ve ever enjoyed football .  .  .  it may be customary to get a beer .  .  .   what the .  .  .   what are you doing ?  
you don &apos;t wanna see what i just saw !   
okay .  .  .  aahhh .  .  .  please laugh for mommy .  .  .  please ?  please laugh for mommy .  .  .   not funny huh ?  oh so ,  is it .  .  .  only offensive novelty rap ?  or maybe just ,  you know ,  rap in general ?   &apos;cause mommy can rap .  .  .   my name is mommy and i &apos;m here to say  /  that all the babies are .  .  .  oh ,  i can &apos;t rap .  .  .  allright sweetheart .  .  .  this is only because i love you so much ,  and i know that you &apos;re not gonna tell anybody .  .  .   i like .  .  .  big butts and i cannot lie .  .  .   /  you other brothers can &apos;t deny .  .  .   /  when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face .  .  .   yes !  yes !  yes !  yes !  oohhhhh !  oh !   i like big butts and i cannot lie .  .  .   /  you other brothers can &apos;t deny .  .  .  oh emma you &apos;re laughing !  oh you are ,  you really do like big butts ,  don &apos;t you .  oh you beautiful little weirdo .  .  .   
hey !  
oh you missed it .  she was laughing .  oh it was amazing .  it was amazing .  it was the most beautiful ,  beautiful sound that .  .  .  
oh i know ,  isn &apos;t it ?  ooh .  .  .  what &apos;d you do to get her to laugh ?  
oh !  you know ,  i just .  .  .  couple of things i tried  .  .  .  i just sang a little doo .  .  .  itsy bitsy spider .  .  .  
you sang baby got back didn &apos;t you ?  
phoebe writes lots of great songs .  wha .  .  .  what was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved ?  
 no .  .  .  
stop !   
oh !  
phoebe you don &apos;t have to eat .  .  .  
so you stole that tape from richard &apos;s apartment ?  
whoho ho .  .  .  listen to the judgement from the porn star !  
that tape was never meant to be seen by .  .  .   joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private .  
 monica ,  look .  .  .  i don &apos;t think you and i have any secrets anymore .  .  .   not ready to joke about it yet ,  okay ,  i see you later .   
why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it ?  
because that &apos;s who i am ,  okay ?  i &apos;m sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn &apos;t bother him .  just &apos;d be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men &apos;s club over brandy and moustaches .  
is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache ?  
this is about you and richard .  he &apos;s clearly not over you .  he keeps a tape so he can .  .  .  look at it whenever he wants .  
isn &apos;t that sad ?  i mean ,  can you see how pathetic that is ?  you shouldn &apos;t be jealous .  you should feel bad for him .  
oh ,  yeah ,  well ,  poor richard .  y &apos; .  .  .  i can grow a moustache !  
chandler ,  this is not our problem .  we &apos;ve got each other .  that &apos;s all that matters .  
yeah ,  oh ,  but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air .  .  .  
cowboy boots ?  i &apos;ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole life !   
oh ,  good ,  good .  play more ,   &apos;cause i wanna see how it ends .  
that &apos;s not me !  
what .  .  .  ?  that &apos;s not you !  life is good again !  ride  &apos;em cowgirl !  
that bastard taped over me !   
is that a problem ?  
the woman you what ?   
the woman i love .  .  .   i love you .  .  .  which is probably something i shouldn &apos;t say for the first time in front of my parents .  .  .  and tom and sue .  .  . who are by the way the most sinfully boring i &apos;ve ever met in my life .  .  .  
you do ?  
wanna get out of here ?  
mom ,  dad ,  thanks for dinner .  
she sweat ,  wet .  got it going like a turbo  &apos;vette .

rachel please !  that is so inappropriate !   
hey hon ?  would you help me get the plates down ?  
yeah .  hey !  here &apos;s an idea .  why don &apos;t we use our wedding china today ?  
no ,  i think we should save our china for something really special .  .  . like ,  if the queen of england comes over .  
honey ,  she keeps cancelling on us .  .  . take the hint !  
what if something gets broken ?  they &apos;re so expensive !  
what is the point of having them ,  if we never use them ?  
ok .  . but if something gets broken ,  and then the queen comes over .  .  .  
i will explain it to her .  
oh yeah !  like i &apos;m going to let you talk to the queen .  
wow the parade is really good this year / man those horses can crap !   
muskogee ?  that &apos;s like four hours from tulsa !  woo hoo !  soap ,  days of our lives .   
oh my god !  !

yeah !  !  i forgot i &apos;m supposed to be there !  i can &apos;t believe i forgot !  i usually write stuff like this down on my arm !   
oh !  stupid long sleeves !  
what are you going to do ?  
 i guess i &apos;m going to come up with a really good reason why i wasn &apos;t there !  the producer is going to be so mad at me .  .  . he sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there six am sharp ,  that means you tribbiani !   like i was some kind of idiot !  
well ,  you proved them wrong .  
yeah .  .  .

ewwww !   
god !  she is .  .  . unbelievable !  
i know !  i mean a phd is just as good as an md .  
stupid thanksgiving !  
my boyfriend cancelled on me .  i mean i ,  i finally find a real relationship someone that i can spend this day with ,  and then his wife comes back into town .  i swear ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s ,  not even worth dating married guys .  
i was so looking forward to this .  it was going to be such a beautiful thanksgiving .  we were going to have sushi .  .  .  
oh amy .  .  . don &apos;t cry .  erm .  ross ?  could i talk to you in private ?  
sure you wanna go upstairs ?  or .  .  .   
erm look .  i was thinking ,  if it &apos;s ok with monica ,  i would like to invite amy ,  to thanksgiving .  
you know i think that &apos;s a great idea .  it &apos;ll be like the pilgrims being in the indian &apos;s syphillis .  
look ,  i know she &apos;s a little tough to take .  .  . but she has no where else to go .  and she &apos;s my sister .  alright ?  and she &apos;s emma &apos;s aunt ?  and i &apos;d like them to bond .  .  .  
ok .  .  . fine .  but i don &apos;t want them bonding too much .  i don &apos;t want her telling emma she needs a nose job .  
well !  ross ,  you know what ?  she may need one we &apos;re just going to have to make our peace with that .   
hi !  !  
oh my god !  you &apos;re on days of our lives !  
wow !  they must put alot of make - up on you .  away as chandler pats his back . ] 
ooo !  that &apos;s a funny noise !   
phoebs !  i still need some help here .  
oh !  right ok .  erm .  .  . ok .  . so it &apos;s not just the lie you tell ,  but it &apos;s the way you tell it for example ,  if you look down on the ground when you &apos;re talking ,  people know you &apos;re lying .  
oh .  .  . i don &apos;t know why this is so hard for me .  .  . y &apos;know what i mean ?  lying is basically just acting ,  and i am a terrific actor !  
hey !  where &apos;s the baby ?  
listen ,  i was just thinking .  you know what would be incredible ?  if you guys died !  
now listen ,  not that you guys could stop me or anything ,  cos you know ,  you &apos;d be dead .  but ,  i was thinking about changing her name .  .  . i &apos;m just not really a big fan of emily .  
emma .  
phoe - be !   
well ,  who would ?  
well ,  we haven &apos;t officially asked them yet ,  but ,  we would want monica and chandler .  
i can &apos;t believe you want us to raise emma !  
i don &apos;t believe this .  hold on a second .  you guys die .  .  . and i don &apos;t get your baby ?  ?  ?  
connected ?  i mean .  .  . to what ?  she &apos;s a lump !  
this guy ?  seriously ?    
ok .  .  . it &apos;s time for dinner !  erm .  .  . everyone ,  we &apos;re using our fancy china ,  and erm ,  it &apos;s very expensive .  .  . so pleaaase be careful .   
whoa .  .  .  .  . whoa .  .  .  .  .  .  whoa !  
ok er .  .  . just to be clear ,  comedy with the plates ,  will not be well - received .    
hey !  !  how come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses ?  do you not trust me with the fancy plate ?  
y &apos;know ,  this is such a slap in the face .  i mean ,  i &apos;m your sister ,  and you &apos;d give your baby to these .  .  .  . strangers over me .  
no .  .  .  . ross &apos; sister was really fat .  
er .  .  . no .  she was this really dorky girl in high school ,  who used to follow rachel around like a puppy .  .  .  
amy !  !  you &apos;ve got to stop doing that .   
ok ,  how bout this .  if you guys die ,  and the crazy plate lady dies .  .  . then do i get the baby .  
no .  .  . if crazy plate lady .  .  .  if monica dies .  .  . then .  .  . i would get emma .  .  . right ?  
well ,  actually .  .  .  .  
actually what ?  
er .  .  . it &apos;s just that in that case .  .  . then erm .  .  . emma would go to my parents .  
hurts doesn &apos;t it ?   
er .  .  .  who has to die for me to get her ?   
so ,  if monica &apos;s not around ,  i &apos;m not good enough to raise emma ?  
no ,  that &apos;s not what we are saying .  .  .  
yeah !  he &apos;s lying he looked down !   
what .  .  . what is wrong with me ?  am i ,  am i incompetent ?  because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !  
honey ,  you &apos;re taking this the wrong way .  we think you &apos;re going to be a wonderful parent !  it &apos;s just that ,  you &apos;re more the .  .  . y &apos;know ,  fun parent .  
yeah !  and we wanna make sure that emma also has someone like monica ,  who &apos;s more of a disciplinarian .  .  . someone who can be firm ,  and strict .  
that &apos;s not how you see me is it ?  
no ,  you &apos;re all about the fun .   
look ,  i may not know alot about babies ,  but you really think i &apos;m not capable ?  
no .  .  . you both are equally capable .  it &apos;s just that you &apos;re strongest ,  when you &apos;re together .  
ok ,  so if we both had emma ,  and i die  she &apos;d have to give her up .  
sure !  monica would have to give her up .  
i lie better than that right ?   
hey .  .  . there you are .  you disappeared after dinner .  
oh ,  did somebody miss me ?  is there a child to raise poorly ?  
ross and rachel don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about !  i mean it &apos;s not like they &apos;re so responsible .  emma as a product of a bottle of murlo and a five - year - old condom .  
y &apos;know but they &apos;re right .  i &apos;m not a strong father - figure and i never will be .  
no .  .  .  . you learn these things .  you grow into it .  
yeah ,  but it &apos;s not who i am .  everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid .  and it &apos;s true !  and ,  look ,  everybody knows it .  
i don &apos;t know it !  i want to have a kid with you because i think you &apos;re going to be an amazing dad .  at the fun parts and at the hard parts .  
oh yeah ,  well ,  can you picture me saying ,   &quot; go to your room !  you &apos;re grounded !  &quot;  
can you hear me say you &apos;re grounded ?  
you said that to me last week .  
how hard is it ?  no shoes on the furniture !   
argh .  the producer from days of our life left me a message on the machine asking why i wasn &apos;t at the parade !  they say everybody is very pissed off at me and they all got to meet santa !   
it &apos;s ok .  i thought of the perfect lie for you .  it &apos;s easy to remember and it doesn &apos;t invite alot of questions .  you weren &apos;t at the parade ,  because you had a family emergency .  
oh .  .  . i like that !  yeah !  i wasn &apos;t at the parade because i had a family emergency .  
ooo .  .  . what happened ?  
er .  .  . my sister &apos;s raccoon came .  .  .  .  .   
wha .  .  . wait what are you doing ?  
setting the table .  
i thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too .  
oh .  . how nice !  maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress 
hey dude ,  you ok ?  sorry bout before .  
you know ,  this is .  .  . this is classic rachel .  
erm .  .  . i &apos;m a decorator ?  ?

and .  .  . and you know what ?  you wanna know why i &apos;m not giving emily to you ?  
emma .  
well ,  how hard could it be ?  you do it .  
do i know why you don &apos;t want me to have the baby ?  because you don &apos;t want me to be happy !  you have always been jealous of me .  
y &apos;know ,  you &apos;re just ,  you &apos;ve always been like this .  you just .  .  . you had to have everything and i couldn &apos;t have anything .  like in junior high ,  when you stole timmy from me .  .  . i mean do you even realize how much that hurt me ?  
oh come on ,  that was twenty years ago ,  get over it .  
yeah ,  y &apos;know what i cannot believe ?  that my so - called sister ,  gets a thirty percent discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail ?

what ?  
this doesn &apos;t feel weird !

hm - hmm !  
okay !

yep !  
do you wanna do it at the same time ?  
count of three ?  
one !  
two !  
three !   
well i think it &apos;s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined .  
eh ,  we weren &apos;t that close anyway !  
so ,  are you really gonna go out with that nurse man ?  
well uh ,  you and i are just goofing around ,  i thought ,  why not just goof around with him .  
y &apos;know ,  i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary .  .  .  well ,  i have ,  and the technical definition is ,  two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together .  but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me ,  then we have to ,  y &apos;know ,  get you my original dictionary .  i am *so* bad at this .  
i think you &apos;re better than you think you are .  
really ?  okay ,  so .  .  .  
 know when to stop .  
y &apos;know ,  i sensed that i should stop .  so we &apos;re okay ?  
yeah .  (they kiss and as she starts to leave ,  chandler starts

that &apos;s stealing !  
no ,  we &apos;ll - we &apos;ll bring it back !  just put it under your dress .   
ohh .   
listen umm ,  i &apos;ve been thinking ,  it &apos;s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding .  i mean ,  you work ,  you work really hard for that .  
ehh .  
eh ,  you work for that .  
look ,  i thought about it too ,  and i &apos;m sorry .  i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .  
you do ?  !  
yeah ,  i &apos;m putting my foot down .  yeah look ,  when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy ,  and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy ,  then ,  then that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .  
oh ,  you &apos;re so sweet .   oh ,  but wait ,  what about our ,  what about the future and stuff ?  
eh ,  forget about the future and stuff !  so we only have two kids ,  y &apos;know ?  we &apos;ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .  
you thought about that ?  
yeah .  
how many kids were we gonna have ?  
uh ,  four ,  a boy ,  twin girls and another boy .  
what else did you think about ?  
well ,  stuff like where we &apos;d live ,  y &apos;know ?  like a small place outside the city ,  where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .  y &apos;know ,  we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .  of course ,  we &apos;d have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .  
 y &apos;know what ?  i - i don &apos;t want a big ,  fancy wedding .  
sure you do .  
no ,  i want everything that you just said .  i want a marriage .  
you sure ?  
uh - hmm .

mine &apos;s is to lilian myers .  
actuary .  .  .  no .  book - keeper .  .  .  no .  topless dancer .  .  .  (he looks down on himself ,  checking ,  then nods satisfied and marks the realized ?  you are the sole wage earner .  *you* are the head of the household .  i don &apos;t do anything  -  i &apos;m a kept man !  
hey !  
good morning ,  tiger !  i &apos;m making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight .  you &apos;re gonna get me good and pregnant .  
i &apos;ve got nowhere to go this morning .  i &apos;m unemployed !  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do with my life .  
well ,  i just lost my erection .  
i mean ,  what am i supposed to do with myself ?  
you &apos;re supposed to find your passion in life .  you can be whatever you wanna be now .  it &apos;s exciting .  
but it &apos;s all so overwhelming .  i don &apos;t know where to start .  
hey ,  wait a second .  i can help you with this .  you just need to be organized .  we can make a list of your qualifications ,  and categorize jobs by industry .  there could be folders and files !  
hey !  this is where your hyper - organized - pain - in - the - ass stuff pays off !  
 thank you !  
joey ,  can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin ?  
okay .  phoebe thank you .   thank you !  
pheebs ,  have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  it &apos;s just ,  i &apos;m a little short on cash .  
if you want i could loan you some money ?  
oh no ,  no ,  no .  i learned never to borrow money from friends .  no ,  that &apos;s why richard dreyfuss and i don &apos;t speak anymore .  
oh ,  hey ,  how about this ?  wanna be an extra on my show ?  
you could do that ?  
yeah ,  yeah .  the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need .  
oh my god ,  i &apos;m gonna be on tv !  
okay ,  now .  i gotta tell you ,  being on tv isn &apos;t as glamorous and exciting as you think .  
oh ,  really ?  
no it is awesome !   
hi guys .  
wow !  hey ,  why are you all dressed up ?  
rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone .  doesn &apos;t she look cute ?  
she sure does .  why does she have a pink bow taped to her head ?  
well ,  because if one more person says  &quot; what a cute little boy &quot;  i &apos;m gonna whip them with a car antenna !  
 okay ,  i have looked through a bunch of career guides ,  photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision .  
how long was i in there ?  
okay .  let us start with the a &apos;s .  advertising .  
wait .  advertising !  that &apos;s a great idea !  
don &apos;t you want to look through the rest ?  
i don &apos;t think i have to hear the rest .  advertising makes perfect sense .  sorry you had to waste all this time ,  though .  
you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time ?  ooh ,  now i get to use my shredder !  
i mean ,  i can write slogans .  i mean ,  how hard can it be ,  right ?   &quot; cheese .  it &apos;s milk that you chew .  &quot;   &quot; crackers .  because your cheese needs a buddy .  &quot;   &quot; a grape .  because who can get a water melon in your mouth ?  &quot;  
i got one .   &quot; socks .  because your family &apos;s feet deserve the best .  &quot;  
honey ?  leave it to the pros .  
i actually know someone in advertising .  i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency .  maybe i can get him to meet you ?  give me the phone .  
 &quot; the phone .  bringing you closer to people .  .  . who have phones .  &quot;  
that went well .  almost everybody knew that she was a girl .  
yeah ,  after you punched that one guy who got it wrong ,  word spread .  
who the hell are you ?  
i &apos;m the hell person whose office this is !  
i &apos;m gavin mitchell ,  the person who &apos;s taken over your job .  
joey ,  look at me !  i &apos;m a nurse !  
yes you are .  i think it may be time for my sponge bath .  sorry ,  i &apos;m just so used to hitting on the extras .  so ,  are you excited about your scene ?  
yeah !  but i &apos;m a little shaky and nervous .  
okay ,  okay ,  okay !   you .  here ,  come here ,  here .  you &apos;re gonna take this tray ,  you &apos;re gonna stay on this yellow mark .  you &apos;re gonna move on  &quot; action !  &quot;  you &apos;re gonna walk over to the operating table .  you &apos;re gonna stop on that blue mark ,  you &apos;re gonna put the tray down .  don &apos;t walk too fast !  but don &apos;t doddle .  
cut !  cut !  
well ,  don &apos;t be .  
cut !  
so ,  do you have any other question about advertising ?  
monica warned me you might do that .  i actually think we might have something for you at the agency .  
it &apos;s an unpaid internship .  
come on now .  monica has a good job .  and it &apos;s not like you have a family to support .  
well ,  while you were on your baby vacation i was doing your job .  
clearly you &apos;ve never been to sandles paradise island .  
i can &apos;t say i care too much for that smell you &apos;ve brought in with you .  
excuse me ?  
rach we have a code brown situation .  
can you please ,  please take care of it for me ?  
alright ,  but you have to do one sometime .  
well ,  there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren all together .  
i &apos;m not a temp .  i was transferred here from another department .  
oh ,  they didn &apos;t tell me about your quick wit .  
did they mention that i &apos;m rubber and you &apos;re glue ?  
oh ,  hi mr .  zelner .  us we weren &apos;t sure what we were gonna do .  but then ,  gavin to the rescue .  super gavin !  
well ,  that &apos;s up to mr .  zelner .  i &apos;m sure he will make the right decision .  
 oh ,  wow .  super ass - kissing power .  
you said two weeks .  
hey .  
hey .  so ,  what did he say ?  
well ,  he can be a little rough around the edges ,  so i &apos;m gonna replace friend doesn &apos;t get her puppy act together ,  i &apos;m gonna fire her mother - puppy ass .  &quot;  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i can &apos;t do this .  i &apos;m not an actor .  
that &apos;s right ,  you &apos;re not .  you &apos;re a nurse .  you &apos;re nurse with tray .  
joey .  
no ,  no .  nurse with tray doesn &apos;t know joey ,  she doesn &apos;t have time for friends .  she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor ,  because if she doesn &apos;t ,  people die !  
who dies ?  
 man with eye patch !  you get in there and you do your job .  
yes ,  doctor .  
okay ,  let &apos;s try this one more time .  
and .  .  . action !  
the rest of the scene .  
listen .  sudden change of plans .  my maternity leave just ended .  they told me that if i didn &apos;t come back today ,  they were gonna fire me .  
what ?  no ,  that &apos;s illegal .  i &apos;m gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won &apos;t even .  .  .  
alright ,  alright .  calm down norma rae .  they didn &apos;t actually say that .  i &apos;m just afraid if i don &apos;t come back right now this guy &apos;s gonna try to squeeze me out .  
what about emma ?  we don &apos;t have a nanny .  
i know .  you know ,  we &apos;re just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight .  can you please just take care of her for today ?  
absolutely .  just give me your breast and we &apos;ll be on our way .  
come on ,  i don &apos;t know what else to do .  
fine ,  fine .   we &apos;ll have fun ,  won &apos;t we ?  yes ,  we will ,  yes we will .   
ross ?  
huh ?  
whatever i decide to do ,  i &apos;m gonna be starting a career from scratch .  it &apos;s gonna be a while before i make a living at it .  maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family .  
so you have to tell monica you don &apos;t want to have a baby right now ?  
yeah .  
 good - bye .  
 okay ,  it &apos;s baby time .  pants off bing .   didn &apos;t see you there geller .  
yeah ,  ross is here so .  .  .  
yeah ,  and i was really hoping that i could hang out .  what do you feel like doing ?  
we &apos;re gonna have sex .  
i don &apos;t feel like having sex .  maybe we can watch a movie or something .  
let me put it this way .  we &apos;re having sex whether you &apos;re here or not .  
well ,  i &apos;ve changed your screensaver from that picture of *nsync .  
also ,  i &apos;ve just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow .  
that &apos;s gonna take weeks .  why don &apos;t just let me take care of the presentation ?  
fine .  
hey ,  you &apos;ve been here five years ,  you figure it out .  
hey .  
hey .  
you have a blue tie that would go with this ?  emma spit up on mine .  
oh ,  yeah .  but you have to give it back if i get a job .  of course ,  by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we &apos;ll all be wearing silver jump suits .  
 hi ,  good morning lover .  i gotta say after last night ,  i &apos;m a little weak in the knees .  
here &apos;s an idea .  you walk into a room .  .  . take a quick scan !  
 sorry .   but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night .  
oh god ,  i have to tell you something .  you &apos;re not pregnant .  
what are you talking about ?  
that thing that i have to do to make a baby .  i faked it .  
what !  ?  you faked it ?  
joey ,  listen .  i can &apos;t do this ,  it doesn &apos;t make any sense .  yesterday i was a nurse ,  and today i &apos;m a waitress at a cafe ?  
oh ,  sometimes we use the same extras for different parts .  it &apos;s okay .  
well ,  it &apos;s not okay ,  because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse .  and now suddenly i &apos;m the_waitress ?  that &apos;s gonna confuse my fans .  
maybe you are a nurse ,  but you moonlight as a waitress .  
uhuh .  because i &apos;m a single mother ,  supporting my two children .  
nice .  
wait a minute .  dr .  drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital .  wouldn &apos;t i come over to say hi to him ?  
no ,  no .  see ,  you and drake are having a fight .  
about what ?  
he slept with you and then never called you .  
cut ,  cut !  what are you doing !  ?  
me too !  
 wow ,  you &apos;re here already .  
how do you fix the chair ?  
except that !   oh ,  hello ,  mr .  zelner .  we &apos;re all ready for our presentation this afternoon .  
what ?  i can &apos;t do that !  i have the baby ,  and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour .  to do it now .  ralph needs to leave early today .  he &apos;s going helicopter shopping .  
you can do the presentation .  
i &apos;ll watch her .  
because you &apos;ve worked really hard ,  and it &apos;s your job ,  and you &apos;re a little crazy .  
i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable .  
okay ,  okay .  but this is her last chance .  
thank you ,  thank you .  how about i do something for you ?  tomorrow ,  i &apos;ll bring you a hat ,  cover up the bald ?  
hey ,  listen pheebs .  i was just talking to the_director ,  and he was thinking ,  maybe this time you don &apos;t hit drake ,  you just wait on the tables ?  
i can &apos;t do that .  i &apos;m an actor .  i have a process .  
you &apos;re a masseuse .  you have a table with a hole in it .  
wait a minute ,  i see what &apos;s happening here .  you &apos;re threatened .  
what ?  
yeah ,  i &apos;m so good in this scene that i &apos;m stealing focus from you .  well ,  rise to the challenge tribianni  &apos;cause i just raised the bar .  come join me up here !  
you faked it ?  you couldn &apos;t have faked it !  
oh yes you can .  you just make the faces and the noises .  
guys can fake it ?  unbelievable .  the one thing that &apos;s ours !  besides ,  why would you fake it when we &apos;re trying to have a baby ?  
that &apos;s actually why .  look ,  i &apos;m starting a whole new career now ,  and i &apos;m not saying that i don &apos;t want to have a baby ,  i &apos;m just saying maybe we could wait a little while .  
like a month ?  
or a year ?  
really ,  you want to wait a year ?  
it could be less than a year .  i mean ,  you &apos;ve heard my stuff .   &quot; pants .  like shorts ,  but longer .  &quot;   it &apos;ll probably be more than a year .  
i really wanna have a baby .  
yeah ,  me too .  look ,  i &apos;ll just get my old job back .  
no ,  i want you to have a job that you love .  not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration .  
i quit and you learn what i do ?  
it &apos;s just ,  i think ,  there &apos;s never gonna be a right time to have a baby .  i mean ,  now you &apos;re unemployed and in a little while you &apos;ll find a new job that &apos;ll keep you really busy .  there &apos;s always gonna be a reason not to do this ,  but i think once the baby comes ,  forget about all those reasons .  
i guess .  it &apos;s always gonna be scary when we have a baby .  
it &apos;s gonna be really scary .  i mean ,  god .  when we have a baby ,  there &apos;s gonna be so much that we &apos;re not able to control .  i mean ,  the apartment &apos;s gonna be a mess ,  i won &apos;t have time to clean it .  what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer ?  messes up all the ribbons ?  !  what if there &apos;s no room for a ribbon drawer ,  because the baby &apos;s stuff takes up all the space !  ?  where will all the ribbons go !  ?  !  
should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?  
yes ,  please !  
oh ,  and i promise ,  i will not fake it this time .  
hey 
hey .  so where &apos;s mon ?  
oh ,  she &apos;s at home ,  putting up decorations for rachel &apos;s birthday party tonight .  
and you &apos;re not helping ?  
i tried ,  but apparantly singing  &quot; i will survive &quot;  in a helium voice  -  not helping .   
hey you guys !  
shhh don &apos;t say that loud ,  gunther &apos;s gonna want to hug me .  
hi .   
ooh ,  somebody &apos;s getting a little fussy .  
you damn right i am ,  i &apos;ve been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes .  
no ,  you stay ,  i &apos;ll do it  .  
nice to meet you guys  .  
yeah ,  you too .   
oh ,  wow ,  molly is just great !  
yeah .  
yes ,  bravo on the hot nanny .  
what ?  you really think she &apos;s hot ?  
are you kidding ?  if i wasn &apos;t married she &apos;d be rejecting me right now .  
and joey ?  
how do you think she &apos;s doing ?  
am i the only one who doesn &apos;t think that she &apos;s hot ?  ross ?  
eh ,  i mean ,  i mena she &apos;s not unattractive but hot ?  i  .  .  .  .  
thank you !   
now that rachel &apos;s gone ?  
lima .  
you know ,  kinda think of it ,  the capital of peru is  &quot; vtox &quot;  .   oh god !  oh !  
ok ,  i don &apos;t want to freak you out or anything ,  but i think i just saw a rat in your cupboard .  
what ,  is he your pet rat ?  
you can &apos;t keep a rat in your appartment !  they &apos;re extremely unsanitary ,  and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus .  
i don &apos;t know but they don &apos;t sound like spa treatments .  you have to get rid of it !  
thank you .  
hello 
for what ?  
is this your first appology ?  
good morning !  
what ?  
i wasn &apos;t checking her out .  i &apos;m in fashion ,  i was looking at her skirt .  or was it pants ?  i didn &apos;t really see what happened below the ass area .  
why do you even care if i was looking at her ?  are you jealous ?  
i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag .  
huh .  what &apos;s tag &apos;s last name ?  
but it was a deap meaningful relationship .  
it was jones .  
you mean ,  when you were a baby .  
sure .   
would you stop staring at her ?  
i wasn &apos;t staring .  i was leering .  
what &apos;s the big deal with her ?  maybe she &apos;s attractive in an obvious kind of way .  
yeah ,  obvious beauty &apos;s the worst .  you know ,  when it &apos;s right there in your face .  me ,  i like to have to work to find someone attractive .  makes me feel like i earned it .  
looks like joey is doing allright with her .  
 i &apos;m gonna take her back to the appartment .  
bye 
i think it &apos;s sweet .   
 hey ,  listen ,  joey ,  about molly ,  i really prefer if you didn &apos;t go after her .  
why not ?  
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn &apos;t want anything to ,  you know ,  drive her away .  
so ,  what ,  you think i &apos;m just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable ?   yeah ,  sounds about right .  
come on ,  there are plenty of other women out thereok ?  just  -  just forget about her ,  ok ?  just ,  she &apos;s off limits .  
oh ,  man ,  why did have to go and say that for ?  now that you told me i can &apos;t have it makes me want her even more !  
what are you ,  a child ?  
yes !  
joey ,  come on now ,  for me !  please ,  just - just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else .  
fine .   
hey p 
setting rat traps .  
no ,  no ,  to test his neck strength .  
ok ,  ok ,  i &apos;ll throw away the traps .  
better think of a new name for him .  
i don &apos;t know ,  i mean i &apos;m not sure   .  .  .  
maybe it wasn &apos;t bob ,  maybe it was a mouse .  
whazzup ?  ?  
seriously dude ,  3 years ago .  
listen ,  can you do me a favor ?  i &apos;m gonna be out today .  can you just keep an eye on joey ,  make sure nothing happens between him and molly ?  
you don &apos;t trust him ?  
wh  -  no .  some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter ,  the  &quot; hot nanny &quot;  .  
is this really your long term plan ,  for me to run interference ?  because i could get a job any day now .  
you do appear right on the cusp of something .  come on man ,  i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll lose interest in a week or two ,  but for now can you please just do this for me ?  
allright ,  fine ,  but don &apos;t blame me if it doesn &apos;t work .  because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something ,  more often than not ,  he &apos;s going to have sex with it .  
well we gotta do something ,  ok ?  nannies like her don &apos;t grow on trees .   
picturing that tree ?  
where you going ,  joe ?   
for a walk .  
oh .  you mind if i join you ?  
actually ,  that will be long .  you know ,  i really need to organize my thoughts .  
your thoughts ?  plural ?  
allright ,  fine ,  i only have one thought !  it &apos;s about the hot nanny ,  i gotta see her !  
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t let you do that ,  joe .  
now you &apos;re telling me i can &apos;t see her ?  ?  you guys are killing me !  she &apos;s forbidden fruit !  it &apos;s like  .  .  .  like she &apos;s the princess and i &apos;m the stable boy  .  .  .  why are you doing this ,  huh ?  did ross tell you not to let me go over there ?  
yes ,  as a matter of fact he did ,  so i can &apos;t let you go .  
huh .  interesting .  now there are obstacles .  hot nanny and me against the world .  this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of .  
great novels ?  
gavin mitchelle &apos;s office .  
hey mom !  no ,  that &apos;s just my secretary .   
mom ,  i &apos;ll call you later .  yeah .   yes ?

oh ,  you &apos;re welcome for the party .  i &apos;m glad you &apos;re having a good time .  
god ,  i hope he doesn &apos;t show up .  of course he &apos;s not gonna show up ,  the guy hates me .  
does he ?  
what ?  
maybe he &apos;s bothering you so much because he likes you .  it &apos;s like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me ?  
 she &apos;s out ,  i &apos;m gonna take her home .  
oh ,  ok ,  thank you .   do you see what all the guys see in her ?  
wouldn &apos;t kick her out of bed .  no more vodka for me !    
hey rach ,  so can i sing happy birthday to you now ?

hey rach ,  somebody got you shoes !  
oh ,  give me !   
yeah .  we have rat babies now .  
ahhhh  ,  you brought rats to my birthday party ?  
so this is what a stroke feels like .  
i had to bring them !  we killed their mother ,  they &apos;re our responsibility now .  you know ,  they require constant care .  you should know that ,  rachel ,  you &apos;re a mother .  
are you comparing my daughter to a rat ?  
no !  seven rats !  i think we should take them home ,  we need feed them .  
whhh wait ,  you &apos;re gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats ?  
well i &apos;m sorry rachel ,  but i &apos;m not like you ,  ok ?  not everyone can afford help .    
where the hell are joey and molly ?  i asked you to watch them .  
 i &apos;m sorry ,  i got a little occupied .  
we have to stop them before something happens !  
so where did you study ?  
no ,  where did you study acting ?  
molly  .  .  .  people don &apos;t study acting  .  .  .   
sure ,  i &apos;ll go check on emma .  
thanx .   
 will the stable boy never get the princess ?  ?  
what do you think you &apos;re gonna do ,  have sex with her right here on my couch ?  
no  .  .  .  the leather sticks to my ass .  you know ,  this isn &apos;t fair .  what makes you think that i &apos;m just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off ?  huh ?  can &apos;t you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her ,  and might want something real ?   look ,  the truth is ,  i haven &apos;t felt this way about anyone since rachel ,  ok ?  i didn &apos;t think i could ever love again .   
hi ,  is molly here ?  
 hey !  guys ,  this is tabatha  .   i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .  
ok  .  .  .   well ,  uh ,  joey ,  i guess we have no problem .  
hey ,  when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats ?  
ok ,  fine ,  these rats are our responsibility .  what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them ?  
yeah  -  not such a problem with rats .  no ,  they &apos;re more of a  &quot; love the one you &apos;re with &quot;  kind of animals .  
well ,  i know this is gonna sound crazy ,  but ,  we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives .  
it &apos;s gonna be ok .  
no ,  i think you &apos;re sweet .  
hey !  
hi .  thanks for the party ,  honey .  should i help you clean up ?  
no way !  you had your party ,  now i have mine !  is everything alright ?  
yeah ,  i just get a little bummed when my birthday &apos;s over .  
well ,  at least you have one thing to be happy about .  that jerk gavin from your office didn &apos;t show up  .  
yeah ,  hey .   
oh ,  we weren &apos;t talking about you .  no ,  no way to recover .  
nice party .  
well ,  it was ,  and you would have seen it if you didn &apos;t showed up at   .  .  .  ?  ?  god !  oh ,  this party was lame  .  .  .  
look ,  i &apos;ll just give you this and go .  
well ,  let me explain how birthday parties usually work .  there are presents ,  and a cake ,  perhaps a fourth or fifth person .  ok ,  i  .  .  .  got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier .  
i really mean it .  
you don &apos;t mind ?   well ,  what do you know ,  it fits !  
i &apos;m not sure .  
i do have feelings for you .  
yes ,  i feel that you are a little annoying .  
see ?  why ,  gavin ,  why ?  right when i &apos;m about to change my opinion of you ,  you go and you  .  .  .   and you do that  .  .  .    ending credits 
 first i was afraid ,  i was petrified  
 hey 
 hi 
listen ,  i think i &apos;ve left something here .  
oh ,  well someone left this  .  this is yours ?  
 no ,  but i like it .  i think i left one of my rat babies .  
oh ,  uh ,  well ,  i haven &apos;t seem it but if i do i &apos;ll let you know .  
ohmygod !  rat baby !  rat baby !  rat baby !   
hey !  
yeah !  yeah !  ok !  sure !  look !  can we .  .  . can we talk about what happened here last night ?  
sure !  just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you !  do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn &apos;t do  .  .  . i mean come on !  !  
ok you .  .  . you really don &apos;t know what i am talking about ?  
no !  
ok !  last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony .  
our balcony ?  seriously ?  that &apos;s so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony .  and she said  &quot; no ,  no .  it &apos;s too cold ,  nobody will go out there .  &quot;  and i said  &quot; maybe if we put some light out there they will &quot;  
right that &apos;s why i came over to talk about .  hum .  .  . i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony ,  even though there were no lights  !  
so are you gonna .  .  . talk to her ?  
why .  .  . why should i ?  i mean if she wants to move on ,  that &apos;s fine !  
you know when  &quot; that &apos;s fine &quot;  sounds true when someone yells it and spits !  
no i &apos;m serious .  i mean she wants to date people ?  fine !  i don &apos;t care but .  .  . at least she could have told me .  you know i .  .  . i &apos;ve been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows ,  then so will i  !  very funny !  ross is gay !  ah !  ah !  
no no no .  good .  so you &apos;re moving on ?  do you have any idea where you &apos;re moving ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean i have plenty of opportunity .  just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me .  and then the other day on the subway a woman  &quot; accidentally &quot;  sat on my hand .  
dude ,  don &apos;t rub my face in your crazy single life !  
well ,  and how about this ?  there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter - departmental potluck dinner .  
hey !  let me ask you guys something .  i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks i should have my eyebrows waxed .  is that weird for a guy ?  
well it depends .  
on .  .  .  ?  
on how far along he &apos;s in the sex change process !  
no i totally disagree .  no i think it &apos;s fine for a guy to do something like that .  such you an actor .  not that you need to ,  your eyebrows are .  .  .  
ok !  stop it you guys !  stop staring !  you &apos;re freaking me out !  
your knuckles are kinda hairy too .  .  .  
oh man !  i have to get those done too ?  !  
wow !  talking about high maintenance 
hey hey !  you dye your hair !  
i &apos;m a woman !  
arghhh !  double standards !  
oh before i forget ,  are you coming to mike &apos;s piano bar tonight ?  
only if i don &apos;t have to get up and sing .  
but everybody sings .  it &apos;s so much fun !  last time this adorable old man got out there ,  forgot all of the words ,  flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage .  so funny .  
it &apos;s just ,  i &apos;m not good at singing .  
oh !  what &apos;s the matter ?  are you scared ?  you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m a better singer ?  you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m gonna beat you at singing ?  
no no ,  it &apos;s not working on me .  wow !  i must be growing up !  
ok fine !  please come and support mike .  you don &apos;t have to sing .  
so i don &apos;t have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others ?  
while drinking .  .  .  
i &apos;m there !  
hi guys !  listen i really need your help .  i think i did something really stupid .  
well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there 
no not that .  i kissed gavin last night .  
oh my god .  
you kissed him ?  
yeah .  it was after the party ,  we were on the balcony and .  .  .  
wait wait wait .  i was at home the whole time .  how did i missed that ?  
it was the end of the party ,  you were probably ironing wrapping paper .  
oh yeah .  .  . so how did you end up kissing ?  
you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and ,  oh and he gave me this scarf .  .  .  
i thought you hated him ?  
you know honey ,  there is a thin line between love and hate ,  and it turns out that line .  .  . is a scarf !  
so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy ?  
i don &apos;t know .  it &apos;s so complicated .  i work with this guy ,  you know ,  i have the baby ,  and i have ross ,  and i just .  .  . i don &apos;t know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes .  
sounds like you need to think about what you want ,  talk to gavin ,  and you definitely should talk to ross 
or .  .  . i could call in sick and not deal with it at all .  .  .  
hey .  i &apos;m here for my eyebrow appointment .  
chandler bing .  will be right with you .  
i &apos;ll take care of it 
oh absolutely .  
are you looking to meet somebody ?  
we &apos;ll get to the wax in a minute .  first i want to tweeze some of the strays ,  ok ?  this may sting just a little bit .  .  .  
hey it &apos;s the most eligible man in ny .  how &apos;s the moving on going ?  
not well .  i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants .  
well maybe you &apos;re going about this the wrong way .  you know i mean think about it .  single white male ,  divorced three times ,  two illegitimate children .  the personal ad writes itself .  .  .  .  
that &apos;s funny .  .  . do you think you &apos;ll ever work again ?  
what are doing ?  you know i can only dish it out !  
i can &apos;t believe rachel just moved on and didn &apos;t say anything to me 
maybe she didn &apos;t move on ,  you know .  .  . maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one - time birthday thing 
no no ,  about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar .  
did she go out with him ?  
no .  when he called ,  i .  .  . i threw the message away .  
ah !  the high road .  .  .  
you know what ?  enough !  enough talking !  i have to get moving !  hey check out those two blondes over there !  hey come with me !  
are you trying to get everybody divorced ?  
you don &apos;t have to do anything .  it will just be easier if it is the two of us ,  like college ,  remember ?  you .  .  . you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you &apos;re the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation ,  so they &apos;ll see that i &apos;m the brilliant ,  brooding ,  sexy one .  .  .  
i thought i had to make the jokes !  
don &apos;t you have to be at work ?  
oh come on !  hello !  hi !  my name is chandler ,  here &apos;s my friend ross right here ,  and we were wondering you know if you &apos;re up for it .  we only need six more people for a human pyramid .  .  . swoop !  !  swoop !  !  
hum .  .  . so .  .  . hum .  .  . oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper .  .  . another would you rather drown or be burnt alive ?  &quot;  
gavin !  i brought you some soup .  
i heard you were sick .  .  .  
i missed you at work today .  how are you feeling ?  
oh !  good !  because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i thought you called in sick to avoid me .  
so i had fun last night 
exactly how contagious is this thing you have ?  i mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you ?  
do you have fever ?  let me see .  hum .  .  .  
what &apos;s ross doing to you on that picture ?  
right .  right .  ross .  so what &apos;s the deal with you guys ?  i don &apos;t want to get in the middle of anything 
yeah !  but you said not to worry about .  .  .  
hi !  
no i &apos;m here to take emma to your mother &apos;s ,  remember ?  
don &apos;t panic !  
there is a man behind your curtain .  i have a mace in my purse .  
hello !  i just go and get emma .  
so hum .  .  . why did i have to hide ?  
so what if it was ?  i thought there was nothing going on between you two .  .  .  
you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time .  i used to be a rodeo clown .  
it &apos;s ok .  i know it &apos;s probably not my place but can i give you a piece of advice ?  
i think you should talk to ross about all this .  
don &apos;t be .  it &apos;s just bad timing .  
oh she &apos;s my girlfriend .  that &apos;s not just how we do it here .  i got to get a break and when we come back we &apos;ve got kenneth singing  &quot; i touch myself &quot;  .  .  . i &apos;m not here to judge !  
hi hi .  .  . oh you have got to sing .  
no i told you i can &apos;t .  
but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice .  
what have you heard me sing ?  
all the time when you &apos;re cooking .  
what ?  
yeah you &apos;re always singing  &quot; yummy yummy yummy ,  i &apos;ve got love in my tummy &quot;  
yeah i do rock that one .  
ok so isn &apos;t there a little part of you that wants to get up there ?  
well i &apos;ve got a book around .  .  .  
you already hit on me an hour ago 
right ,  so that &apos;s a firm  &quot; no &quot;  .  i cannot believe this ,  i just keep striking out .  
i don &apos;t get it neither ,  i mean you &apos;re obviously desperate ,  you &apos;re asking women how they want to be killed 
this is great .  rachel &apos;s gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i &apos;m gonna die alone .  
all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back .  i mean ,  am i so unlovable ?  
well .  .  .  
all right ,  that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of  &quot; i touch myself &quot;  .  coming up next we &apos;ve got monica singing  &quot; delta dawn &quot;  .  
wait wait !  i can &apos;t sing in front of all these people .  
just pretend they &apos;re not even here !  it &apos;s ok monica ,  when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won &apos;t see anyone anyway .  
hi !  i &apos;m monica and i &apos;m gonna be singing  &quot; delta dawn &quot;   &quot; delta dawn ,  what &apos;s that flower you have on ?  could it be a faded rose from days gone by ?   .  .  .  &quot;  
like an x - ray .  bad day not to wear a bra .  
hey ,  i need your help .  
wow ,  it seems serious .  what seems to be the problem ,  ashley judd ?  
look ,  i &apos;ll get new headshot taken ,  all right ,  so i want to get my eyebrows shaped 
i am sorry ,  moment to make fun of that ,  please !  
you may be a sissy but i &apos;ll still  .  all right ,  it hurts so bad ,  i could only let her do one eyebrow and now .  .  .  they dont match !  
its like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama !  
all right ,  look ,  you got to help me out ,  ok ?  look ,  i have the magic marker ,  i want you to fill in the skinny one so i dont look stupid for my pictures .  
ok .  first of all ,  this is green !  
what the hell am i supposed to do !  
all right ,  i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you .  
what ,  what .  
ok ,  you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage ,  well i earned mine by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his business partners .  
oh my god !  
yeah ,  well ,  i guess you dont need my help victor victoria !  
ok all right ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  i do ,  i do ,  i do ,  i need your help ,  but chandler i dont know if i can take anymore plucking .  it hurts so bad !

every little bit of you !  
sure .  
mon &apos; ,  not that you didnt sound good ,  but .  .  .  
thank you so much for letting me do this .  public bathrooms freak me out ,  i can &apos;t even pee ,  let alone do anything else .  
its so amazing i met you the same day that eric broke up with me ,  because its like you lose a boyfriend ,  you get a boyfriend .  
no dont worry ,  this is not some rebound thing .  i am totally over eric .  
 .  good choice ross .  
oh ,  hey !  hi ,  there you are ,  ive been looking for you everywhere !  
oh ,  yeah ,  hello ,  well ,  now ,  here i am .

ah ,  who is emma ?  
and done !  
oh my god !  i didnt feel a thing  !  hey ,  are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the saloon 
thanks .  you wanna see what it looks like ?  
yeah ,  yeah .  hey ,  they totally match !  they look great !  they look great !  how you doing !  
yeah ,  yeah ,  i think it looks pretty good .  i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right about there ,  but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate .  
thank you so much .  
no problem .  
listen thats a pretty girly hour we just spent ,  we should add some manly make up for it .  
yeah .  
ok ,  for my next song i think ill sing something a little more upbeat .  all right ?  oh ,  how about the pointer sisters i am so excited .  and make it bouncy !  
oh youll probably take care of that on your hands .  
i am sorry i am late .  youll understand when youll see joey .  
honey ,  youre just in time ,  im about to sing another song !  
really ?  in front of all this people ?  
and they love me !  
oh my god !  
yes ,  she gives the people what they want .  
all right ,  watch !  
 &quot; tonight &apos;s the night we &apos;re gonna make it happen ,  tonight we &apos;ll put all other things aside .  give in this time and show me some affection .  .  .  &quot;  
are those my wifes nipples ?  
oh ?  isnt that funny ?  i didn &apos;t see that before ,  i wouldn &apos;t have let her go up again .  
i gotta stop this .  
oh ,  who cares ,  they still love me !   &quot; i am so excited .  .  .  &quot;  
ross ,  you didnt tell me you were a doctor !  
actually about an hour and a half .  
you feel that too ?  oh ,  i thought that was just me !  
hey ,  do you want to go away this weekend ?  
well see .  
ok ,  ross ,  whats going on here ,  are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now ?  
i dont know ,  are we just kissing guys on balconies ?  
how do you know about that ?  
emma .  
when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know ,  for what ?  a week ?  
no ,  actually ,  see i had to pee ,  cause i cant use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites .  
well ,  call me !  
no ,  wait ,  you dont have my phone number !  
you know ,  if its meant to be ,  ill guess it .  bye ,  bye .  
score .  
oh ,  i am sorry ,  did you not like her ,  because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony .  
oh god ,  i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this .  it was one kiss ,  one guy ,  one time !  
oh ,  really !  
yeah .  
oh ,  really !  
oh yeah .  
what about the guy from the bar ?  
what ?  who ?  
the guy you gave your number to .  
whoa ,  how do you know about that ?  
because he called here looking for you .  so dont tell me this .  .  . this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing ,  ok ?  youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now .  and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me .  
why didnt i get that message ?  
what ?  
from the guy in the bar ,  why didnt i get that message ?  
because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket .  do you .  .  . do you not look there ?  
ross ?  
i never gave it to you .  
why ?  
i dont know .  
oh god .  you know what ?  who you think you are ?  who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get ?  
who am i ?  
yes .  
i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys !  
oh my god ,  i cannot believe this .  you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us !  but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment !  
none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me !  thats not the point .  ok ?  the point is you .  .  . you are the one who moved on and didnt tell anyone !  
oh ,  ross ,  this is just so messed up !  whats wrong with us ?  you know when people hear about our situation they always ask ,  what ,  you live together but youre not a couple ?  and you have a baby ,  isnt that weird ?  and i say no .  you know what ,  its not ,  because it works for us !  but you know this doesnt work .  in fact this is the opposite of working !  
uh ,  clearly .  
and you know ,  we said that we would ,  we would live together as long as this makes sense .  an maybe this ,  you know ,  just doesnt make sense anymore .  
hey !  
hi .  can emma and i live here for a while ?  
ha ,  oh ,  of course .  
thank you .  
your eyebrows look weird .   
morning ,  roomie !  
hey !  you remembered to put clothes on this morning .  
fifth day &apos;s a charm .  
oh ,  joey ,  it &apos;s so great to be back here .  i gotta tell you ,  you &apos;re making it so easy on me and emma .  
hey ,  it &apos;s great having you back .  you know ,  stay as long as you want ,  and when does she stop crying all night ?   
hey ,  you &apos;re not naked !  so hey ,  rach ,  when will we expect to see you tonight ?  
well ,  i &apos;ll probably be back to pick her up around six ,  but she &apos;s in the bedroom all ready to go .  but she did actually fall back to sleep ,  so .  .  .  
she &apos;s probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .  
bye !   
bye !  hey ,  i hope emma isn &apos;t making it too hard on you .  
no ,  hey ,  it &apos;s been great .  
yeah ?  
yeah .  and look ,  i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything ,  all my feelings from before are totally over ,  okay ?  and even if they weren &apos;t ,  when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump .  .  .  
yeah ,  that &apos;ll do it .  
wow !  so ,  how are you ?  
i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m okay .  
really ?  
sure ,  i mean ,  do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out ?  of course .  you know ,  i &apos;m disappointed ,  but it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a divorce .  
well ,  actually it .  .  .  
no ,  it &apos;s not a divorce ,  it is not a divorce !  anyway ,  i think rachel and i need to ,  you know ,  get on with our lives ,  maybe ,  maybe start seeing other people .  
wow ,  really ?  
yeah ,  sure ,  why not ?  in fact ,  if you know anyone that would be good for me .  .  .  
sure ,  i know lots of girls .  
yeah ?  any names come to mind ?  
hey .  
hey .  i was just gonna get something to eat .  you want something ?  
what you got ?  joey see ,  we got strained peas ,  strained carrots .  .  .  ooh !  strained plums .  we haven &apos;t tried that yet .  
goodie !  thanks .  so ,  how is it living with rachel again ?  i mean ,  apart from the great food .  
i &apos;m fine ,  i &apos;m fine ,  it &apos;s just ,  it &apos;s just weird what &apos;s happening with her and ross .  you know ,  yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody .  
oh my god ,  rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too .  
why are they doing this ?  
i don &apos;t know .  they &apos;re so perfect for each other; it &apos;s crazy .  
you know what &apos;s crazy ?  these jars .  what is it ,  like two bites in here ?  
i just wish they &apos;d realise they should be together .  
i know ,  i know .  and when they moved back in together ,  i figured y &apos;know ,  that &apos;s where things were headed .  
i know .  they should be a family .  they should get married and have more children .  
yes ,  and they should name one of their kids joey .  i may not have kids; someone &apos;s gotta carry on the family name .  
you know what ?  maybe once they start dating ,  and they see what &apos;s out there ,  they &apos;ll realise how good they are for each other .  
yeah ,  because it is slim pickings .  still in the bedroom .  
so ,  what are we gonna do ?  are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people ?  
i know; that just pushes them further and further apart .  
yeah .   oh ,  i know what we can do .  we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates ,  so that they &apos;ll realise how good they are together .  
ooh ,  that &apos;s a great plan !  
yeah ,  you know what the best part of it is ?  i get to do my  &quot; plan - laugh .  &quot;    
hey !  
hey !  
you guys aren &apos;t doing anything tonight ,  are you ?  
see ,  now ,  why would you assume that ?  just because we &apos;re married ?  i will have you know that we are very hip ,  happening people .  now ,  if you &apos;ll excuse me ,  i have to get back to reading the obituaries .  
i was just asking  &apos;cause i need someone to watch emma tonight .  
sure ,  we &apos;ll do that .  what are you up to ?  
well ,  phoebe set me up on a date .  
oh my god .  
wow .  
why ?  what &apos;s the big deal ?  
just figured ,   &apos;cause you and ross are .  .  .  
what ,  slept together a year and a half ago ?  yeah ,  i &apos;m all set .  
well ,  i think it &apos;s great that you &apos;re going on a date ,  you know ?  i mean ,  it sounds healthy .  i mean ,  you have needs .  embrace your womanhood !  
you want a job ?  turn off  &quot; oprah ,  &quot;  and send out a resume !  
so i &apos;ll bring her by around seven ?  is that okay ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s perfect .  
ooh ,  joey .  
hey .  
hey .  i &apos;m so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight .  
all right !  who is he ?  
well ,  it &apos;s this guy i used to massage .  and by massage ,  i mean hold down so he wouldn &apos;t turn over and flash me .  wait till you hear who i got for ross .  
oh ,  yeah .   
she &apos;s this really boring woman .  she &apos;s a teacher !

well ,  okay ,  i &apos;ll  -  i &apos;ll just call her and tell her the date &apos;s cancelled ,  and find him somebody else .  
what if we don &apos;t find him somebody else ?  we &apos;ll just tell her the date &apos;s off ,  but we don &apos;t tell ross ,  and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up !  
ooh .  .  . i hear that &apos;s bad .  
ooh ,  so this is great !  rachel &apos;s gonna have a terrible date ,  ross gets stood up ,  and then they &apos;ll realise how good they have it together .

it &apos;s okay .  go take the test and see if we &apos;re okay .  
okay .   
tough crib .  
hey ,  where are all my ovulation - sticks ?  there &apos;s only one here .

chandler !  
uh ,  there &apos;s a drunk chinese guy .  
can i get you another glass of wine ?  
got stood up ,  huh ?  
are you worried your date came ,  saw you ,  and left ?  
we &apos;re okay .  i &apos;m still ovulating .  
oh ,  good ,  because as of four o &apos;clock this afternoon ,  i am not .  
so ,  let &apos;s do this .  
i  -  i don &apos;t think i can .  
come on .  i know you &apos;re not eighteen anymore ,  but give it a minute .  
because of emma .  
oh my god ,  emma .  oh ,  sweetie ,  i forgot you were here .  oh ,  you &apos;re right ,  we can &apos;t do this .  we can &apos;t leave her alone .  
sorry .  
unless .  .  .  maybe we do it here .  i mean ,  how much can she even be aware of at this age ?  
well ,  she &apos;s aware when we leave the room .  she may notice if we start .  .  .  canoodling in it .  
canoodling ?  
well ,  i can &apos;t say  &quot; hump &quot;  or  &quot; screw &quot;  in front of the b - a - b - y .  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  i guess having sex in front of a baby isn &apos;t so .  .  .  
horrifying ?  scarring ?  something people go to jail for ?  
i guess you &apos;re right .  
you guess i &apos;m right ?  when we stayed at that bed and breakfast ,  you wouldn &apos;t have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window .  
wow ,  everything looks so good !  i think i &apos;m gonna have the chicken .  to say this; you &apos;re really beautiful .  
i &apos;m kind of funny looking .  
i &apos;m not funny either .  so ,  if you were thinking ,   &quot; well ,  he &apos;s not that good - looking ,  but maybe we &apos;ll have some laughs &quot;  .  .  .  that ain &apos;t gonna happen .  
i silk - screen t - shirts now .  
i do like my hair .  
hello ?   
phoebe ,  it &apos;s me .  i &apos;m going to hunt you down and kill you !  
hey ,  rach !  
this is the worst date ever .  how could you set me up with this creep ?  
you know ,  you are talking about one of my dear ,  dear friends .  
i don &apos;t care !  this guy is a nightmare !  
oh ,  right ,  so he gets a little crazy when he &apos;s stoned .  
he &apos;s not stoned .  
did he go out for a cigarette ?  
yeah ,  four times .  
my dear ,  sweet rach .   rachel is having a miserable time ,  and ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone .  
oh ,  great ,  pretty soon they &apos;ll be back together .  
she &apos;s asleep .  chandler ?   
what are you doing ?  
emma was doing it !  
she &apos;s asleep .  
ooh ,  she &apos;s asleep ,  that means we can .  .  .  
yes ,  but we have to be fast .  can &apos;t make any noise .   
hello ?   
emma ?  hey !  hi !

ooh .  .  .

eh ,  okay ,  the waiters have a little pool going .  we have a bet on how long it &apos;ll take before you give up and go home .  
well ,  if you stay till ,  i am .  
well ,  that was weird .  you were loud ,  and i was fast .  
i think we may have really done it this time .  
oh ,  i wish i didn &apos;t have to wait to take a pregnancy test .  
you may wanna get some more of those too .   
where &apos;s emma ?  
oh my god ,  where &apos;s emma ?  where &apos;s emma ?  
don &apos;t ask me ,  i was in there canoodling you !  
okay ,  okay ,  i &apos;m sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma .  you go look across the hall ,  and i &apos;ll call her cell .  
okay .   
hey ,  you better hope that we &apos;re pregnant ,  because one way or another ,  we &apos;re giving a baby back to rachel .  
crying in front of you .  you must think i &apos;m so pathetic .  
really ?   
don &apos;t touch my coat !   
oh ,  sorry ,  it &apos;s my phone .  hello ?  
oh my god ,  this is the worst date ever !   rachel sorry ,  but did you really think that this was going well ?   what &apos;s up ?  
hey ,  did you stop by here ?

oh my god ,  then .  .  .   
oh ,  thank god !  emma ,  there you are !  
what ?  what do you mean ,   &quot; there you are &quot;  ?  where was she ?  
oh ,  we were playing  &quot; peek - a - boo .  &quot;  she just  she loves it when i &apos;m dramatic .   monica her ?  
because you two were having sex !  
no ,  we weren &apos;t !  
don &apos;t you lie to me !  i could tell by chandler &apos;s hair .   you are so lazy .  can &apos;t you get on top for once ?  
all right ,  all right ,  we were .  we were trying to make a baby .  monica &apos;s ovulating .  
hey !  it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room .  i &apos;m gonna have to tell rachel about this .   
no ,  no ,  no .  
no ,  please don &apos;t .  please ,  joey .  she will kill us !  
hey ,  i gotta !  unless .  .  .  
unless what ?  
unless you name your firstborn child joey .  
what ?  why ?  
hey ,  i may never have kids ,  and somebody &apos;s gotta carry on my family name .  
your family name is tribbiani .  
look ,  i think i know the answer to this question ,  but .  .  .  would you like to make love to me ?  
eh ,  it &apos;s just as well .  doesn &apos;t work anyway .  
all right ,  well that &apos;s good to know .  good night ,  steve .   
hey ,  what &apos;s wrong ?  
i just had a rough night .  
oh .  crab cake ?  
eww !  
well ,  what happened ?  
oh ,  well ,  i .  .  . it &apos;s kind of weird talking to you about this ,  but .  .  .  
monica told me you had a blind date .  
yeah .  
i did ,  too .  
oh .  
but is it technically a date if the other person doesn &apos;t show up ?  
oh ,  oh no .  do you think she walked in ,  saw you and left ?  
why does everyone keep saying that ?  
well ,  if it makes you feel any better ,  i wish my date hadn &apos;t shown up .  
that bad ?  
well ,  he makes t - shirts for a living ,  and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this .   
female body inspector ?  what size is that ?   
now ,  wait a minute .  so ,  they &apos;re gonna name their first child joey ?  
uh - huh .  
how  -  how do i get them to name the next one after me ?  
it &apos;s easy ,  you just walk in on them having sex .  
oh ,  so they owe me like ,  three phoebes .   
oh my god !  look ,  it &apos;s ross and rachel .  oh ,  the plan is working .   
don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t do the plan - laugh .   
the first date we &apos;ve had in months ,  and they were both such disasters .  
oh .  huh .  you know ,  it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn &apos;t even show .  
wait a minute; you don &apos;t think it was intentional ?  i mean ,  that &apos;s just stupid .   
we &apos;re geniuses !  yeah ,  look at them ,  look at them ,  they &apos;re really bonding .  
oh ,  yeah ,  they &apos;re falling in love all over again .   
oh ,  they see us !  oh ,  they ,  they look mad .  oh ,  they figured it out .  they &apos;re coming this way .  run !  
where ?  
can you believe they &apos;re still not here ?  
i know .  a double blind date ,  and we both get stood up .  what are the chances ?  
what ?  
 guys ,  guys ,  i &apos;ve got great news !  guess what 
uh ,  ah ,  monica &apos;s pregnant ?  !

thank you .  i got a job in advertising .   
 oh ,  honey ,  that &apos;s incredible !  
 gosh ,  what &apos;s the pay like ?   oh ,  come on people  come on ,  now ,  if i don &apos;t know who makes the most ,  how do i know who i like the most !   hey joey !   
actually ,  it pays nothing .  it &apos;s an internship .  
oh ,  that &apos;s cool .  we have interns at  &apos;days of our lives &apos; .  
right .  so ,  it &apos;ll be the same except less sex with you .   
so ,  uh ,  what kinda stuff do you think they &apos;ll have you do there ?  
well ,  it &apos;s a training program ,  but at the end ,  they hire the people they like .  
 that &apos;s great .  
yeah ,  i mean ,  there &apos;s probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink ,  you know ,  grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  
 humiliating and noble !   
you know ,  if i didn &apos;t already have a job ,  i think ,  i would have been really good in advertising .  
ross ,  you did not come up with  &quot; got milk ?  &quot;  
 hey !  
hey !  
where &apos;s chandler ?  i wanna wish him good luck on his first day .    .  .  .  and i smelled bacon .

i don &apos;t know ,  but it sounds great .  
your agent called .  you got that audition .  
with lennart haze ?  
yes .  
oh my god ,  that is great !  that is *** for a play on broadway and in a real theatre ,  not that little one underneath the dally like last time .  
is it a good play ?  
well ,  it must be ,  because i read and i didn &apos;t understand a singe word .  
yeah ,  and lennart haze is starring in it 
yeah ,  yeah ,  and directing .  
 he was so good in that movie of macbeth .  
 you saw that ?  
no ,  but i saw the previews .  they played it right before jackass .  faces) ah !  
yeah ,  he &apos;s done some amazing works .  
oh ,  yeah .  oh ,  i loved him in those cell phone commercials .  
 i know .  when the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone .   
hey !  maybe the monkey will be at the audition !  
can i get you a cup of coffee ,  sir ?  
seriously ,  you &apos;re an intern ?  
 dude !  
right .  look ,  i know i &apos;m a little bit older than you guys ,  but it &apos;s not like i &apos;m bob hope   
this is joey tribbiani .  joey ,  these are the producers and ,  as you probably already know ,  this is lennart haze .   
well ,  i &apos;ve i &apos;ve been blessed with a a lot of great roles .  
you making fun of me ?  because i am not a sell - out .   i didn &apos;t do that for the money ,  i believe in those phones .  i almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service .  
really ?  
well ,  i do bring a certain credibility to the role .  
peeeeeooooooooch   &quot; hang up that phone !  &quot;  one take !  
so ,  shall we read ?  
 &quot; what the hell are you still doing here &quot;  ?   
 &quot; bastard &quot;  !

i &apos;m sorry ,  sorry .  you &apos;re not supposed to say  &quot; long pause &quot;  
no .  thank you so much for coming in .  we appreciate it ,  thank you .  
hey !  i - i - i don &apos;t care if he &apos;s hot ,  you know .  if you want to sleep with him ,  do it on your own time .   on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he &apos;s gonna think i &apos;m next door .   
well ,  if you wanna come back at the end of the day today ,  here are my notes .  ready ?  
uhm ,  you &apos;re in your head .  you - you &apos;re thinking way too much .  
 no ,  no ,  no .  it &apos;s that you &apos;re not connected with anything in your body .  there &apos;s no urgency .  the scene is a struggle ,  uhm ,  it &apos;s a race .  also ,  what you did was horizontal .  don &apos;t be afraid to explore the vertical .  and don &apos;t learn the words .  let the words learn you .   
hey ,  do you wanna go to dinner tonight ?  
oh ,  i can &apos;t .  i &apos;ve got a date with that waitress ,  katy ,  yeah ,  i know we &apos;ve been only going out like twice ,  but i have a really good feeling about her .  
alright .  just give me your wallets and there won &apos;t be a problem .  
i have a gun  
alright ,  lady ,  now give me your purse !  
no .  
 what do you mean  &quot; no &quot;  ?  i knew you &apos;d be my death ,  phoebe buffay .   
phoebe ?   oh my god !  
 oh my god !   
ross ,  nice to meet you .   
yeah ,  a real pleasure .  
ough ,  i know ,  but i quit smoking !  
so you look like you &apos;re doing really well !  i guess you &apos;re mugging days are behind you ?  
ouh  
 oh my god .  phoebe ,  you used to mug people ?  
hey ,  how did the audition go ?  
well ,  they wanna see me again this afternoon ,  but ,  err ,  well ,  lennart haze did not like me .   
what happened ?  
well ,  he said i wasn &apos;t urgent enough ,  you know ,  and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical .  oh ,  and he said that i should think less .  
so far so good !   
 honey ,  i &apos;m old !  
 what &apos;s wrong ?  
i am so much older than these other interns .  i can &apos;t compete with them .  
so you &apos;re a little older .  try to look at the positive all this life experience .  
yes ,  but i don &apos;t think life experience with these .   
wooooooooow  it &apos;s like they &apos;re on fire !  
what are they ?   
they &apos;re these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can &apos;t do because no self - respecting adult would ever where these .  
 i give you $ 500 for them !  
what am i supposed to do with these ?  
ah ,  come on ,  sneakers are easy .  you wear sneakers all the time .  
well ,  first of all ,  they &apos;re not called  &quot; sneakers &quot;  anymore .  apparently ,  they &apos;re called  &quot; kicks &quot;  or  &quot; skids &quot;  and i think i heard somebody say  &quot; slorps &quot;  .   roll around  &apos;cause ,  apparently ,  walking is too much exercise .  kids ,  kids ,  roll your way to childhood obesity !   would you help me try to sell these ?  
okay ,  have you considered using a girl with huge knockers ?  
no ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the kinda thing they &apos;re looking for .  
hey ,  hey !  
hey ,  you &apos;ll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged !  
you okay ?  !  
 yah ,  because phoebe knew the mugger !  
 how do you know a mugger ?  
i &apos;m sorry i have friends outside the six of us .  
you wanna know how she knew him ?   because phoebe used to mug people .  
 seriously ?  
well ,  i &apos;m not proud of it ,  but ,  you know sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i 
 phoebe ,  that is awful !  
well ,  ok ,  i wasn &apos;t rich like you guys ,  ok ,  i didn &apos;t eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life ,  my mother was killed by a drug dealer 
you &apos;re mother killed herself !  
she was a drug dealer !  
well ,  anyway ,  it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him ,  because  i was about to do some serious damage !  
 okay 
well ,  this must &apos;ve brought back some really bad memories for you ,  ross .  
why ?  
well ,  ross was mugged as a kid .  
 you were ?  
yeah ,  it was pretty traumatic .  i was outside st .  marc &apos;s comics you know ,  i - i - i was just there minding my own business ,  you know ,  seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week -  
 wonderwoman !  
anyway ,  i was heading towards this bakery ,  you know ,  to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone  your money ,  punk !  &quot;  
 oh my god 
i know !  and - and the worst part was they took my backpack which boy &quot;  
oh yeah !  what was his superpower again ?  
a superhuman thirst for knowledge .  
that &apos;s it .  
well ,  i - i better get to class  are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way ,  phoebe ?  
no actually ,  you might wanna stay away from jane street that &apos;s where stabby joe works .   
okay ,  i think we have a problem here .  
what ?  
well ,  uhm ,  back in my mugging days ,  you know ,  i ,  uhm ,  i worked st .  marc &apos;s comics .  
yeah ?  
well ,  a pipe was my weapon of choice and ,  uhm ,  pre - teen comic book nerds were my meat .  
so ?  
well ,  there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said -  
oh my god !  
you &apos;re late !  
no ,  lennart doesn &apos;t wait !  
 joey !  here we go .  let &apos;s go very quickly !  
 we must go now ,  quickly ,  please .  
ready ?   &quot; what the hell are you still doing here ?  &quot;  
 &quot; oh ,  you sick bastard !  &quot;  
 &quot; what ?  &quot;  
 &quot; then go ,  go !  &quot;  
cut !  that was good .   that was very good .  you did everything i asked for .  
yes .  plus what you &apos;ve got that i don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve got going this squirmy quality that you bring into the character tomorrow for the final callbacks with the *** ,  do all of this what you &apos;ve got going now ,  but  you know what ?   more ,  more .  can you do that ?  
hey !  
hey !  
what are you doing ?  
putting on the sneakers thought i &apos;d get into a younger mindset ,  you know ,  to see if it sparked anything 
oh ,  anything yet ?  
yes ,  how &apos;s this kicked in the nuts for your feet !   
hey !   
probably wanna know what i &apos;m doing  ?  
no ,  that seems about right .  
yesterday at my audition ,  i really had to pee ,  and apparently ,  having to pee makes me a really good actor .  i got a call - back ,  so i &apos;m drinking everything .  oh ,  by the way ,  that egg nog in our fridge was great !  
joey ,  that was formula .  
we gotta get more of that .   
 you know what these aren &apos;t half - bad !   you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren .  
okay ,  first of all ,  that &apos;s stupid and second of all ,  i &apos;m not allowed to talk to ralph .  
alright  i feel youger already !   
 hey ,  you !  
hey !  
hey ,  how was class ?  
no one ever asked me that ,  what &apos;s wrong ?  
nothing ,  i really wanna know .  
oh  well ,  uhm ,  there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene 
 alright ,  nothing is worth this .  uhm ,  i have a confession to make uhm ,  okay ,  you know ,  that girl that mugged you when you were a kid 
 wh - what are you talking about ?  it wasn &apos;t a girl .  it was this huge dude .  
you don &apos;t have to lie anymore ,  ross ,  i know that it was a fourteen year - old girl .  
no ,  it wasn &apos;t .  
yes ,  it was .  
no ,  it wasn &apos;t .  you don &apos;t think i would &apos;ve defended myself against a fourteen year - old 
  &quot; gimme your money ,  punk !  &quot;  
 oh my god ,  it was you !  i can &apos;t believe it ,  you you mugged me ?  
 yeah ,  and i &apos;m so ,  so sorry ,  ross ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  but ,  you know ,  if you think about it ,  it &apos;s kinda neat .   i mean ,  well ,  it &apos;s just that i i &apos;ve always felt kinda like an outsider ,  you know ,  the rest of you have these connections that go way back and ,  you know ,  now ,  you and i have have a great one !  
it &apos;s not the best !  
i know ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  please forgive me .  i don &apos;t know what to say 
 there &apos;s nothing you can say .  that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me .  
really ?  even more humiliating than 
 that &apos;s interesting !  just one thought mention the shoes .  who &apos;s next ?   chander 
 your age ?  
chandler ,  that &apos;s great !  
you see ?  that has a clear selling point .  it appeals to our key demographic ,  it &apos;s  .   you did you come up with that ?  
see all of you tomorrow .    
hey ,  ross !   i know you &apos;re still mad at me ,  but can i just talk to you for a second ?  
sure ,  go ahead .  whoops ,  sorry ,  sure ,  go ahead .   
i just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something i think you &apos;ll find very exciting .   
 oh my god ,  crap from the street ?   
look ,  ross ,  in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell or smoke .   anyway ,  i was looking through it and i found  &quot; science boy &quot;   
oh my god .   i never thought i &apos;d see this again .   it &apos;s all here .  what made you save it all these years ?  
i can &apos;t say ,  i just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day .  
you really thought  &quot; science boy &quot;  was worth saving !  
yeah but you should know ,  i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here .  
still this is amazing oh my god ,  thank you ,  phoebe .  
you &apos;re welcome .  and thank you for  &quot; science boy &quot;  .  i learned a lot from him 
 &quot; i - i - i can &apos;t tell you somethin &apos; i don &apos;t know .  &quot;  
 &quot; i don &apos;t know !  &quot;  
 &quot; alright ,  here ,  you want an answer the answer is  &quot;   
 &quot; she never loved me ,  she only loved you .  &quot;  
absolutely amazing !   the part is yours .  
wow ,  that &apos;s a big cable bill !  huh ,  you don &apos;t have a job ,  but you have no problem ordering porn on a saturday afternoon ?  !   i was in the house !  
 hey ,  uhm ,  phoebe didn &apos;t by any chance mention that 
that she was the huge guy that mugged you ?  yah .  
i see .  you didn &apos;t happen to tell 
did you see our bank statement ?  can this be right ?  
i know .  .  . god .  i haven &apos;t seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double - stuffed oreos .  what happened to all our money ?  
i &apos;m not sure what they did ,  but i &apos;m inclined to blame enron .  
i guess with you doing the internship ,  we &apos;re just spending more than we &apos;re bringing in .  
maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .  
oh ,  but you &apos;re finally doing something that you love !  i can &apos;t ask you to give that up .  though it &apos;d be nice if the thing that you love was y &apos;know .  .  .  finding gold .  
you know what ?  you know what ?  i think we &apos;re making too big a deal out of this .  ok ?  so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things .  and maybe we start eating out of joey &apos;s refrigerator for a change .  you &apos;re chef .  .  .  what can you make out of backing soda and beer ?  
ok worse case scenario is .  .  . we borrow some money from my parents .  
no !  we &apos;re not borrowing money .  
why not ?  
because we don &apos;t do that .  we are bings !  and if there &apos;s one thing my father taught me was .  .  .  well to always knock before going into the pool house .  .  .  but the other thing was never borrow money .  
wow !  i had no idea you had this much pride .  
i &apos;m gonna go .   
i haven &apos;t been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more clothes .  
i put that tube top on as a joke .  
i want to stay too but i &apos;ve gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as i can .  .  
done it .   i &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .  
me too .   you know what ?  i just realised something .  i don &apos;t wanna go home .  
no ,  no !  what i mean is ,  i hate going back to my apartment now .  .  .  and partly because i live above a known crack den but .  .  .  mostly because when i &apos;m there ,  it &apos;s just ,  i really miss you .  so .  .  do you want to move in together ?  
so we &apos;re doing it ?  
yeah !  
hey joey !  
hey !  
listen .  .  . i need to know that what i &apos;m about to ask you ,  will never get back to chandler .   
i &apos;d be lying if i said i haven &apos;t thought about it myself .  chandler is my best friend ,  it would be wrong .  good .  .  .  .  .  . but wrong .  
 ok first of all .  .  . it would be great .  but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m here to talk to you about .  i need to borrow some money .  
aww ,  i don &apos;t know monica y &apos;know .  .  .  erm .  .  .  lending friends money is always a mistake .  
but chandler lent you money !  
and i think he would tell you it was a mistake .  
come on .  .  . i just need it for some rent and .  . and some other bills .  
oh .  .  . how much ?  
two thousand dollars ?  
two thousand dollars !  ?  what do you think i am ?  i soap opera star !  ?  
yeah .  .  .  
that &apos;s right i am !   
hi you guys !  
oo .  .  . what &apos;s in the bag ?  
oh er .  .  .  well you know emma started crawling ?  i realised that this place ,  is very unsafe for a baby .  so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby - proof the apartment .  
oh .  .  . baby - proofing .  .  .  why is this such a big deal now ?  y &apos;know ,  when i was a kid it was like .  .   &quot; whoops !  joey fell down the stairs !  &quot;  or er .  .   &quot; whoops !  joey electrocuted himself again !  &quot;  huh !  
anyway erm ,  are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff ?  
no .  i was just going to do this myself .   
you &apos;re gonna do it ?  
yeah ,  why ?  you don &apos;t think a woman can do this ?  
oh ,  women can .  you can &apos;t .  
monica .  .  . would you please tell joey that he is a pig ?  
you &apos;re a pig .  and you can &apos;t do this .  
wha !  ?  what !  ?  come on !  i found the hardware store all by myself !  
the hardware store is right down the street .  
phoebe and i are moving in together .  
i know it &apos;s so exciting !  you know i &apos;ve never lived with a guy before .  
well you know it &apos;s just like living with a girl .  only they don &apos;t steal your makeup .  unless they &apos;re playing  &quot; this is what my sister would look like &quot;   
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .  
yes dear .  
is that a bit you guys do ?  
uh huh .  .  . we &apos;re playing you two .  
we don &apos;t do that !  tell her we don &apos;t do that !

monica slow down !  ok ?  i &apos;m just excited to be living with him .  you know i mean ,  i don &apos;t know ,  can i see someday being married to mike ?  sure !  yeah .  y &apos;know .  . i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way .  but do i want that house in connecticut .  .  . you know .  . near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior .  .  oh my god i do .  
phoebe ,  i had no idea you were so conventional .  
you ready to go ?

what are you talking about ?  
oh please ,  these guys ,  we haven &apos;t even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns .   
hey joe !  
hey !  
listen er .  . i need to ask you a favor but you can &apos;t tell monica anything about it .  
i thought you didn &apos;t have secrets from monica .  
and that would have made the official party line .   monica and i are having a little financial trouble .  
yeah ,  i know .  
what ?  what do you mean you know ?  
err .  .  .  i just figured it out !  you know ,  i mean you &apos;re not working and the economy is bad .  
oh !  right .  
 that &apos;s the fastest i have ever thought !  
anyway ,  err .  .  .  i need to borrow some money .  
oh !  sure !  how much ?  two thousand dollars ?  
yes !  two thousand dollars exactly !  how do you know that !   
err .  .  . well i .  .  . know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is .   
oh ok .  
 i am on fire !  do you .  .  .   did you write a cheque to monica for two thousand dollars ?  did monica borrow money from you ?  
err .  .  .  kind of .  
i can &apos;t believe her !  did she tell you we were having money problems ?  
oh no no no no no .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t because of your money problems ,  it was for something for her .  
what ?  
something personal .  
excuse me .  
boob job .  
i don &apos;t want her to get a boob job !  that &apos;s crazy !  
well hey ,  i wanna ask you about monica &apos;s little  &quot; groomy &quot;  joke .  
i get the joke .  sophisticated as it was .  now the thing i wanna say is .  .  .  maybe we should have talked about this before .  us living together ,  you &apos;re not expecting a proposal ,  right ?  
yeah well ,  that &apos;s the thing .  for me it &apos;s as far as it can ever go .  
look .  phoebe ,  i - i love you .  very much .  but i never want to get married again .  
it &apos;s just my first marriage was ,  you know such a disaster .  i kind of lost faith in the whole idea .  
at one point near the end she deliberately defecated .  .  .  .  .  
look it &apos;s not about who i would marry .  and i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever .  and i was totally wrong !  
look phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about you .  i just never wanna get married again .  
i &apos;m sorry .  are you ok with that ?  cause if not .  .  . maybe us moving in together isn &apos;t the best idea .  
trust me ,  i will never .  .  .  
hi !  
so you gave in and decided to call someone ?  
you &apos;re all set .

no no !  i just love the way you look ,  i am warm ,  for your form .  
ok .  . you know the old classics you know , you look nice ?  they &apos;re still ok .  
well yes yes .  .  .  you look nice can mean that your face looks nice .  i want to compliment your body .  i mean .  . i wouldn &apos;t change it .  at all .  and more specifically ,  i wouldn &apos;t want anything to get any bigger .  
okay .  .  .  
i mean ,  you wouldn &apos;t want any part of me to get any bigger would you ?  don &apos;t answer that .   
just when you thought that dude couldn &apos;t get any wierder .  
i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger ?  
i don &apos;t know !  i mean ,  what brought that on ?  
oh my god .  we &apos;re trying to get pregnant so he &apos;s probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change .  
no you really think that &apos;s what it is ?  
you heard him !   &quot; no bigger !  &quot;   &quot; you &apos;re perfect !  &quot;   &quot; just don &apos;t get any bigger !  &quot;  oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach .  you know what ?  i &apos;m going to have to talk to chandler .

uh huh .   
hey hey ,  can i help ?  
well !  we er .  . climbed up four flights of stairs ,  manueveored a narrow hallway ,  dodged a rabid pitbul .  .  .  but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky .  
you know sometimes your words .  .  .  they hurt .  
hey uh ,  where do you guys want this ?

the tall girl who wouldn &apos;t sleep with you ?  
uh uh .  .  .  well ,  her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident .  .  .

hey !  how was basketball ?  
oh ,  it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye !  
oh ,  no !  who did that ?  
chandler .  .  .  hey .  .  .   rach .  .  .  what &apos;s hugsy doin &apos; in the crib with emma ?   
she was just crawling around and she found him ,  so i just let her sleep with him .  that &apos;s all right ?  isn &apos;t it ?  
 oh ,  yeah .  .  .  of course .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  it &apos;s a stuffed animal .  .  .  you know .  .  .  it &apos;s for kids .  .  .  not for adults .  .  .  i know that !  
joey .  .  .  are you sure ?  i mean ,  i know how much you love him !  
rachel .  .  .  let &apos;s be clear on this ,  ok ?  i do not love hugsy .  i like him a normal amount .  .  .  
all right .  .  .  oh ,  emma loves him !  
hi .  
hey phoebe .  .  .  how you doin &apos; ?  you feelin &apos; better ?  
breaking up sucks !  oh ,  i really miss mike !  
oh ,  i &apos;m so sorry !  
oh god ,  i tried everything to make myself feel better .  i even tried writing a song about it .  .  .  but .  .  .  i can &apos;t think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh !  !   hey monica ,  i really need your help getting through this .  .  .  
you &apos;re not gonna need my help ?  
well no ,  when i get to the point where .  .  .  you know .  .  .  i &apos;m ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike .  .  .  i &apos;m gonna come to you .  
oh good ,   &apos;cause i &apos;ve already thought of 3 .  .  .  4 !  i &apos;ve just thought of a fourth  
ok .  i mean i know i did the right thing .  you know ,  mike never wants to get married and i shouldn &apos;t be in a relationship that has no future .  .  .  but .  .  .  pretty soon i &apos;m gonna miss him so much .  i &apos;m gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that .  
ok ,  you got it !  
 unless .  .  .  maybe it &apos;s too crazy about this .  .  .  alright so .  .  .  you know ,  there is no future .  .  .  but that doesn &apos;t mean we still can &apos;t have fun .  you know what ?  forget what i said .  
really ?  if that &apos;s what you want .  .  .  
that was a test and you just failed .  
damn it !  rookie mistake !   
 i have sex with dinosaurs ?  ?  
i believe i read that somewhere !  
that only is not funny ,  it &apos;s physically impossible !  ok ?  depending on the species i &apos;d have to have a six foot long .  .  .   it &apos;s not funny !  !  
i respectfully disagree .  
i can &apos;t believe you put that on my alumni page !  
who cares ?  nobody reads those things 
you &apos;d better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today .  
i don &apos;t have a page .  
look at you ,  all sweet and innocent ,  sleeping like an angel .  .  .  with emma &apos;s chubby little hands wrapped around ya .   it &apos;s okay ,  emma ,  you stay asleep .   
 i have a weapon !  
it &apos;s okay ,  it &apos;s okay rach ,  it &apos;s me .  put down the scrunchy .  
what are you doing ?  
well ,  i heard emma stirring ,  so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy .  
oh ,  oh thanks .  alright well ,  now that i &apos;m up i &apos;m going to go to the bathroom .  
alright ,  wait a second ,  why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as .  .  .    &quot; gay as the day is long &quot;  ?  
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs .  
but that &apos;s clearly a joke .  this could easily be true .   
would you get that please ?  people have been calling to congratulate me all day .  
 hello ?  no ,  he &apos;s not here .  yeah ,  this is his wife .  yeah ,  well ,  it came as quite a shock to me too .  i guess i should have known .  yeah ,  i mean ,  he just kept making me watch moulin rouge .  
hang up ,  hang up .  and that was a great movie !   i &apos;m so gonna get back at ross .  .  .  oh yeah ,  this will show him ,  here we go  .  
what are you doing ?  
oh ,  you &apos;ll see my friend .  there .  enter ross] 
 i &apos;m dead ?  
 and so young .  
posting that i died ?  that really isn &apos;t funny .  
well ,  how you died was funny .  
oh please ,  hit by a blimp ?  
it kills over one americans every year .  
unbelievable ,  my classmates are gonna think i &apos;m dead ,  my professors ,  my .  .  .  my parents are gonna get phone calls .  you &apos;re messing with people &apos;s feelings here .  
you wanna talk about people &apos;s feelings ?  you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn &apos;t be able to go with him to key west !  
god ,  i wish mike were here .  
okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing ?   
what are you ,  animals ?  it &apos;s 4 o &apos;clock in the afternoon !  
i gotta call him .  just to talk to him ,  there &apos;s no harm in that .  
phoebe ,  that &apos;s how it starts .  i don &apos;t need to eat the cake ,  i &apos;ll just smell the icing .  .  .  why don &apos;t i just eat a little sliver ,  or ,  okay ,  just a slice or two .  and next thing you know ,  you &apos;re 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide .  phoebe ,  honey ,  i know this is hard .  look ,  if you talk to him ,  you &apos;re going to wanna see him .  and if you see him ,  you &apos;re going to want to get back together with him .  i know that &apos;s not what you want .   give me your phone .  
here .  
and now your cell .  
okay  
this is your cellphone ?

yes ,  it reminds me of a simpler time .  
phoebe ,  where &apos;s your purse ?   
no ,  no !  give it to me !  
you can &apos;t have it .

hey ,  look who &apos;s here !  it &apos;s joey ,  and he brought home a friend .  
joey ,  emma &apos;s right here !  you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore .  
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s not a girl ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  a brand new hugsy !  
oh that &apos;s so great ,  now emma has two hugsy &apos;s .  
no ,  no ,  emma has one hugsy ,  the new hugsy ,  huh ?  the other hugsy ,  i don &apos;t know ,  i guess i &apos;ll just take it back .  
oh you know what ?  when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton .  oh i loved her so much ,  i took her everywhere ,  i would braid her tail .  .  .  
make the transfer !   
should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can &apos;t find it ?  
oh ,  no don &apos;t worry about that ,  i swallowed that years ago .   
oh ,  i don &apos;t think she likes the new hugsy .  
but he &apos;s the same .  
yeah ,  i think she wants the old one back .  
but he &apos;s the same .  
joey ,  come on !  
he &apos;s the same !   .  
haha !  
you know ,  it &apos;s a lot less surprising to do that after i &apos;ve buzzed you into the building .  
so phoebe ,  why are there men &apos;s shoes by the door .  
those are my shoes .  
oh ,  when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping .  
monica ,  i really appreciate you checking in on me ,  but i &apos;m actually feeling a lot better .  yeah ,  i just kinda want to be alone right now .   
who &apos;s that ?   
i ordered chinese food .   
what are the chances ?  1 billion chinese people and they send mike !  ?  
phoebe called me .  
phoebe !  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i broke down .  .  .  i wanted to see him .  
damnit phoebe !  how did you even call him ?  
there is a speakerphone on the base unit .  .  .  
look ,  if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see .  .  .  
oh !  sorry ,  i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name !  
look ,  guys ,  you can &apos;t do this ,  it &apos;s just going to make getting over each other ,  that much harder .  
not if nothing happens .  why can &apos;t .  .  .  why can &apos;t we just hang out as friends ?  
sure !  if you &apos;re just gonna hang out as friends ,  then maybe i &apos;ll join ya .  you know ,  i &apos;m your friend  and mike &apos;s friend  .  
sit down .   
 so how &apos;ve you been ?  
 you look really beautiful .

i &apos;ve missed you too .   
hey ,  ross ,  i just wanted to apologize .  .  .   .  . don &apos;t tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me ?  
uhu uhu ,  check this out .   
huh !  so that &apos;s what i would look like if i worked out .  .  .  and was being serviced by a policeman .  you &apos;re not actually going to send these out are ya ?  
eh .  . actually no ,  i don &apos;t need to because your little  &quot; ross is dead &quot;  joke didn &apos;t work ,  ok ,  there were no responses .  nobody posted anything on the website ,  nobody called my parents ,  so the joke my friend is on you .  nobody called ,  nobody wrote anything ,  nobody cares that i &apos;m dead .   oh my god !  nobody cares that i &apos;m dead !  ?  
no ,  come on ,  you know that &apos;s not true .  
what are you talking about ?  you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet !  i didn &apos;t get one response !  and i &apos;m dead !  
well ,  the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .  
i can &apos;t believe this .  not even my geology lab partner ?  and i carried that guy !   
alright look ,  let &apos;s think about this ,  ok ,  do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time ?  that people are gonna post condolences on a website ?  this is not about people not caring that you &apos;re dead  . this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief .  
you &apos;re right .  there isn &apos;t a decent outlet .  
right ,  i mean ,  come on ,  i &apos;m sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service ,  tons of people would come .  
exactly !  !   
ross ,  what &apos;re you .  .  .  what &apos;re you .  .  .  what are you doing ?  you &apos;re having a memorial service for yourself !  ?  
no !  that would be stupid !  you &apos;re having it for me !  
ross ,  don &apos;t press send ,  don &apos;t press se .  .  .   !  
i &apos;m trying to put emma down for a nap ,  have you seen hugsy ?  
original or crappy ?  
original .  
no ,  sorry haven &apos;t seen him .  
then what &apos;s that big lump under your covers ?  
it &apos;s monica ,  ok ?  
that &apos;s not monica !  
alright !  !  fine !  it &apos;s original hugsy !  no ,  now i know that emma wants him but he &apos;s mine and i need him .  .  
 oh god .  
 .  .  .  she &apos;s being unreasonable !  
 joey ,  there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much  oh don &apos;t cover its ears !   it &apos;s because it reminds her of her uncle joey !  
it does ?  
yeah !  and she &apos;s comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much .  
really ?  she .  .  .  she loves me ?  
oh yeah !  but you know what ?  if you need hugsy ,  don &apos;t worry .  emma will totally understand .  i won &apos;t .  .  .  but whatever  .  
ok ,  wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute ,  i mean rach ,  i mean if if .  .  .   .  if hugsy means that much to emma then .  .  .  well she can have him .  
oooh .  .  .  you &apos;re sweet ,  i knew uncle joey would step up .   look emma ,  look who &apos;s baaack !  
look forget it forget it .  .  .  i can &apos;t do it .  
are you gonna .  .  .  you &apos;re going to take hugsy away from a little child ?  
how do you think i got him in the first place ?  
 
i &apos;ve missed you so much !  no ,  i &apos;m not gonna ask you to get back together because i know we want different things ,  but just to be with you one more night .  
it can &apos;t be any harder than this .  .  .  i mean ,  if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time ,  i .  .  .  i would have stopped to memorize your face ,  the way you move ,  everything about you .  if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time .  .  .  i never would have stopped .  
 kiss him ,  you fool !  !  
what ?  
didn &apos;t you hear that speech ?  if you don &apos;t kiss him then i will !  
oh ,  crap !  
my friend manny .  i asked him to keep me away from you .  
well ,  you are not doing a very good job !  
what &apos;s with the kissing ?  
oh yeah yeah ,  thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing !  
i &apos;ve heard the speech gonna be the last time he saw her .  .  .   &quot;  
you &apos;re weak !  
your pants are undone !  
 where did they go ?  
oh we blew it .  i blame myself .  
it &apos;s been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up !  i tell you ,  when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted !   
there you go !  someone came !  
ok ,  ok !  i &apos;m gonna go hide !  oh ,  this is so exciting ,  my first mourner !    
hi ,  glad you could come .  
hi ,  you &apos;re chandler bing ,  right ?  i &apos;m tom gordon ,  i was in your class .  
thanks .  .  .  uh .  .  .  i &apos;m so sorry about ross ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  
at least he died doing what he loved .  .  .  watching blimps  
who is he ?  
some guy ,  tom gordon .  
i don &apos;t remember him ,  but then again i touched so many lives .   
oh ,  actually i barely knew him .  yeah ,  i came because i heard chandler &apos;s news .  d &apos;you know if he &apos;s seeing anyone ?  
what ?  you .  .  .  you .  .  .  oh !  can i ask you a personal question ?  ho - how do you shave your beard so close ?  
 hey ,  listen .  call me .  
ok !   
 i &apos;m dead and no one cares ?  
i look like a man ?  ?  
please ,  one ridiculous problem at a time !  
it isn &apos;t ridiculous ,  look around !  no one &apos;s here !  
you gave them one day &apos;s notice ,  not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica .  .  .  it &apos;s probably the way you stand !  
yes ,  you &apos;re right .  still somebody must have seen it .  .  .  i mean ,  i went to that school for 4 years ,  i didn &apos;t have an impact on anyone ?  
oh ,  that &apos;s not true .  you had an impact on me ,  i mean ,  it &apos;s 15 years later and we &apos;re still best friends .  doesn &apos;t that count for something ?  
 yeah .  .  .   oh ,  great .  more party boys for chandler !  
hi .  i &apos;m here for ross geller &apos;s memorial service .  
yeah .  .  .  
and you are .  .  .  
chandler ,  chandler bing .  i &apos;m not gay ,  i &apos;m not gay at all .  
you are married though .  
i can &apos;t believe that ross is gone .  it is just so sad .  
we weren &apos;t but we had one class together .  he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science .  i always remembered him .  
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out .  i guess i really missed my chance .  
you sick freak ,  who does that ?  i can &apos;t believe i had a crush on you !   
monica ,  hey ,  can i borrow the porsche ?  
ok .  
alright !  
but ehm .  .  . what is it not ?  
 a place to entertain my lady friends .  
and what else is it not ?  
 a place to eat spaghetti .  
very good !   what do you need it for anyway ?  
oh well ,  the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don &apos;t sell tickets here in new york ,  so .  .  .  
oh !  so you &apos;re driving up to connecticut ?  
yeah connecticut .  .  . not west virginia .  
hey ,  maybe i &apos;ll drive you up there !  i &apos;d like to buy some tickets myself !  
uh !  
yeah with chandler not getting paid ,  we could really use 300 million dollars .  
yeah ,  because if i was at my old job we &apos;d say 300 million ?  no thank you !  
hey will you get me tickets too ?  
yeah me too .  oh !  i have an idea .  why don &apos;t we all pitch in 50 bucks ,  we &apos;ll pool our money together and then if we win ,  we &apos;ll split it !  
no thanks !  
you don &apos;t wanna win the lottery ?  
uh .  .  . sure i do ,  and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart .  
still on amelia earhart ?  
the woman just vanished !  
seriously ,  ross ,  you don &apos;t want in on this ?  
no !  do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery ?  i .  .  . i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times .  
yes but there &apos;s six of us so we &apos;d only have to get struck by lightning 7 times .  
i like those odds !  
seriously you guys ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery ,  i mean that &apos;s such a bunch of boohaki .  
i &apos;ll ask .   boohaki ?  
oh oh ,  we think emma is about to start talking so we &apos;re trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her .  
yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm .  .  . boohaki ,  goshdarnit and brotherpucker .  
how do you know she &apos;s gonna start talking ?  
well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i &apos;m saying .  
kinda like joey .  
god !  look at all these tickets !  it &apos;s so exciting !  you know i haven &apos;t won anything since the sixth grade .  
pie eating contest ?  
oh !  you assume because i was heavy that &apos;s the only way i could win something ?  
no ,  i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries .  
that was a good day !   
they &apos;re towing your car ,  they &apos;re towing your car !  !  
i &apos;m parked in a garage on morton !  
they &apos;re towing a car .  and i am seeing .  .  . spots .  
oh my god ross !  you don &apos;t have emma !  and rachel you don &apos;t have emma !   where &apos;s emma ?  who has emma !  ?  
joey relax !  my mother picked her up two hours ago .  you were there !  
yes and you talked to her .  .  .  
i did ?  
she dropped off a casserole ?  
oh yeah !  the casserole lady .  
so ,  did you come by to watch us win the big bucks ?  
yeah ,  uh .  .  .  and then i figured after you win ,  we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it !   
don &apos;t touch the phone !  i &apos;ll get it ,  i &apos;ll get it ,  i &apos;ll get it !  !   
think he washed his hands ?  
hello ?  hey charlie ,  what do you know ?  
what &apos;s going on ?  
chandler is supposed to find out if he &apos;s getting an assistent job at his ad agency .  but out of the 15 interns ,  they are only hiring three .  
ooh !  tough odds !  
yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery !  
look who &apos;s coming around !  
damnit .  alright call me when you know more .  
did you get it ?  
one of the slots got filled .

yeah .  .  . i mean i want this so much !  i mean ,  i wanna get one ,  i want my friend charlie to get one .  .  . except i don &apos;t care about charlie .   
hey you guys !  ok ,  you &apos;re not going to believe this !  i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight !  
hey that reminds me ,  i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work .  
a psychic and a wishbone ?  guys !  give someone else a chance !  
alright ,  who wants to do it ?  
oh can i ?  vegetarians never get to do the wishbone .  it &apos;s really not fair either !  you know ,  just because we don &apos;t eat the meat doesn &apos;t mean we don &apos;t like to play with the carcasses !  
ok ,  hey rach ?  
oh no ,  i &apos;m good ,  i don &apos;t wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands .  
i &apos;ll do it !  !  it &apos;ll get the casserole stink off of mine .   
i hope i win !  
well ,  it doesn &apos;t really matter  .  .  .  you &apos;re both wishing for the same thing ,  right ?  
i can &apos;t tell you what i &apos;m wishing for !  else .  .  . you know .  .  . won &apos;t come true !  
right !   .  .  but we  &quot; know &quot;  what you &apos;re wishing for !  
can &apos;t really say !  
i understand ,  but you &apos;re wishing for what we think you &apos;re wishing for ,  aren &apos;t you ?  
i &apos;m not really comfortable with these questions !  
one ,  two ,  three !   
i won ,  hey !  
you know what ,  i &apos;m sure your wish is gonna come true ,  but ,  you guys  -  just in case ,  maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp !   ah !  !  that thing gets hot !  !  
you know ,  ross ,  just keep making your jokes .  how are you gonna feel if we actually do win ?  
uh ,  you &apos;re not gonna win .  
oh ,  i know ,  i know ,  the odds are against us ,  but somebody has to win ,  and it could be us !  and then how you gonna feel ?  you know ,  we &apos;re gonna be all like  &quot; oh everybody ,  let &apos;s take our helicopters up to the cape &quot;  and you &apos;re gonna be all like  &quot; oh ,  i can &apos;t guys ,  i &apos;ll meet you guys up there ,  i gotta gas up the hyundai &quot;  
ok ,  i &apos;ve heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that .  
i can see the headline now with regret eats own arm &quot;  .  
why would i eat my own arm ?  
well you wouldn &apos;t ,  but we own the paper ,  we can print whatever we want .  
you know what ,  ross ?  i &apos;m gonna throw in 50 bucks for you .  
why ?  
because i know that you think the lottery is  &quot; boohaki &quot;  but we &apos;re all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun .  and you &apos;re my brother ,  and i want you to be a part of this .  
you don &apos;t have to do that ,  i &apos;ll pay for myself .  but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys  -  that &apos;s so sweet !  come here  
get a room !  
ok ,  so now that you &apos;re in ,  what are you gonna do if we win ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  probably just invest it .  
ooh !  calm down  .  .  .  
seriously ,  that &apos;s your fantasy ?  to invest it ?  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  did i say  &quot; invest it &quot;  ?  i meant  &quot; be cool and piss it all away &quot;   
ooh ,  ooh ,  i know !  we should pool all own money and buy the knicks !  
i don &apos;t really care about the knicks .  
oh ,  you will when i pick you as starting forward .  
 you would do that ?  i never get picked !  
you know ,  i &apos;m not sure a sports team is the way to go .  
you &apos;re not gonna let me buy the knicks ?  ?  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re taking this away from me !  
you &apos;re right ,  it has been you dream for over 15 seconds .  
 uh ,  how long until they announce the numbers ,  mommy ?   
 i &apos;ll take this one too  uh  .  .  .  mommy ?  
oh ,  i &apos;ve gotten into the habit of calling rachel  &quot; mommy &quot;  when we &apos;re around emma .  which i now realize we are not  .  .  .  
i &apos;m hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word .  
although if we &apos;re gonna do that ,  we should probably call me  &quot; daddy &quot;  too .  
oooh ,  i like that ,   &quot; daddy &quot;   
i  .  .  .  i was just talking about rachel .  
 oooh ,  is daddy getting angry ?  is daddy gonna spank me ?  
 well that depends  .  .  .  have you been a baaad gi  .  .   no i can &apos;t .   
hello ?  hello ?  oh ,  hey charlie .  did anybody else hear ?   .  .  .  what ?  susan got it ?  ?  how ?  oh man ,  i would have slept with him !  !   .  .  alright ,  bye .   
dude ,  i &apos;m sorry .  but hey ,  there &apos;s one spot left ,  right ?  
well no ,  charlie &apos;s gonna get that .  
hey ,  don &apos;t say that !  you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job !  
he &apos;s the boss &apos;s son .  
come on ,  lottery !  !   
ooh ,  you guys ,  it starts in like 20 minutes .  
ok ,  here we go .  we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we &apos;ve won .  so does anybody have any ideas how to organize of 40 ,  and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first .  
ooh ,  i have another idea !  
i &apos;m sorry ,  idea time is over .  
ok ,  well ,  are all the tickets in the bowl ?  
yeah .  
what about the ones you have on the nightstand ?  
there are no tickets on the nightstand !  
yes there are ,  i just saw them a few minutes ago .   
un ,  no you didn &apos;t !  you must be mistaken !  
honey ,  there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand !  
chandler ,  sense the tone !  !   
well ,  well ,  well ,  look what mommy found !  !   
ok ,  fine !  !  i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler .  
uh !  the psychic also said that i would be betrayed .  
i can &apos;t believe this ,  i thought we were all in this together !  
hey ,  you just got in 5 minutes ago !  
3 minutes ago !  !  !  i don &apos;t know why that &apos;s important  .  .  .  
i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut ,  when did you even get those ?  
when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic !  
 i &apos;ll show you how .  
ok ,  well monica ,  suppose one of your  &quot; special &quot;  tickets win ?  how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends ?  
please  .  .  .  if i win the lottery ,  you guys are not gonna leave me .  someone gave me a basket of mini - muffins last week and i couldn &apos;t get rid of you for 3 days !  
chandler ,  would you just tell her what she did was wrong ?  
 she &apos;s right ,  you shouldn &apos;t have bought tickets just for us  .  .  .  
ahhh !   
let me finish  .  .  .   however ,  it doesn &apos;t look like i &apos;m gonna get this job so i can &apos;t afford to have principles ,  so screw you ,  the tickets are ours !  !   
there &apos;s the man i married !  !  
all right ,  believe me . if you win the lottery ,  it &apos;s the last you &apos;re gonna hear from us !  
fine !  don &apos;t be my friends !  i &apos;ll buy new friends !  yeah ,  and then i &apos;ll pay for their plastic surgery so they &apos;d look just like you !  
 oh !  alright ,  you know what ?  that &apos;s it !  i want my share of the tickets  !  
yeah ,  i want my tickets too  !  and i &apos;m buying the knicks !  and steffi graff ,  ah ah !  
than i want mine ,  too  !  and if i win i &apos;m gonna put it all into a very low - yield bond .  
oh ,  you guys !  we &apos;ve got to keep all the tickets together  
no ,  no !  we should divide them up  and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them !  
hey ,  if anybody gets extra tickets ,  it should be me !  this all thing was my idea !   
oh ,  yeah !  thanks for inventing the lottery !  
ok ,  that &apos;s it !  just give &apos;em to me !  i &apos;ll split them up !   
 oh !  
 ooooohhhhh !  
 hey ,  hey !  !  
 ooooohhhhh !   fine ,  i can &apos;t take it anymore !  i &apos;m putting an end to this !   
oh ,  if she jumps ,  i get her tickets .  
no ,  no !   
no !  !  
don &apos;t come any closer !  
can i come a little bit closer ,  valuable things are getting squished .  .  .  
no ,  what &apos;s more important ,  your friends or money ?  
money !   friends .  .  .  
hey monica ,  what about your extra tickets ?

phoebe ,  we lost half of them .  
so ,  what ?  monica ,  we have the winning ticket !  my psychic said i was gonna win ,  remember ?  
weird .  .  your psychic didn &apos;t mention anything about the scary pigeon .  .  .  
as a matter of fact she said that &apos;s how i am going to die .   so ,  excuse me for being a little skittish .  
 hey ,  there &apos;s two messages .  these could be from work !  
oh ,  play them !  
  &quot; hello .  th - this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise &quot;    &quot; i sh .  .  i shouldn &apos;t have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady &apos;s hand .  it - it was all my fault .  not hers .  bye .  coo .  &quot;

thank you ,  thank you very much !  
let &apos;s celebrate with some maple candy !  
no !  
can i ask you a question ?  
yeah .  
have you ever had any weird romantic dreams ?  
let me think .  oh ,  when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese ,  and on our wedding night i ate his head .  
ok ,  well this is like that .  .  . in no way .  i had a .  .  . i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey .  
wow ,  do you mean like kiss him - kiss him ?  
oh yeah !  i mean ,  that was pretty intense .  
what do you think brought than on ?  
i don &apos;t know !  i mean ,  maybe that &apos;s something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday .  
a love scene ?  with who ?  
olivia .  
olivia ?  i thought she was marrying connor !   oh right ,  real life more important .  
so do you think that my dream means anything ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  you saw him do a love scene ,  so maybe you don &apos;t have a thing for joey ,  maybe you have a thing for drake .  
ah !  well it was joey reading drake &apos;s lines in the dream .  .  .  
of course it was !  trust me ,  when it comes to psychology i know what i &apos;m talking about .  i took two psych classes in college .  
you took the same class twice .  
it was hard !   
hey !  
here ,  monica ,  look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant  uh ,  huh wait !   right ?  i mean ,  this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man .  
oh .  .  . phoebe ?  maybe i wasn &apos;t clear before .  i really love listening to your music here ,  but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place .  
right ,  yeah ,  ok ,  i &apos;ll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault .  
phoebe ,  it &apos;s not what you wear .  it &apos;s sort of your songs .  .  .  i just don &apos;t think you should play at the restaurant anymore .  
oh ,  ok .  fine ,  i &apos;ll just ,  i &apos;ll take the hat back  .   
hey ,  so you guys ,  the funniest thing happened ,  at work .  .  .  
my songs aren &apos;t good enough for your restaurant ?  
ok ,  we &apos;re still on that .  
i didn &apos;t say your songs were not good enough .  
then what &apos;s wrong with them ?  would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food ?  
tiny portions ?  
yeah well ,   &quot; excuse me ,  i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer ,  but  i can &apos;t see it ,  i can &apos;t see it &quot;  !  
phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about quantity .  
well .  .  . it &apos;s not about quality .  
oh really ,  you want to talk about quality ?  have you heard of a key ?  it &apos;s what some people sing in .  
well at least all my songs don &apos;t taste like garlic .  yeah ,  there are other ingredients monica .  
ok ,  so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .  you know ,  when i &apos;m in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs ,  i &apos;m wearing ear plugs .  
ear plugs ,  or cloves of garlic ?  
you know what ?  i take back what i said before .  you keep playing at the restaurant ,  because with your music driving people inside ,  my bar sales are going up like crazy .  
here &apos;s your copy of the bill ,  we hope you enjoyed your stay .  
oh we did ,  and you still have all your lamps .   
oh ,  i didn &apos;t factor in the room tax .  
oh dude ,  don &apos;t worry about it ,  i found an unattended maid &apos;s car .  we &apos;re way ahead of the game .   
oh my god .  
what ?  
there &apos;s something new in the bowl .  
look ,  we have enough ,  just walk away .  
no ,  but i want .  .  . i want the pinecones !  
there &apos;s a forest right outside .  
it &apos;s not the same .  
ok ,  go quick !   
 thank you for a delightful stay .   
 food here at  &apos;javu &apos; .  . will kill you .  . the food here at  &apos;javu &apos;  .  .  . will kill you .  .   
thank god ,  it &apos;s just you !  i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall .  
you &apos;d better get back in that kitchen monica ,  the garlic is not gonna overuse itself .  
ok ,  you have to stop playing now .  
why ?  the only person my playing is bothering is you !  
oh yeah ?  ok ,  let &apos;s settle this ,  come on !  
 get your garlic - peelers off me !  
by a show of hands ,  how many of you were bothered by this woman &apos;s singing outside ?   
ok ,  ok ,  how many of you enjoyed the music outside ?   ha !  
alright ,  let me ask you this question the music was fine ,  but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ?   .  
ok ,  well ,  who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky ?  
ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone ?   
ok ,  well ,  alright ,  who thinks the food is fine ,  the music was fine ,  but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking ?   .  
excuse us !   alright here &apos;s a question so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now ?   
oh .  .  . who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend &apos;s cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great !   
i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  
i &apos;m sorry too .  .  .   
ooohh .  .  .  hey !  wanna stick around and i &apos;ll whip you up some dinner ?  
yeah !  as long as it &apos;s free !  food here is ridiculously over - p .  .  .   
hey !  
hey !  
joey ,  do you have peanut butter on the back of your head ?  
 oh man !  i thought i got it all !  
 how .  .  . how .  .  .  ?  
i was making a peanut butter smoothy ,  right ?  
uh - huh 
and i couldn &apos;t find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender .  .  . and i thought .  .  . well .  .  .  how important can that be ,  right .  .  .  ?  turns out very !  
 wow .  .  . definitely just drake .  .  .  
what ?  
what .  .  . how is it going with drake ?  
oh .  .  . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going very well .  .  .  
what .  .  . that scene i saw was so good !  
well ,  i &apos;m feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow .  .  .  
joey ,  is this that thing that you do when you say you &apos;re bad so i &apos;ll give you a compliment ?  
a little .  yeah no ,  i really am worried ,  you know ,  i mean i have to make it convincing that i &apos;m in love with olivia .  
so ?  
so .  .  . i &apos;ve never played that !  
ooh !  honey ,  it can &apos;t be that hard ,  i mean ,  you &apos;ve been in love before ?  
uh .  .  . well .  .  . just once .  .  . with you .  .  .  
ok .  .  . this could be a little awkward .  .  . i &apos;m just going to blow past it .  .  .  well can &apos;t you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance ?  
 what the hell are you talking about ?  ?  
 alright ,  alright look ,  just uh .  .  .  just try to remember how you felt when you were in love ,  and think about that when you &apos;re playing the scene .  
 oh !  ok ,  yeah ,  i think i can do that .  yeah ok ,  there &apos;s this party scene coming up .  .  and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her ,  but he can &apos;t .  .  .  and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you ,  but you didn &apos;t know so i would just pretend everything was cool ,  but really ,  it was killing me .  
 joey ,  you never .  . you never talked about that before .  .  .  
well .  .  hey ,  you know what else i could use ?  there &apos;s a scene where drake sneaks into olivia &apos;s bedroom ,  and she doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s there  -  which never happened with us !  and he knows he shouldn &apos;t be there ,  but he just wants to look at her .  .  .  you know ?   and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make - up ,  when i would think to myself ,  my god ,  she .  .  . is .  .  .  beautiful .  .  .   and it hurts so much ,  cuz i knew i could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you .   
i got you something from vermont !

nothing major ,  it &apos;s just that ,  you know ,  they &apos;re not really good enough for you ,  and you deserve the best .  
joey ,  you &apos;re so sweet .  
that &apos;s true .  but you know what ,  it doesn &apos;t matter because i already know who you &apos;re gonna go home with tonight .

well you should be .  you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater .  
you really liked it ?  
oh yeah !  i mean at first i hated it ,  but why wouldn &apos;t i ,  because as a man i &apos;ve been trained  not to listen !   
oh really !  
oh yeah ,  i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman !  tell me ,  tell me about your first period !  
no !  
did somebody sign your bra ?  
hey ross !  so listen ,  about you and the dinosaur girl ,  are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off ?  what is that ,  come on ,  a piece of paper ?  
it &apos;s actually a 1 , 000 , 000$ prize .  
go charlie !  but my point is ,  ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them .  maybe she &apos;s looking to ,  you know ,  slum it with some average joe phd .  
yeah ,  maybe .  i do have my whole career in front of me .  i mean ,  i can still win a nobel prize .  although the last two papers i &apos;ve written were widely discredited .  
you &apos;re so much more than just brains !  you &apos;re sweet ,  and kind ,  and funny .  .  .  
and sexy .  
ok well give her a chance to see all of that !  
yeah ,  you &apos;re right ,  thanks pheebs ,  i &apos;m gonna go find her .  
good for you !  and hey ,  i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch !  
stop going through my stuff  !   
 hey !  
hey !  
i just wanted to let you know i &apos;ve changed my mind do it ,  i &apos;m gonna kiss joey .  
no ,  you can &apos;t !  friends hooking up is a bad idea .  
please ,  what about you and chandler ?  
that &apos;s different !  i was drunk and stupid !  
well hello  !  
what about all the guys that you &apos;ve got the phone numbers from ?  why don &apos;t you just kiss one of them ?  
i could ,  i could but i don &apos;t want to !  i want to kiss joey !  
alright  .  i think it &apos;s a big mistake but it &apos;s your decision .  
 i &apos;m gonna do it .  
and i can &apos;t stop you .  
no .   
 hey rach ,  have you seen charlie anywhere ?   
hey ,  thank you so much for these tickets ,  chandler .  
oh well ,  this was a really important experience for me ,  and i wanted to share it with you .  
oh ,  you &apos;re so wonderful .  
it &apos;s so weird ,  how did joey end up kissing charlie last night ?  i thought you &apos;d end up kissing charlie .  
hey ,  i thought i &apos;d end up kissing charlie too ok ?  but surprise !  
i missed most of the party  charlie &apos;s a girl ,  right ?  
yes ,  she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss .  
i don &apos;t know why joey had to kiss her !  i mean ,  of all the girls at the party ,  god !  
why do you care so much ?  
yes rachel ,  why do you care so much ?  
 be - cause ross is the father of my child !  you know .  .  .  and i .  .  .  want him to hook up with lots of women !   i just .  .  .  all i &apos;m saying is .  .  .  i don &apos;t think that joey and charlie have anything in common .  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know ,  they seem to have a shared interest in each other &apos;s tonsils .  .  .  
wow ,  joey and a professor !  can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey &apos;s raw sexual magnetism .  .  .  oh ,  those nerds will get laaaaaid !  
all right ,  so .  .  .  ross ,  you &apos;re ok with all this ?  i mean .  .  .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s no big deal .  i mean ,  i just met her and i &apos;m fine with it .  .  .   
oh ,  god .  i forgot how hot she was !  
hi !  
oh ,  you know what ?  i &apos;ll come with you !  
ok .   
 so ,  a professor ,  uh ?  
 i feel like i owe you an explanation .  i don &apos;t ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties .  i &apos;m .  .  .  well ,  i &apos;m kind of embarrassed .  i really hope you don &apos;t think less of me .  
you know ,  actually i &apos;m a little surprised to myself .  i mean ,  joey is so different from the guys i usually date .  i mean ,  they &apos;re all professors ,  and intellectuals ,  and paleontologists mostly ,  you know ,  very cerebral .  .  .  
yeah ,  i know the type .  
 hey !  
hey !  
hey you guys !  look what i just got .   
oh ,  oh !  wow ,  i love those !  where did you get them ?  
i bought them off ebay !  they used to belong to the late shania twain .  
 phoebe ,  shania twain is still alive !  
oh .  .  .  then i overpaid .   
hey ,  what &apos;s this ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s a gift certificate to this new spa in soho .  
oh ,  you can &apos;t show phoebe this !  she hates those corporate massage chains .  
ah ,  why ,  now i can &apos;t get a massage ?  there are so many things that she disapproves of !  i can &apos;t eat veal ,  i can &apos;t wear fur ,  i can &apos;t go hunting .  .  .  
do you wanna go hunting ?  
well ,  i would like to have the option !  !  
 what &apos;s up ?   hey ,  rachel !  !  
oh !  
no ,  you can &apos;t go there !  you know how i feel about these  &quot; big massage places &quot;  !  they &apos;re putting people like me out of business !  
and she wants to go hunting ,  too !  !  
phoebe ,  come on ,  i don &apos;t wanna waste it !  it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks !  
ok ,  this is not about the money ,  ok ?  it &apos;s about .  .  .  it &apos;s about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us .  .  .  the hollow shells .  
i don &apos;t care about any of that !  !  
well ,  do you care about friendship ?  
oh !  
i feel really strongly about this ,  rachel .  please ,  don &apos;t use this gift certificate .  i &apos;m asking you as a friend .  
oh ,  not as a friend ,  phoebe !  !  fine ,  i won &apos;t use it !  
promise ?  
i promise .  
thank you .   
 hey honey !  i missed you today !

oh ,  well .  .  .  maybe we could .  .  .   
ok ,  trying to turn me on by making a mess ?  know your audience !  besides ,  tomorrow we &apos;re doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank .  
we really need to take those tests ?  
honey ,  we &apos;ve been trying to have a baby for over a year .  i think it &apos;s a good idea to find out if everything &apos;s ok .  just a few routine tests .  
but i don &apos;t wanna do it in a cup !  
what is the big deal ?  
it &apos;s weird !  in a doctor &apos;s office ?  
it &apos;s not ok to do it in a doctor &apos;s office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell ?  
 i cannot believe ross told you that !   and in my defense ,  it was a wendy &apos;s !  
look ,  i don &apos;t wanna do this test either ,  but i really do think it &apos;s a good idea !  
yeah ,  ok .  i &apos;m sure that doctor &apos;s office can &apos;t be worst than on a class trip to the hershey &apos;s factory !  
 oh !  
 who says that wine has to cost more than milk !   
hi !  
i &apos;m good !

 uhm .  .  .  stockholm .  
 note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas .  monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself .  
now ,  do you have any idea what you just said ?  
(shaking his head as if to say says the words ,  my brain is thinking monster trucks !  
ok now ,  remember ,  when you get to the museum ,  monet is not spelt m - o - n - a - y .  i just .  .  .  i wrote that out phonetically for you .  
phonetically ?   
yeah ,  yeah that means .  .  .  you know ?  we just .  .  .  we don &apos;t have time for this .  
ok .  
ok ,  but you know what ?  i gotta say ,  i &apos;m really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly !  
ah !  i &apos;m an actor !  i can memorize anything !  last week on  &quot; days &quot;  i had to say  &quot; frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy &quot;  .  
wow .  what does that mean ?  
no idea !  but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means  &quot; you &apos;re gonna get eaten by a bear &quot;  .  
ok !  so let &apos;s move on to the renaissance ?  
ok ,  caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure .  touch it ,  it &apos;s really bumpy !   .  
nah ah !  nah ah !   no no no !  no ad - libbing and dude ,  you can &apos;t touch the paintings .  
come on !  you .  .  .   
oh !  sid is still in his room .  i don &apos;t allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him .  so did you do it ?  did you make your deposit ?  
that &apos;s not the hard part honey !  the hard part is what comes next ,  i mean aren &apos;t you worried about the results ?  
oh !  well ,  you know what ?  it probably is .  
oh ,  chandler ,  look .  you and monica are meant to have children .  i am sure it &apos;s gonna be just fine .  
what ,  you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell ,  but you can &apos;t do it at a doctor &apos;s office ?  
  &quot; ipan stripan ,  glupi glabi !   &quot;  and that is the swedish national anthem !  thank you for asking !   
wow ,  ikea .  .  .  what a rich culture .  uhm ,  you know what ?  i have a friend who is a masseuse .  
oh ,  ja !  ja !  
yah !  she &apos;s .  .  .  uhm .  .  .  not very good though .  .  .   
uhu ,  uhu .  .  .  and why do you think that is ?  
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  maybe it &apos;s because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar .  .  .  
or .  .  .  maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you &apos;re such a high maintenance tight ass !  
 phoebe !  !  
you know it &apos;s me ?  
for like a half an hour !  man ,  you can lie about sweden !  
how can you come here ?  
how could you not tell me you worked here ?  
i don &apos;t have to tell you everything !  
yes you do ,  if you &apos;re going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage !  
tips not included .  
oh !  phoebe ,  why did you lie to me about working here ?  
because i was ashamed ok ?  i sold out for the cash !  and then they give me benefits like medical ,  and dental ,  and a 401k .  but you know .  .  .  you pay a price .  now i &apos;m this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh !  paying taxes !  
phoebe ,  honey ,  if you hate it so much ,  you should walk out there right now and quit !  be true to what you believe in !  honey ,  you have principles and i so admire that !  i don &apos;t have any !  
you know what ?  you are right .  i am gonna quit .  it &apos;s time i took my life back !  
good for you pheebs !  
ok .  
haha !  got ya !  die ,  die ,  die !   
hi !  
the museum was amazing !  
not so much ,  no .  he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say ,  and some of it didn &apos;t even make any sense .  
well ,  for one ,  he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around .  
no ,  we went to the left .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s fun  .  
actually ,  you know ,  joey is your friend ,  and you don &apos;t really know me that well; it would be weird .  
well .  .  .  i &apos;m just thinking that maybe he &apos;s not the right guy to be with right now ,  maybe i should be with someone .  .  .  i have more in common with .  you know what i mean ?  
yeah ,  i guess that &apos;s true .  
he is very sweet .  plus he &apos;s hot !  
that was going to be my next argument .

it means that my guys won &apos;t get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do .   it means .  .  .  
chandler ?  
 it means that we can keep trying ,  but there &apos;s a good chance this may never happen for us .  
 oh my god !  
i &apos;m sorry .  
i &apos;m sorry too .   
well ,  we &apos;re gonna .  .  .  we &apos;re gonna figure this out .

from .  .  .  cosmo ?  ?  
 so ,  i have to go shopping today ,  which is my least favourite thing ,  i &apos;m soo bad at picking out clothes !  
so you need someone who knows fashion ,  to tell you what looks good .  
 not me ,  not me ,  not me ,  not me ,  not me !  
oh hey rach !  
yeah .  .  .  
maybe you could take charlie shopping .  
i &apos;m sure you have better things to do .  
if you have the time ,  i &apos;d really appreciate the help .  
ok ,  uh - uh .  .  .  let &apos;s - let &apos;s shop !  !  
 ok ,  you &apos;re gonna come back with some very classy clothes .  .  .   .  .  .  and some slutty lingerie ,  slutty !  
 ok ,  great !  all right ,  bye !   pain in the ass !  !   that &apos;s off ,  right ?  
what &apos;s the matter ,  pheebs ?  
oh .  .  .  mike &apos;s sister just invited me to a party tonight ,  he &apos;s gonna be there .  and she was like  &quot; oh ,  don &apos;t worry !  i asked him .  he &apos;s totally ok with seeing you !  &quot;  .  so now i have to go so he &apos;ll think that i &apos;m totally ok with seeing him !  
which you &apos;re not ,  because you &apos;ve totally hung up on him !  
exactly !  
and you &apos;re gonna want him to eat his heart out so you &apos;re gonna have to look fabulous !  
 i didn &apos;t even think about that !   aaargh ,  sexual politics !  !  
hey pheebs ,  i &apos;m - i &apos;m taking charlie shopping ,  why don &apos;t you come and i &apos;ll help you find something .  
ok ,  that &apos;ll be great !  
oh ,  ain &apos;t that nice ?  the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together .  
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re gonna do !  
why would you ruin it ,  who was that hurtin &apos; ?  
 wow !  fortunately she has a very pretty face !  
oh ,  i so can &apos;t believe this !  my uterus is an inhospitable environment ?  i was trying so hard to be a good hostess !  
oh ,  i can &apos;t believe my sperm have low motility because ,  let me tell you ,  when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places !  !  
hi .  
hi .  
ok .  
oh ,  damn it !   
don &apos;t worry ,  after a while he &apos;ll tune it out .  
 ok .  
oh ,  yeah !  let &apos;s do it !  
 alright ,  have a good time .   
not gonna find any clothes in there !  
 hey ,  you guys !  
hi .  
umh .  .  .  kurts baley ?  
yeah ,  right !  what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  well ,  why are you laughing ?  
so you &apos;re up for keynote speaker !  who &apos;s making the decisions ?  
he &apos;s a pretty tough guy to impress .  
yeah ,  well .  .  .  i think i know how to dazzle him .  
oh .  .  .  you &apos;re not gonna do a magic trick ,  are ya ?  
tsz .  .  .  no !   .  
 hey guys !  
wait a minute ,  you guys .  oh ,  i wanna ask you something .  i - i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do ,  i &apos;d love for you guys to come and hear me .  
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues ,  work stuff and / or are sick .  
it &apos;s in barbados .  
but you come first !  
we &apos;ll see you ,  guys !   
bye .  
bye ,  see ya .   
 ok .  
all right ,  so .  how did it go at the fertility clinic ?  
not as much fun as last time .  apparently you only get porn if you &apos;re giving a sperm sample .  
so - so what did the doctor say ?  
well .  .  .  there &apos;s surrogacy ,  but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child ,  she has felt that watching a surrogate would be .  .  .  too hard for her .  
so you &apos;re ruling out surrogacy ?  
yeah .  
so ,  i don &apos;t have to learn what that means ?  
aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination ,  so .  .  .  we &apos;re talking about sperm donors .  
enough said ,  i &apos;m there for you man .  where is she ,  upstairs ?  
 ah - ha !  
how do you feel about all this ?  
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don &apos;t think there is one .  
come on ross ,  be a good guy .  step up and do it !  
 what ?   
the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are  -  are staggering .  
 i mean ,  we &apos;ve been accepting leakey &apos;s dates as a given ,  but if they &apos;re off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can  -  you can just throw most of our assumptions ,  you know ,  right in the trash .   so - so what i am saying is  -  is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge !  i mean ,  not just in palaeontology ,  but if - if you think about it ,  in evolutionary biology ,  uh ,  genetics ,  geology ,  uh ,  i mean ,  truly the mind boggles !   
oh ,  i &apos;ll take some of that .  
pheebs ,  that &apos;s for men !  
no ,  i know ,  this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i &apos;m gonna smell like another guy .   yeah .   
 so ,  you know what ,  i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them .  where do you think those would be ?  
see ,  i told you i needed someone !  oh ,  you know ,  by the way ,  as a  &quot; thank you &quot;  ,  i would really love to take you out .  
yeah !  actually joey and i are going to the movies tonight ,  wanna come ?  
you &apos;ve seen all the movies .  .  .  
yeah !  i &apos;m a big fan !  of the movies ,  you know .  motion pictures .  the talkies !  
 hey rach ,  will you come with me to a dressing room ?  
sure !  
wha ,  you know ,  maybe we can do something else !  
you know that depends on what it is !  i &apos;ve done a lot of stuff .   
so what were you doing out there ,  do you not like charlie ?  
she &apos;s ok ,  i just don &apos;t get a really good vibe from her !  
why ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  you know ,  just the way she waltzed in here all smart ,  and tall !  you know ,  and just swept joey off his feet .  .  .  i mean ,  nobody else has a chance !  
who else ?  
anybody !  you ,  me ,  you know ,  monica &apos;s mom .  .  .  
you like joey ?  
shhhhh !  phoebe !  all right ,  look .  i have a little thing for him .  
 oh my god !  
it &apos;s just physical and i have it totally under control !  ok ?  it &apos;s just ,  when i see them together ,  sometimes i just get a little jealous !  
uh ,  wow !  isn &apos;t it ironic that he liked you and now you like him ?  
 oh ,  i get it !  
oh well ,  as long as it is under control ,  you know ,  you can &apos;t do anything about it ,  he &apos;s already dating her ,  and she is a nice person ,  that wouldn &apos;t be right .  
i know ,  i know ,  so it is just not a big deal .  
yeah .  
so can we keep this between us ?  
sure !  
ok ,  great ,  because i gotta get out of here ,  the smell of beets is killing me !  
oh .   
hi honey !  
hey !  look i brought a friend for dinner ,  this is zack ,  from work !  
 you too .  
you guys haven &apos;t actually met before ,  but ,  boy !  you &apos;re both polite !   go to have a seat zack ,  and i &apos;ll get you a beer .  
thanks .  
 so ,  zack &apos;s pretty nice ,  uh ?  
yeah ,  i guess .  
so ,  how would you like to have a baby that &apos;s half yours and half his !  
 excuse me ?  
well ,  we &apos;re talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy !  i mean ,  look ,  he &apos;s intelligent ,  he &apos;s healthy ,  he &apos;s athletic ,  i mean ,  he is  &quot; spermtastic &quot;  !  
chandler ,  this is crazy !  what did you even say to him !   &quot; come up ,  meet my wife !  give us your sperm &quot;  !  
no ,  i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him !  i mean ,  if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy ,  get to check him out .  
chandler !  
i &apos;m telling you ,  he &apos;s great !  i mean ,  even if my sperm worked fine ,  i &apos;d think he &apos;d be the way to go !  
i &apos;m not going to be a part of this !  you can &apos;t just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor !  
ok !  
uh !  
thanks !  do you have a coaster ?  i don &apos;t wanna make a ring .   
oh ,  god ,  do you think she heard ?  it would be so bad if she heard !  
well ,  maybe she didn &apos;t hear !  ok i &apos;m gonna go into that dressing room ,  you stay in here and i &apos;ll talk and see if you can hear me .  
ok ,  great !   
oh ,  thank god i can &apos;t hear a word that you &apos;re saying !  
 i didn &apos;t say anything yet !  
 well ,  get back in there and talk !  
 i &apos;m rachel .  it &apos;s so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends .  
 what !  ?  
 well ,  some things are just hard to say to your face .  
ok well ,  i heard that !  which means that she heard it too !  
ooh !  we have a problem .  
just be honest with her .  
and it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone .  .  .  
hello ?  
joey !  hey ,  i need to talk to charlie .  is she there ?  
no .  no .  .  .  eh .  .  .  she went shopping with rachel .  why ?  what &apos;s up ?  
i &apos;m meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker .  .  .  
oh !  how &apos;s it going ?  
it could be better !  he ,  uhm .  .  .  he fell asleep !  
what !  ?  but i already bought my ticket to bermuda !  
barbados .  
fine ,  i &apos;ll rent a car and drive .  .  .  !  ross ,  you have to get that job !  
what am i supposed to do ?  he &apos;s out cold !  in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder .  
well ,  just wake him up !  
i can &apos;t !  if he realizes that i &apos;m the one that put him to sleep ,  i won &apos;t get the job !  
oh !  i &apos;m gonna go wash up first .   thanks !  
so what do you think ?  i want that guys genes for my kid !  those eyes ,  those cheeckbones !  
ok ,  there &apos;s enthusiastic and there &apos;s just plain gay !  !  
you don &apos;t like him .  
i think he is fine !  it &apos;s just that we don &apos;t know anything real about him .  .  .  we should get more information .  
you guys have such a great place here .  
uhm .  .  .  no .  although i did have an uncle who voted for dukakis .  
 okaaay .  .  .  so eh .  .  .  so tell me ,  how did you guys meet .  
 no .  .  .  
you guys don &apos;t have people for dinner a lot ,  huh ?  
ok .  i heard a joke today .  it &apos;s pretty funny .  .  .  
ravioli &apos;s delicious !  
no i didn &apos;t .  
yess !  !   
alright !  let &apos;s just do it .  let &apos;s just go over there and see if she heard .  
good plan .  
ok .   wha .  .  .  ?  where ?  where are you going ?  
oh !  i &apos;m sorry rachel ,  i don &apos;t have time for your childish games ,  ok ?  i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at  &quot; who &apos;s more over who &quot;  !   
oh !  trying on clothes .  
 rachel .  .  .  i heard you guys whispering .  
no !  there &apos;s nothing to explain .  i heard you .  phoebe likes joey .  
it &apos;s just that .  .  .  i don &apos;t understand it .  .  .  i mean ,  phoebe likes joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy .  .  .  ?  
wow !  
you know ,  by the way .  i heard you tell her not to do anything .  thanks for sticking up for me .  you are such a nice person .  
 i try .  .  .  
 
 oh my god !  you really want me to be the keynote speaker ?  thank you !   
 
 wow !  you look .  .  .   .  .  .  stop - eating hot !  which is like the highest level of hotness !  
are you sure ?  because i &apos;m really dreading going to this party .  
then don &apos;t go !  
mike knows i &apos;m coming ,  and if i don &apos;t show up he &apos;ll think it &apos;s because of him !  and i don &apos;t want to lose face !  that &apos;s a very serious thing in my culture .  
alright ,  then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike .  and afterward you come to my place and i &apos;ll get you good and drunk !  
phoebe !  hi !  
wow ,  you look unbelievable .  
well ,  i &apos;m back from minsk .  .  .  permanently .  
well ,  remember how i was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles ?  
well ,  after eight years of research i discovered that it can &apos;t be done .  
good ,  good ,  life is good .  .  .  
ah well ,  i - i &apos;m seeing someone .  
she &apos;s also a scientist ,  so she &apos;s very smart and pretty and .  .  .  well ,  it &apos;s actually because of you ,  really ,  that we &apos;re together ,  i mean ,  i saw what you had with that mike guy ,  and i just said  &quot; boy ,  i want that &quot;  .  
you &apos;re kidding me .  because i &apos;m not seeing anybody ,  i &apos;ve just totally made that up .  
yeah ,  i don &apos;t know why ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i guess i just didn &apos;t want to lose face .  
yeah ,  i know .  well .  .  .  this is probably a stupid question ,  seeing that you look like that ,  but do you have some place that you need to be right now ?  
do you wanna get a drink ?  
great .  
do you smell beets ?  
hey ,  there &apos;s phoebe !  is that mike she &apos;s with ?  
there &apos;s a third guy ?  
i &apos;m gonna take off now .  you &apos;re gonna let me go home ,  aren &apos;t you ?  
no ,  no ,  i should get home ,  i &apos;m kinda tired .  
no it &apos;s just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died .  i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .  
ok .   
i think we &apos;ve found our sperm !  
does seem pretty perfect .  
yeah ,  you think so ,  well ?  should i ask him ?  
 no .  
why not ,  just because his great - grandmother was obese ,  our kids are gonna get that from you anyway !  
no ,  that &apos;s not it .  it &apos;s just that when we were asking him all those questions before ,  i just .  .  .  i just realized i don &apos;t care if he &apos;s the most perfect guy in the world .  .  .  he &apos;s not you .  
yeah ,  he &apos;s better !  
no ,  he &apos;s not .  and if i can &apos;t get pregnant with you ,  then i don &apos;t want to get pregnant by .  .  .  him or anyone else .  
really ?  are you sure ?  
yeah ,  i &apos;m sure .  
 thank god ,  because i don &apos;t wanna do this either .  you know ,  i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do .  you know ,  i &apos;m the husband ,  i &apos;m supposed to .  .  .  bring the sperm .  
that is so sweet .  i love you .   
so you know this leaves us with .  .  .  
adoption .  
how do you feel about that ?  
i think i feel ok about it .  actually i think i feel really good about it .  
me too .  i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you .  and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way .  
so this is it ,  we &apos;re really gonna adopt ?  
 yeah .  
 oh my god ,  we &apos;re gonna be parents !  
we are gonna be great parents .  
and it could be soon .  i mean ,  think about it 
wait ,  if we &apos;re lucky ,  and we &apos;re really really really quiet ,  we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking !   
 hey chandler .  
no you didn &apos;t .  
no you did .  
oh ,  thank you .   
 hey !  i &apos;m all packed and ready to go !  
oh ,  that &apos;s right !   daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today .  we &apos;re going to a conference in barbados ,  right ?  
mmh - mmh .  
 can you say barbados ?  
barbados !  
ok ,  i gotta say .  i mean ,  it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech !  uh !  and i &apos;ve a surprise ,  uh .  .  .  i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference !  that &apos;s right !   this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars .  
do you have anything that would .  .  .  get us out of them ?  
yeah ross ,  i mean .  .  .  we &apos;re excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we &apos;re gonna wanna do ,  you know ,   &quot; island &apos;s stuff &quot;  .  
i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures .  
oh ,  right ,  because he &apos;s a scientist !  
no ,  no ,  because ,  you know ,  he &apos;s been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight ,  he &apos;ll die .  
ok ,  we gotta go ,  yeah ?  so ,  we &apos;ll see you guys tomorrow .  
all right ,  let &apos;s do it !  5 hour flight with charlie ,  have a couple of drinks ,  get under that blanket and do what comes naturally .  
wow !  this place is beautiful !  
 look at all these paleontologists !  !  
oh my god ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here !  
doctor geller ,  i &apos;m such a huge fan !  
i &apos;ve been following your career for years ,  i - i can &apos;t wait for your keynote speech .  
i would love your autograph .   
sarah .  
thank you so much !  
 are you a paleontologist ?  
no ,  god ,  no !  no !  no no ,  i &apos;m an actor .  you &apos;d probably recognize me from a little show called  &quot; the days of our lives &quot;  .  
dude ,  it &apos;s just  &quot; days of our lives &quot;  .  .  .  there &apos;s no the .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i don &apos;t own a tv .  
oh ,  certainly .  that &apos;s a combination of bernoulli &apos;s principle and newton &apos;s third law of motion .  
 see ?  
yeah ,  that &apos;s the same as  &quot; it has something to do with wind &quot;  .  
alright ,  i &apos;m gonna go pick up a few things for the trip .  
oh ,  i should go ,  too .  oh ,  now .  .  .  tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there .   
mike is your ex .  .  .  uh .  .  .  boyfriend !  
it &apos;s ok .  ho - honest mistake .  
really ,  it doesn &apos;t mean anything .  i mean ,  you know ,  monica refers to chandler as richard all the time !  
 she does ?  
 let &apos;s get you out of here !  !    
at least you took me down with you !  
i &apos;m sooo sorry !  !  i just .  .  .  i keep thinking about mike !  i &apos;m crazy about david ,  and we &apos;re having so much fun together .  why - why do i miss mike ?  that &apos;s - that &apos;s gonna go away ,  right ?  
i guess ,  in time .  
yeah .  
i mean ,  my feelings for richard are certainly gone .  
 well ,  phoebe &apos;s still pretty hung up on that mike ,  uh ?  
still you know ,  a girl calls you by your ex - boyfriend &apos;s name ,  that - that &apos;s not a good thing ,  right ?  
sorry ,  i just .  .  .  i wish there was something i could do ,  you know ?  well ,  you know phoebe .  .  .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  uh .  .  .  i just wish i could make her forget about mike already ,  you know .  .  .  why did phoebe and mike break up ?  
that &apos;s great !  that &apos;s great !  i - i &apos;ll propose to her !  
well ,  i was probably going to do it at some point .  
why not ?  it &apos;s brilliant !   goodbye mike ,  we &apos;ll see you at the wedding ,  fella !   well ,  we probably won &apos;t invite you to the wedding .  .  .   thank you ,  chandler .  sincerely .  
 how do you think i should propose ?  
david ,  i &apos;m pretending to read here !  !  
 
yeah !  how you doin &apos; ?  yeah alright !   
 i didn &apos;t mean a thong .  .  .  i meant thongs .  .  .  
you really should have been more clear about that !   
hey !  
hey !  
 you &apos;re never going to guess who i just saw downstairs !  
oh !  ah !  eh .  .  .  britney spears !  ?  
oh my god !  did you talk to him ?  
yeah .  .  .  what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz ?  
you could say 
yeah !  
oh i can &apos;t .  .  .  i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech .  
but maybe we can have dinner later ?  on the balcony ?  will be romantic .  
i will if you will .  
oh .  .  .  you got yourself a very weird deal !  
so you &apos;ll be ok ?  
yeah ,  yeah .  i &apos;ve got tons of stuff i could do .  i &apos;m gonna hit the beach ,  go swimming .  .  .  
uh ,  joe ,  have you looked outside ?  
no ,  why ?   
there &apos;s an indoor pool ,  you can swim there !   
wow !  that mike thing was interesting !  i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen with phoebe and david .  
 i do !  want a hint ?  huh ?   &quot; i do &quot;    &quot; i do &quot;  .  
ok ,  i &apos;m sensing that this is some kind of word play ,  because you are pink with barely controlled glee .  
david is going to propose to phoebe .  
what ?   why ?  
be - cause ,  we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .  
chandler ,  we have talked about this .  you are not supposed to give people advice !  now couldn &apos;t you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?  
i did !  a penis one !  look ,  just so i know ,  what was so wrong about what i said ?  
they &apos;ve only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike !  she &apos;ll say  &quot; no &quot;  ,  david &apos;s heart will be broken ,  it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .  
man ,  that &apos;s some bad advice !  
 
oh !  hey !  thank god you guys are here !  
hey !  hey what &apos;s going on ?  
everything is upside down here !  it rains all day long ,  nobody watches tv and ross is famous !   
alright ,  i don &apos;t wanna alarm anybody ,  but monica &apos;s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed !   
ok !  when i go places with high humidity ,  it gets a little extra body ,  ok ?  !  
that &apos;s why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross !  
come on ,  i &apos;ll show you guys where to check in  
 oh ,  honey ,  can you make sure we get a king size bed !  
 oh !  david ,  get one for us too !  oh ,  oh ,  and see if they have a heart - shaped one !  and with mirrors on the ceiling !  
 and make sure our room isn &apos;t next to theirs  .  
ooh !  you guys are so lucky you are here with people ,  you known it &apos;s such a romantic place .  that &apos;s all ,  i just wish i could  share that with a guy .  
not joey .  
not joey ,  no ,  i was just lusting after chandler .  
so ,  ehm .  .  .  i &apos;m proposing to pheobe tonight .   
yeah ,  well ,  being a failed scientist doesn &apos;t pay quite as well as you might think .  that &apos;s uhm .  .  .  one seventieth of a karat .  and the clarity is uhm .  .  .  is quite poor .  
 nice !   
monica ,  can i talk to you for a sec ?   
ok !  
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight !  
see what happens when you give people advice ?  i hope you told him not to ?  
that would be advice !  !  
ok fine .  i &apos;ll handle this .   phoebe ?  
yeah ?  
 i need to talk to you .  
are you leaving  &quot; the supremes &quot;  ?   
ok ,  my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice .  look ,  david is going to propose to you tonight .

phoebe is going to say  &quot; yes &quot;  to david .  see ,  that &apos;s what happens when you meddle in people &apos;s lives !  
phoebe is going to say  &quot; yes &quot;  ?  that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s great !  
no it &apos;s not ,  b &apos;cause she &apos;s still in love with mike !  
and there &apos;s not chance that will work ?

good night .  
night .   
 
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gonna say yes to david .  she &apos;s clearly in love with mike .  
uh ,  phoebe ,  uh ,  i have .  .  .  something i wanna say .  
oh my god ,  he &apos;s gonna do it now .  please ,  i cannot watch this ,  let &apos;s go .  
uh ,  phoebe ,  uh .  .  .   you &apos;re an amazing woman ,  and the time we spent apart was ,  was unbearable .  of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn &apos;t help !  
but well ,  now that we &apos;re together again ,  i don &apos;t ever want to be apart .  so ,  to that end .  .  .   
it &apos;s david ,  actually !  
hi david .  chandler .  monica .  .  .   oh !  
hi phoebe .  
alright ,  but after this i want to see you outside .  if the rain stops .  
i have a ring .  
phoebe ,  will you marry me ?  
uhm .  .  .  ha ha !  
ok ,  i &apos;m gonna take off .  
just so i know ,  if i had asked first .  .  .  
is it ok if i hug you now ?  
yes !   
oh ,  ain &apos;t this nice ?  it &apos;s so quiet ,  i could just lie here all day .  
i know   
 open your drapes !  open your drapes !  
i &apos;m so glad we &apos;ve got adjoining rooms !   
the sun is out !  
hey !  remember when i had corneas ?  
ok listen ,  you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs ,  and i &apos;ll get the magazines and the lotion .  
ladies ?  ross &apos;s speech is in 45 minutes .  
nooo !  
damn it !  
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating .  
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan .  .  .  so leathery and wrinkled ,  i &apos;m so jealous !  
finally ,  factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
 not to mention the cold sores .   
and that &apos;s just the herbivores .  i &apos;m not even gonna discuss the carnivores ,  their heads are already too big .  which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .   
 really ?  
what ?  
you &apos;re .  .  .  you &apos;re kidding ,  right ?  
no ,  he really said it .  
 .  .  .  and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus .  .  .   
erectus ?  
 .  .  .  in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .   thank you !   
oh ,  thanks guys !  
oh !  
 ok .  .  .  now .  .  .  now we &apos;re just holding hands !   
all right !  well ,  uh .  .  .   we &apos;re gonna hit the beach ?  
yeah !  
 it was really .  .  .  great !  
oh ,  thank you so much !  
yeah ,  and so funny !  
oh !   
oh .  .  .  i &apos;m back !

you were incredible !  
you blew them away !  
 i was not !  
oh my god !   i &apos;m your groupie !  
 i &apos;d better not found you naked in my hotel room !   
 i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again !  oh ,  it &apos;s so unfair !  !  !   
well ,  on the bright side ,  now you won &apos;t have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off .   not you guys .  you got it going on !   
they have a game room downstairs !  ping pong and stuff .  
 ping pong ?   honey ,  they have ping pong !  let &apos;s play !  
i don &apos;t think so !  
 why not ?  
because you know how competitive you get and well ,  i say it &apos;s cute ,  others disagree ,  and i &apos;m lying !  
i &apos;m not always that bad !  
oh ,  yeah ?  what happened when we played last time ?  
 i punched you .  .  .  ?  
and .  .  .  ?  
 .  .  .  phoebe .  .  .  ?

actually ,  it turned out to be a lot of fun !  
 .  .  .  is it weird that it &apos;s not with each other ?  
 i think we need to talk .  .  .  !   
c &apos;mon guys ,  it &apos;ll be fun !  
all right ,  all right .  .  .  i &apos;ll play if we don &apos;t keep score !  
but then how do we know who wins ?  
nobody wins !  
so ,  we &apos;re just four losers .  .  .  super !  
i &apos;m not playing with you .  
i &apos;ll play ya !  
 ok !  
mike ,  you don &apos;t know ,  you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing !

 monica ,  you call it .  
heads !  no ,  tails !  he - he - heads !  
tails !  
 ow ,  what are the chances !   
oh ,  no !  i don &apos;t think so !  you know ,  according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point .  
oh !  weather bitch !    
it &apos;s open !   hi ,  joe !  
 hey .  .  .  
 what ,  is everything ok ?  
uh .  .  .  charlie and i broke up .

 oh ,  that &apos;s crazy !  
no ,  it &apos;s not ,  we have nothing in common !  
 .  .  .  yeah ,  it &apos;s true .  
i mean ,  she should be with someone like .  .  .  ross !  you know what i mean ,  he uses all those big words too !  man ,  smart people are dull !  
 what ,  hey !  
 ok ,  rach !   
i feel so stupid ,  you know ?  why .  .  .  why do i keep going after the wrong girls ?  
w - what are you ,  what are you talking about ?  
oh ,  c &apos;mon ,  i mean ,  there &apos;s you ,  then there &apos;s charlie ,  and it &apos;s like .  .  .   what the hell is my problem ?  oh !   
ok .  .  .  uh .  .  .  maybe you &apos;re not always going after the wrong girl .  .  .  
 i &apos;m telling you ,  rach ,  charlie is not right for me !

what .  .  .  for how long ?  
only like a month !  
 a month ?  ?  
what the .  .  .  dial it down !   listen ,  ok ,  and maybe they &apos;re crazy thoughts ,  but sometimes i do ,  i have ,  i &apos;ve been thinking about .  .  .  you know ,  us !   ok ,  dial it up a little !  
 i just have one question !  
shoot !  
 what the hell are you doin &apos; ?  ?  ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  i &apos;m not trying to do anything ,  it &apos;s just ,  we have such a good time when we &apos;re together ,  you know .  .  .  i mean ,  aren &apos;t you just a .  .  .  little curious .  .  .   what that would be like ?  .  .  .  
uh ,  am i curious ?  i mean ,  i am as curious as .  .  .  as .  .  .  george !  !  
 who .  .  .  ?  
curious george  !  you know ,  the monkey ,  and the guy with the yellow hat !  
oh yes ,  of course ,  i remember him !  
yeah ,  he had a paper route .  
yeah ,  he did !   oh ,  see ,  this is what i &apos;m talking about !  
no ,  i know ,  yeah i know we &apos;re great but rach no .  .  .  this .  .  .  this can &apos;t happen !  
but can it .  .  .  just .  .  .  happen a little bit ?  
 no ,  no !  it can &apos;t happen at all !  
but why ,  why not ?  
because .  .  .  look ,  no one wants this to happen more than me ,  ok ?   i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no !   i couldn &apos;t do it to ross !  
but that wasn &apos;t gonna stop you before !  
i know ,  i know !  but i &apos;ve thought about it a lot since ,  and it just wouldn &apos;t be right .  .  .   i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  !  
 i &apos;m sorry ,  too !   oh god !  i shouldn &apos;t have said anything !  
no !  no - no - no - no - no - no !  hey !  hey ,  we &apos;ll be fine !  li .  .  .  hey ,  like you said 
it &apos;s not a big deal !  
no big deal !  
it &apos;s so not a big deal !  
yeah !  i &apos;ll see ya later !  yeah !  
ok !   
ok ,  i .  .  .   
do you ?  
do you ?  
do you ?  
ah yeaaaah !  
 do you really find this attractive on him ?  
 oh ,  yeah !   are you telling me you .  .  .  you &apos;re not even .  .  .  a little turned on by monica ,  right now ?   
i think this is the first time in our marriage that i &apos;ve felt like the more attractive one .  
c &apos;mon mike ,  you can beat her !  knock that dog off her head !   
oh ,  damn it !  
 game ,  point !  
you know ,  you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that .   
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done !   
okay - dokay ,  you &apos;ve each won a game and i &apos;ve lost what &apos;s felt like a year of my life .  so everybody goes home a winner .  
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .  
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil ?  
serve the ball ,  chump .  
i &apos;m just saying ,  i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city ,  well ,  that &apos;d be  just nifty !  
 oh ,  you &apos;re back .  .  .   this is my wife ,  nancy .  
ross ,  can i talk to you for a minute ?  
uh ,  well .  .  .  joey and i broke up .  
joey is a great guy ,  but we &apos;re just .  .  .  so different !  i mean ,  during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus !  
anyway i just ,  uh ,  i think it &apos;s for the best .  
 ok geller .  last day of the conference ,  you know what happens to the keynote speaker .  
yeah ,  can you guys just throw him in the pool later ?  
 ok ,  gentlemen !  please !  aren &apos;t we a little old for this ?  i mean ,  we &apos;re scientists ,  right ?  we &apos;re academics .  and most importantly i .  .  .  you - you will have to catch us first .   .  go ,  go ,  go !   
ok ,  so it &apos;s a tie again ,  41 to 41 .  
 ok ,  look !  enough is enough !  
no ,  i have just to have two more points to beat him !  
monica ,  that was also true an hour ago !  i mean ,  please ,  look at you !  your hand is blistered ,  you can barely stand ,  your hair is inexplicable !  ok ,  you &apos;ve already proven you are just as good as he is ,  now we &apos;ve missed our dinner reservations ,  so now let &apos;s just go upstairs ,  order room service ,  take a shower and shave your head !  
i can &apos;t just walk away !  i &apos;ve put in four hours !  
but .  .  .  
look !  you knew this about me when you married me !  you agreed to take me in sickness and in health .  well ,  this is my sickness !  
what about the obsessive cleaning ?  
that &apos;s just good sense !   
 aww !   
you ok ?  
so you forfeit ?  
mike wins ?  
i can &apos;t believe it !   i lost !  
no ,  you didn &apos;t .  
what ?  
because i &apos;m gonna play for ya .  
oh ,  that &apos;s ok .  i don &apos;t care which of them i beat .  
ok ,  we &apos;re taking that paddle home ,  mister .  
 honey ,  you don &apos;t have to do this .  
 yes ,  i do .  now ,  i may not understand why you have to win so badly ,  but if it &apos;s important to you then it &apos;s important to me ,  because i love you .  
but .  .  .  you suck !  
 you &apos;re welcome ,  sweetheart .   
ok !   
oh my god !  you &apos;re good !  
it &apos;s like watching porn !   
and that &apos;s .  .  .  how .  .  .  it &apos;s done !  
 oh my god .  that was so amazing !  when did you  hold on !  i almost forgot  loser !   when did you stop sucking ?  
i never sucked ,  i actually didn &apos;t want you to know how good i was !  
why ?  
i don &apos;t know .  
this is so great !  now we can enter into doubles tournaments !  
thanks !  
are they still looking for us ?  
yeah .  the bartender said that they split up into two search parties ,  the herbivores and the carnivores .   you know ,  we as a group are not the coolest .   
hum ,  so ,  i started to say you something earlier ,  hum .  .  .   there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey .  i kind of realized i .  .  .  was starting to have feelings .  .  .  for someone else .  
i think you know .  
i think i know too but i &apos;ve been really wrong about this stuff in the past ,  so .  .  .   
all right ,  all right .  
i mean ,  you just went out with my best friend ,  and i just think it &apos;d be a really really bad idea .   or - or not !    
 hey !  i &apos;m all packed and ready to go !  
oh ,  that &apos;s right !   daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today .  we &apos;re going to a conference in barbados ,  right ?  
mmh - mmh .  
 can you say barbados ?  
barbados !  
ok ,  i gotta say .  i mean ,  it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech !  uh !  and i &apos;ve a surprise ,  uh .  .  .  i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference !  that &apos;s right !   this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars .  
do you have anything that would .  .  .  get us out of them ?  
yeah ross ,  i mean .  .  .  we &apos;re excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we &apos;re gonna wanna do ,  you know ,   &quot; island &apos;s stuff &quot;  .  
i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures .  
oh ,  right ,  because he &apos;s a scientist !  
no ,  no ,  because ,  you know ,  he &apos;s been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight ,  he &apos;ll die .  
ok ,  we gotta go ,  yeah ?  so ,  we &apos;ll see you guys tomorrow .  
all right ,  let &apos;s do it !  5 hour flight with charlie ,  have a couple of drinks ,  get under that blanket and do what comes naturally .  
wow !  this place is beautiful !  
 look at all these paleontologists !  !  
oh my god ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here !  
doctor geller ,  i &apos;m such a huge fan !  
i &apos;ve been following your career for years ,  i - i can &apos;t wait for your keynote speech .  
i would love your autograph .   
sarah .  
thank you so much !  
 are you a paleontologist ?  
no ,  god ,  no !  no !  no no ,  i &apos;m an actor .  you &apos;d probably recognize me from a little show called  &quot; the days of our lives &quot;  .  
dude ,  it &apos;s just  &quot; days of our lives &quot;  .  .  .  there &apos;s no the .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i don &apos;t own a tv .  
oh ,  certainly .  that &apos;s a combination of bernoulli &apos;s principle and newton &apos;s third law of motion .  
 see ?  
yeah ,  that &apos;s the same as  &quot; it has something to do with wind &quot;  .  
alright ,  i &apos;m gonna go pick up a few things for the trip .  
oh ,  i should go ,  too .  oh ,  now .  .  .  tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there .   
mike is your ex .  .  .  uh .  .  .  boyfriend !  
it &apos;s ok .  ho - honest mistake .  
really ,  it doesn &apos;t mean anything .  i mean ,  you know ,  monica refers to chandler as richard all the time !  
 she does ?  
 let &apos;s get you out of here !  !    
at least you took me down with you !  
i &apos;m sooo sorry !  !  i just .  .  .  i keep thinking about mike !  i &apos;m crazy about david ,  and we &apos;re having so much fun together .  why - why do i miss mike ?  that &apos;s - that &apos;s gonna go away ,  right ?  
i guess ,  in time .  
yeah .  
i mean ,  my feelings for richard are certainly gone .  
 well ,  phoebe &apos;s still pretty hung up on that mike ,  uh ?  
still you know ,  a girl calls you by your ex - boyfriend &apos;s name ,  that - that &apos;s not a good thing ,  right ?  
sorry ,  i just .  .  .  i wish there was something i could do ,  you know ?  well ,  you know phoebe .  .  .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  uh .  .  .  i just wish i could make her forget about mike already ,  you know .  .  .  why did phoebe and mike break up ?  
that &apos;s great !  that &apos;s great !  i - i &apos;ll propose to her !  
well ,  i was probably going to do it at some point .  
why not ?  it &apos;s brilliant !   goodbye mike ,  we &apos;ll see you at the wedding ,  fella !   well ,  we probably won &apos;t invite you to the wedding .  .  .   thank you ,  chandler .  sincerely .  
 how do you think i should propose ?  
david ,  i &apos;m pretending to read here !  !  
 
yeah !  how you doin &apos; ?  yeah alright !   
 i didn &apos;t mean a thong .  .  .  i meant thongs .  .  .  
you really should have been more clear about that !   
hey !  
hey !  
 you &apos;re never going to guess who i just saw downstairs !  
oh !  ah !  eh .  .  .  britney spears !  ?  
oh my god !  did you talk to him ?  
yeah .  .  .  what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz ?  
you could say 
yeah !  
oh i can &apos;t .  .  .  i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech .  
but maybe we can have dinner later ?  on the balcony ?  will be romantic .  
i will if you will .  
oh .  .  .  you got yourself a very weird deal !  
so you &apos;ll be ok ?  
yeah ,  yeah .  i &apos;ve got tons of stuff i could do .  i &apos;m gonna hit the beach ,  go swimming .  .  .  
uh ,  joe ,  have you looked outside ?  
no ,  why ?   
there &apos;s an indoor pool ,  you can swim there !   
wow !  that mike thing was interesting !  i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen with phoebe and david .  
 i do !  want a hint ?  huh ?   &quot; i do &quot;    &quot; i do &quot;  .  
ok ,  i &apos;m sensing that this is some kind of word play ,  because you are pink with barely controlled glee .  
david is going to propose to phoebe .  
what ?   why ?  
be - cause ,  we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .  
chandler ,  we have talked about this .  you are not supposed to give people advice !  now couldn &apos;t you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?  
i did !  a penis one !  look ,  just so i know ,  what was so wrong about what i said ?  
they &apos;ve only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike !  she &apos;ll say  &quot; no &quot;  ,  david &apos;s heart will be broken ,  it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .  
man ,  that &apos;s some bad advice !  
 
oh !  hey !  thank god you guys are here !  
hey !  hey what &apos;s going on ?  
everything is upside down here !  it rains all day long ,  nobody watches tv and ross is famous !   
alright ,  i don &apos;t wanna alarm anybody ,  but monica &apos;s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed !   
ok !  when i go places with high humidity ,  it gets a little extra body ,  ok ?  !  
that &apos;s why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross !  
come on ,  i &apos;ll show you guys where to check in  
 oh ,  honey ,  can you make sure we get a king size bed !  
 oh !  david ,  get one for us too !  oh ,  oh ,  and see if they have a heart - shaped one !  and with mirrors on the ceiling !  
 and make sure our room isn &apos;t next to theirs  .  
ooh !  you guys are so lucky you are here with people ,  you known it &apos;s such a romantic place .  that &apos;s all ,  i just wish i could  share that with a guy .  
not joey .  
not joey ,  no ,  i was just lusting after chandler .  
so ,  ehm .  .  .  i &apos;m proposing to pheobe tonight .   
yeah ,  well ,  being a failed scientist doesn &apos;t pay quite as well as you might think .  that &apos;s uhm .  .  .  one seventieth of a karat .  and the clarity is uhm .  .  .  is quite poor .  
 nice !   
monica ,  can i talk to you for a sec ?   
ok !  
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight !  
see what happens when you give people advice ?  i hope you told him not to ?  
that would be advice !  !  
ok fine .  i &apos;ll handle this .   phoebe ?  
yeah ?  
 i need to talk to you .  
are you leaving  &quot; the supremes &quot;  ?

wow ?  really ?  that &apos;s fantastic !  
what are you serious ?  you wanna marry him ?  wha .  .  .  what about mike ?  
oh ,  ok ,  you want me to marry mike ?  alright ,  well ,  let &apos;s just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle .  i can just see it 
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ?  
it &apos;s great .  you &apos;re gonna be the hit of the conference .  
oh and you know what ,  it will be even better tomorrow ,  because i won &apos;t be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet .   .  
hey guys !  
the chocolates aren &apos;t here yet .  
ross just read me his speech .  it &apos;s fantastic !  
oh ,  is it on the computer ,  cuz i &apos;d love to give it a read .  .  .  ?

your computer ,  i don &apos;t know wha .  .  .  everything &apos;s gone !

someone i don &apos;t know sent me an e - mail and i opened it .  
why ,  why would you open it ?  
well ,  it didn &apos;t say  &quot; this is a virus &quot;  !  !

i just feel awful .  
yeah ,  well you should !  i mean ,  nude pictures of anna kournikova ?  i mean ,  she &apos;s never even won a major tournament !  
well ,  i tried billy jean king ,  but .  .  .   you know ,  you and monica have the same  &quot; i &apos;m gonna kill you &quot;  look .  .  .  ?  i can usually make it go away by kissing her .  .  .

you know ,  this happens all the time to my computer at work .  
well ,  what do you do ?  
well ,  i usually go .  .  .  play tetris on somebody else &apos;s computer .  
i can &apos;t believe this .  i can &apos;t believe this is happening .  i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow !  ok ?  i have to stand up in front of all these people .  what am i gonna say ?  
i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions .  
ross ,  we can solve this .  i just heard your speech .  we can recreate it !  we &apos;ve got all night !  
oh wait ,  joey and i are supposed to have dinner  .  
hey don &apos;t worry about that !  i mean ,  ross needs you !  and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can .  
ugh .  
alright ,  ok ,  let &apos;s do it .   uhm ,  i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating .  .  .  uhm ,  and then ,  then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era ,  the breakup of pangea ,  hello !   and then ,  there &apos;s the .  .  .  eh .  .  .  there &apos;s the overview of the triassic .  
hello ?  
who is this ?  
 he .  .  .  he &apos;s gonna propose ?  
look ,  if phoebe wants to marry david ,  she should ,  i &apos;m not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you .  
you don &apos;t tell me what to do !  i tell you what to do !  just call her .  she &apos;s at the paradise hotel in barbados .  and while i &apos;ve got you ,  you &apos;ve got curly hair .  what do you do in humidity ?   damnit !

 oooh !  i hope you &apos;re happy too ,  honey !  
phoebe is going to say  &quot; yes &quot;  to david .  see ,  that &apos;s what happens when you meddle in people &apos;s lives !  
phoebe is going to say  &quot; yes &quot;  ?  that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s great !  
no it &apos;s not ,  b &apos;cause she &apos;s still in love with mike !  
and there &apos;s not chance that will work ?  
no ,  i called him .  it &apos;s not gonna happen .  
 oooooooh !  meddler !  meddler !  
well ,  if you hadn &apos;t meddled to start with ,  i wouldn &apos;t have had to go in there and meddle myself .  now ,  no matter how much we meddle ,  we will never be able to un - meddle the thing that you meddled up  -  in the first place !  
i &apos;m so bored !  stupid rain ,  we .  .  .  we can &apos;t do anything .

uh ,  phoebe ,  uh ,  i have .  .  .  something i wanna say .  
oh my god ,  he &apos;s gonna do it now .  please ,  i cannot watch this ,  let &apos;s go .  
uh ,  phoebe ,  uh .  .  .   you &apos;re an amazing woman ,  and the time we spent apart was ,  was unbearable .  of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn &apos;t help !  
but well ,  now that we &apos;re together again ,  i don &apos;t ever want to be apart .  so ,  to that end .  .  .   
it &apos;s david ,  actually !  
hi david .  chandler .  monica .  .  .   oh !  
hi phoebe .

i have a ring .  
phoebe ,  will you marry me ?

just so i know ,  if i had asked first .  .  .  
is it ok if i hug you now ?  
yes !   
oh ,  ain &apos;t this nice ?  it &apos;s so quiet ,  i could just lie here all day .  
i know

i &apos;m so glad we &apos;ve got adjoining rooms !   
the sun is out !  
hey !  remember when i had corneas ?  
ok listen ,  you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs ,  and i &apos;ll get the magazines and the lotion .  
ladies ?  ross &apos;s speech is in 45 minutes .  
nooo !  
damn it !  
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating .  
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan .  .  .  so leathery and wrinkled ,  i &apos;m so jealous !  
finally ,  factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
 not to mention the cold sores .   
and that &apos;s just the herbivores .  i &apos;m not even gonna discuss the carnivores ,  their heads are already too big .  which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .   
 really ?  
what ?  
you &apos;re .  .  .  you &apos;re kidding ,  right ?  
no ,  he really said it .  
 .  .  .  and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus .  .  .   
erectus ?  
 .  .  .  in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .   thank you !   
oh ,  thanks guys !  
oh !  
 ok .  .  .  now .  .  .  now we &apos;re just holding hands !

 i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again !  oh ,  it &apos;s so unfair !  !  !   
well ,  on the bright side ,  now you won &apos;t have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off .   not you guys .  you got it going on !   
they have a game room downstairs !  ping pong and stuff .  
 ping pong ?   honey ,  they have ping pong !  let &apos;s play !  
i don &apos;t think so !

c &apos;mon guys ,  it &apos;ll be fun !

but can it .  .  .  just .  .  .  happen a little bit ?  
 no ,  no !  it can &apos;t happen at all !  
but why ,  why not ?  
because .  .  .  look ,  no one wants this to happen more than me ,  ok ?   i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no !   i couldn &apos;t do it to ross !  
but that wasn &apos;t gonna stop you before !  
i know ,  i know !  but i &apos;ve thought about it a lot since ,  and it just wouldn &apos;t be right .  .  .   i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  !

 do you really find this attractive on him ?  
 oh ,  yeah !   are you telling me you .  .  .  you &apos;re not even .  .  .  a little turned on by monica ,  right now ?   
i think this is the first time in our marriage that i &apos;ve felt like the more attractive one .  
c &apos;mon mike ,  you can beat her !  knock that dog off her head !   
oh ,  damn it !  
 game ,  point !  
you know ,  you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that .   
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done !   
okay - dokay ,  you &apos;ve each won a game and i &apos;ve lost what &apos;s felt like a year of my life .  so everybody goes home a winner .  
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .  
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil ?  
serve the ball ,  chump .  
i &apos;m just saying ,  i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city ,  well ,  that &apos;d be  just nifty !  
 oh ,  you &apos;re back .  .  .   this is my wife ,  nancy .  
ross ,  can i talk to you for a minute ?  
uh ,  well .  .  .  joey and i broke up .  
joey is a great guy ,  but we &apos;re just .  .  .  so different !  i mean ,  during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus !  
anyway i just ,  uh ,  i think it &apos;s for the best .  
 ok geller .  last day of the conference ,  you know what happens to the keynote speaker .  
yeah ,  can you guys just throw him in the pool later ?  
 ok ,  gentlemen !  please !  aren &apos;t we a little old for this ?  i mean ,  we &apos;re scientists ,  right ?  we &apos;re academics .  and most importantly i .  .  .  you - you will have to catch us first .   .  go ,  go ,  go !   
ok ,  so it &apos;s a tie again ,  41 to 41 .  
 ok ,  look !  enough is enough !  
no ,  i have just to have two more points to beat him !  
monica ,  that was also true an hour ago !  i mean ,  please ,  look at you !  your hand is blistered ,  you can barely stand ,  your hair is inexplicable !  ok ,  you &apos;ve already proven you are just as good as he is ,  now we &apos;ve missed our dinner reservations ,  so now let &apos;s just go upstairs ,  order room service ,  take a shower and shave your head !  
i can &apos;t just walk away !  i &apos;ve put in four hours !  
but .  .  .  
look !  you knew this about me when you married me !  you agreed to take me in sickness and in health .  well ,  this is my sickness !  
what about the obsessive cleaning ?  
that &apos;s just good sense !

mike wins ?  
i can &apos;t believe it !   i lost !

ok ,  we &apos;re taking that paddle home ,  mister .  
 honey ,  you don &apos;t have to do this .  
 yes ,  i do .  now ,  i may not understand why you have to win so badly ,  but if it &apos;s important to you then it &apos;s important to me ,  because i love you .  
but .  .  .  you suck !  
 you &apos;re welcome ,  sweetheart .

i don &apos;t know .  
this is so great !  now we can enter into doubles tournaments !  
thanks !  
are they still looking for us ?  
yeah .  the bartender said that they split up into two search parties ,  the herbivores and the carnivores .   you know ,  we as a group are not the coolest .   
hum ,  so ,  i started to say you something earlier ,  hum .  .  .   there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey .  i kind of realized i .  .  .  was starting to have feelings .  .  .  for someone else .  
i think you know .  
i think i know too but i &apos;ve been really wrong about this stuff in the past ,  so .  .  .   
all right ,  all right .  
i mean ,  you just went out with my best friend ,  and i just think it &apos;d be a really really bad idea .   or - or not !    
oh ,  the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn - on . you wanna .  .  .  ?   
you know ,  i &apos;d love to ,  but i &apos;m a little tired .  
i &apos;ll put a pillowcase over my head .  
you &apos;re on !   
hey !  
what &apos;s up ?  
well ,  okay ,  mike &apos;s taking a shower ,  which by the way there &apos;s no law against .  and then we &apos;re gonna grab some food ,  so if you want .  .  .   
 .  .  .  finally .  .  .  
is that ross ?  
yeah ,  you can hear everything through these stupid walls .  
sounds like he &apos;s with someone .  
he could be alone .  this morning i heard him do push - ups ,  and then talk to his triceps .  
ooh .  .  .  dr .  geller !  
god ,  you &apos;re amazing .  .  .  i didn &apos;t even have to ask you to call me that .

 yeah ,  we had a great time ,  thank you !   
 bye !  
okay ,  uhm .  .  .  hey ,  you guys seen joey anywhere ?

you know where joey is ?  
 .  .  . i really don &apos;t .  .  .   
can i talk to you for a minute ?  
yeah ,  sure .  .  .    
i don &apos;t believe this .  .  .  have you guys been .  .  .  
shhh .  .  .  this is the listening side of the wall .   
and then she told me that she and joey had broken up ,  and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me .  
 uh - huh .  .  .  right .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  
and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her .  
 oh ,  i know .  .  .  i know it &apos;s been really hard for you .  
anyway ,  one thing lead to another ,  and .  .  .  oh .  .  .  before you know it ,  we were kissing .  i mean ,  how angry do you think joey is gonna be ?  
 that is hard to say ,  ross .  that is hard to say .  
you know ,  i gotta go find him .  he &apos;s gotta be here someplace .  
you would think !   
joey !  
is he gone ?  
 how are you doing this ?   
pssst .  .  .  
how .  .  .  wha .  .  .  hey !  what are you .  .  .  what is this ?  have you guys been listening this entire time ?  
now ,  what is this ?  
ah ,  what is this ?  well ,  lets see ,  we kissed for ten minutes and now we &apos;re talking to our friends about it ,  so i guess this is sixth grade !  
oh no .  .  .  have you thought about it how complicated this could get ?  what about ross ?  
well ,  he &apos;s with charlie now .  
yeah ,  but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her .  and as his friend ,  i mean ,  don &apos;t you think he deserves the same from you ?  
 you &apos;re a pain in my ass ,  geller !  
all right ,  look you guys .  .  .  look ,  we appreciate all the advice ,  but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it .  .  .  
okay ,  well we &apos;ll go back in there ,  but will you do one thing for us ?  the people that care about you ?  
sure .  .  .  
enunciate !  
get out !   
are they right ?  
probably ,  yeah .  .  .  i mean ,  maybe we should .  .  .  hold off until we talk to ross .  
yeah .  .  .  yeah ,  we can wait ,  we don &apos;t have to do anything tonight .  
yeah ,  i think that &apos;d be best .  .  .  so ,  so i &apos;m gonna .  .  .  i &apos;m gonna take off .  .  .  
 although .  .  .  
 i like although !  
i mean ,  you know .  .  .  ross and i haven &apos;t dated in like .  .  .  six years .  .  .  
six years ?  wow .  .  .  it &apos;s almost as long as highschool .  .  .  
plus ,  you know ,  he is with charlie now .  
absolutely !  he &apos;s not thinking about you .  
no .  .  .  
i &apos;m thinking about you .  .  .

whoo ,  whoo .  wow ,  it &apos;s uhm .  .  .  kinda weird that i &apos;m sitting next to charlie after we broke up .

look ,  does someone mind switching to sit with charlie ?  
oh ,  i uh ,  i mean ,  i .  .  .  dude ,  i spent the whole conference with charlie .  
i understand .  .  .  
no ,  i &apos;ll do it .   
wish i could switch with someone .  i really don &apos;t wanna sit with allen iverson over there .   
you should be careful when checking your overhead bins ,   &apos;cause items may shift during .  .  .  
you don &apos;t have to go home tonight ,  do you ?

you know what ,  we &apos;re gonna have sex .  let &apos;s just leave it there .   
okay .  .  .  good luck .   
ross is coming over .  i think now would be a really good time to talk to him .  
i guess so .  i &apos;m just .  .  .  really nervous .

well ,  i &apos;m so excited about this .

are you kidding ?  i have had some very dirty dreams about this .  .  .  
excuse me !   you didn &apos;t tell him ,  did you ?  
i couldn &apos;t .  he was saying all these really nice things about me .  i didn &apos;t want him to get mad and take  &apos;em all back .  i &apos;m on a edge on chandler .  
oh god !  alright ,  fine .  you know what joey ,  forget it .  when we go back to new york ,  i will tell him .  
hey ,  it &apos;s mike .  
oh ,  err .  .  .  no ,  she &apos;s not here yet .  you know ,  i think i &apos;m just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone .  .  .  
one more thing .  .  .  there .  .  .  might be a picture of precious on my coffee table .  
anyway ,  i just wanna give you a heads up .  
hi ,  i &apos;m precious ,  who are you ?  
phoebe ?  mike &apos;s ex - girlfriend phoebe ,  the love of his life ?  that phoebe ?  
oh ,  i can &apos;t wait for everyone at work to see these .  .  .   ow !  
you go back to work tomorrow night ,  right ?  
yeah !  
so if you want people to see them ,  then by definition you &apos;re not having them taken out .  .  .  say ,  at the break of dawn ?  
well ,  if i had them taken out ,  then i wouldn &apos;t be able to do this .   you like that ,  right ?   
what are you singing ?  
it &apos;s  &quot; bolero &quot;  from  &quot; 10 &quot;  .  
it &apos;s  &quot; ride of the valkyries &quot;  from  &quot; apocalypse now &quot;  .  .  .  hair problem .  and now that we &apos;re home ,  we don &apos;t have that problem anymore ,  so if you think about it .  .  .  i hate them !  
you what ?  you said you liked them .  
did i ?  let &apos;s refresh .  i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp .  
fine ,  so you don &apos;t like them .  everybody else does .  
again ,  let &apos;s journey back .  .  .  as i recall what rachel said ,  was she had never notice the shape of your skull before .  and joey .  .  .  well ,  joey didn &apos;t realise that there was anything different .  
you know what ?  i don &apos;t care .  i like it like this ,  and i &apos;m gonna keep it .  you &apos;re just jealous because your hair can &apos;t do this .  .  .   ouch !  
hit yourself in the tooth ?  
 hi .  .  .  there she is .  hi emma .  oh my god ,  i missed you .   oh emma ,  i missed you so much .  hey .  .  .  did you have a good time with grandma green ?  huh ?  did she give you a bottle of anti - depressants again to use as a rattle ?   
that was one time ,  ross ,  and they were only like 5 milligrams .  
ooh hey ,  emma ,  daddy has some presents for you okay ?  okay ?  i want you to wait right here .  come here sweetie .  
aaah .  .  .  ross ,  actually there &apos;s something that i really need to talk to you about .  
 okay ,  shoot !  
okay ,  uhm .  .  .  alright ,  here &apos;s the deal .  
 oh no !  
what ?  what is it ?  
oh ,  major shampoo explosion !  
uh ,  look ross ,  this really isn &apos;t easy .  
oh ,  it &apos;s all over everything .  why ?  why me ?   
because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo ?  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry .  you were saying ?  
well ,  yeah .  .  .  okay ,  look it &apos;s about me and .  .  .  
oh ,  not another one !  oh my g .  .  .  and this is moisturiser .  it &apos;s even harder to clean !  why ?  why do bad things happen to good people ?  
wow !  well ,  clearly this is not a good time .  
i &apos;m not letting you leave until you tell me what &apos;s going on here .  i mean ,  are you guys getting back together or something ?  
my name is precious .  
i just can &apos;t believe this .  .  .  why ?  
oh ,  why would he do this ?  i mean ,  what &apos;s wrong with me ?  
i mean ,  what the hell am i supposed to do now ?  
damn it woman ,  pull yourself together !  have some pride ,  for the love of god .   
i just can &apos;t believe that mike didn &apos;t give me any warning .  
he proposed to you ?  this is the worst birthday ever .   
screw you ,  mike .  you &apos;re a coward and a bastard ,  and i hope you rot in hell .   
honey ,  you &apos;ve been in there for a long time .  .  .  is everything okay ?  
not really .   
i have a problem .  
really ?  what happened ?  
well ,  i was dancing around ,  and singing  &quot; no woman ,  no cry &quot;  and i got stuck .  
you can &apos;t move at all ?  
oh ,  well ,  i can move .  .  .   
if i untangle you ,  will you please get rid of the corn rose ?  
 i guess so .  .  .  
 some of these look a little frayed .  
hey !  
hi !  
so ,  did you err .  .  .  did you tell ross ?  
well ,  i tried ,  but then he had a shampoo related emergency .  so i guess now it &apos;s your turn again .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  i think it &apos;s better if you tell him ,  you know .  it &apos;s easier for a woman .  that way ,  you know ,  if he gets mad ,  all you have to do is go .  .  .  i didn &apos;t mean it .  i &apos;m so so -  - ooory .   
yeah ,   &apos;cause that &apos;s what we do .  
alright ,  alright ,  okay ,  uhm .  .  .  how  &apos;bout this ,  how about this ?  tomorrow .  .  .  tomorrow we &apos;ll both go and we &apos;ll tell him together .  
okay ,  that sounds fair .  it just means that once again we can &apos;t .  .  .  
i know ,  i know .  .  .  ,  but that &apos;s okay .  i mean ,  we can control ourselves ,  we &apos;re not animals .  
no !  of course we can wait .  alright ,  so i guess that means good night then ?  
yeah !  good night !   
goo -  - ood night !  
good night !   
seriously ,  good night !  
stop saying good night .  
look what i found in the drawer .  .  .   and you said i &apos;d never wear this .  .  .  
now that i untangled you ,  how  &apos;bout you doing a little something for me ?  
sure ,  what do you have in mind ?  
i think you know .  
really ?  i don &apos;t really feel like it .  
this is what i want to do .  
okay ,  i just don &apos;t get why you like it so much .  
 she &apos;s an fbi agent ,  posing as a beauty contestant .   with ross seeing joey and rachel kissing .  rosss tares at them . ] 
okay ,  ross ,  i realise that you didn &apos;t expect to walk in and see that ,  but .  .  let me explain ,  okay ?  
we weren &apos;t doing anything !  
rach ,  he just saw us .  
shhh .  
but what you saw ,  that is the extent of it ,  okay ?  one kiss .  
no ,  come on ,  that is a lie .  we also kissed in barbados .  okay ,  we also kissed in barbados ,  but we didn &apos;t plan it ,  okay ?  and the only reason that that happened was because i saw you kissing charlie .  
yeah ,  you started it !  i &apos;ve got to chill .  
look ,  we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened ,  but .  .  
we feel so terrible about this ,  ross .  
yeah ,  but it did happen ,  so .  .  .   
ross ?  
ross ,  say something .  anything .  
so you two are .  .  ?  
and have you  .  .  ed ?  
no ,  no ,  no !  
no ,  no ,  no !  
but if i hadn &apos;t walked in here ,  would you .  .  ?  
probably .   
no ,  no !  
ross ,  this is not how we wanted you to find out about this .  you have every right to go nuts .  
i &apos;m not going nuts .  do you see me go nuts ?  
no ,  but you know what i mean .

there &apos;s a hair in my coffee .   
hey guys !

hey ,  have you seen frank jr .  ,   &apos;cause he &apos;s meeting me here with the triplets .

oh ,  my goodness ,  they &apos;ve all gotten so big !   
ah ,  can i just say i know we &apos;re doing this for ross ,  and that &apos;s cool ,  but if it was up to me ,  this is not what we &apos;d be doing on our first date .

oh ,  you bet .   
actually .  .  it &apos;s stuff you left at my apartment .  
and you know ,  you can just give me my stuff whenever you want .  
yeah ,  i didn &apos;t throw any of that out .  .   
i thought i heard voices !  hi charlie !   hi joey .   and .  .  oh !  you &apos;re gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend .   i &apos;m just kidding ,  i know rachel ,  i know .   come ,  please come in .  come in .  
okay ,  well ,  we brought you some wine .  
oh !  that is so thoughtful .   she &apos;s a keeper .  and what did you bring me ?

okay ,  listen ,  hey ,  ross .  why don &apos;t you try to relax ,  okay ?  maybe have a drink .  
oh ,  god .  so adorable .  look at them sleeping there like angels .  moments ,   &apos;cause before you know it ,  they &apos;re gonna be awake again .  
well ,  they may be a handful ,  but they &apos;re so cute .  
oh ,  god ,  the last time i babysat them ,  they did the funniest thing .  .  
that &apos;s a ,  that &apos;s a long time .  it is ,  phoebe .  there &apos;s just so many of them .  you know ,  two i can handle .  two &apos;s great .  you just hold one in each hand ,  but what do i do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on .  i &apos;ve got no more hands to protect my area !  there &apos;s three of them ,  phoebe ,  three !  
yeah ,  i know ,  frank .  i counted them when they were coming out of my area .  oh ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  i can &apos;t say it ,  it &apos;s too horrible .  no .  
what ?  
oh my god ,  frank ,  are you thinking of leaving ?  because i didn &apos;t have those triplets so you could just run out on them !  that .  no .  i just was thinking that ,  you know ,  maybe you could take one .  
we went through the same thing when we were adopting .  
so ,  a lot of malfunctioning wee - wees and hoo - hoos in this room ,  huh ?   
i mean ,  you have a lovely home .  
it &apos;s pretty much all the information you need .  
everything is broken down into categories ,  and then cross - referenced ,  and then colour - coded to correspond with the forms in the back .  
i know the process is frustrating ,  but it &apos;s so worth it .  adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us .  
that &apos;s great .   can i see the book ?   
you want me to wash my hands first ,  don &apos;t you ?  
i would have told him to do it too .  
can i adopt you ?   
yeah .  
you were ?  
huh ?  
i have a badge in it .  
you wanna see it ?  
what ?  !  ?  
i &apos;m adopted ?   
the first batch of margaritas was not so great ,  but the second batch is gooooood .  
well ,  maybe the next batch ,  we could all get some .  
oh ,  guys ,  this is fun ,  isn &apos;t it ?  you know ?  just the four of us .  just hangin &apos; .  
dude ,  are you okay ?  and when are the fajitas gonna be ready ?  
i &apos;m fine !  hey ,  i &apos;m great !  i &apos;m just .  .  i &apos;m just proud of us .  there &apos;s no weirdness ,  no tension .  
no awareness .  
we make a great foursome .  we should do more stuff together .  ooh !  let &apos;s take a trip .  okay ,  where do you think we  -  we can go ?   
my fajitas !  !   
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  have i made this evening uncomfortable ?   
fajitas !  be careful ,  very hot plate ,  very hot plate !  !  
ross ,  you don &apos;t even have oven mitts on !   
okay ,  well ,  this is crazy .  can &apos;t seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids ,  can we ?  
insane .  
alice would never go for it ,  right ?  tired ,  too ,  i think we &apos;ve got her onboard .  
well ,  just you know ,  for argument &apos;s sake ,  you know ,  hypothetically .  which one would you be willing to give up ?  
frank jr . jr .  ?  good one .  i mean ,  you know ,  he &apos;s really funny .  like ,  the other day he made up this joke .  
uh - huh .  i &apos;m a frog &quot;  ?  a talking frog !   oh ,  no ,  you can &apos;t have him ,  he &apos;s too funny .  
well ,  alright ,  that &apos;s fine .  what about leslie ?  she &apos;s ,  she &apos;s the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet .  
alright ,  so that leaves chandler .  chandler ,  no .  no ,  no .  she &apos;s my little genius .  i got big hopes for her .  she &apos;s gonna be a doctor or a realtor .  .  
wow ,  frank .  i think we just ran out of kids .  oh ,  wow .  phoebe ,  i don &apos;t think i can give one of them up .  i mean ,  you know ,  they drive me crazy ,  but they &apos;re my babies .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  frank .  i didn &apos;t realise things were so bad .  you know ,  i &apos;ll help out more .  i can  -  i can babysit any time you want .  you name the day ,  and i &apos;ll be there .  
well ,  that &apos;s not good .  but you know ,  i can move some stuff around ,  and i &apos;ll be there .  you and alice just take the whole day together .  
where are bill and colleen ?  
they &apos;re in the kitchen getting something to eat .  can you believe how nice they are ?  
we have to leave !  !  
why ?  what did you do in the bathroom ?  
i didn &apos;t get to the bathroom .  i bumped into owen on the way ,  and he didn &apos;t know he was adopted .  and there &apos;s a slight chance i may have told him .  
i &apos;ll go get him in a second .  by the way ,  you should know we haven &apos;t told him he &apos;s adopted yet .  
i &apos;m adopted ?  !  
he told me !  and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell .  
you told him he &apos;s adopted ?  
everyone ?  i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey .  
ooy .  
and to love .  ah ,  love .  l - o - v - e ,  love .  l is for life .  and what is life without love ?  
oh my god ,  are we supposed to answer ?  
o is for  &quot; oh ,  wow !  &quot;  the v is for this very surprising turn of events ,  which i &apos;m still fine with by the way .  e is for how extremely normal i find it .  that you two are together .  and now one day you might get married and have children of your own .   
dude ,  are you okay ?  
totally .  
wait ,  ross .  ross .  i  -  i have to take off .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i have a really early class in the morning ,  but this has been lovely .

god ,  rachel ,  what ross just said that is just so .  .  
bye .   
okay ,  i guess it &apos;s just flan for three !  hey ,  hey ,  that rhymed !  
you know what ,  ross ?  i think we &apos;re gonna take off too .  
oh ,  oh .  of course .  god ,  i &apos;m so stupid .  you guys are a couple now .  i mean ,  you probably just want to be alone .  
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s just that it &apos;s getting late .  .  .  
hey ,  hey ,  it &apos;s fine .  it &apos;s totally fine .  we &apos;ve got plenty of margaritas .  it &apos;s all good .   
i don &apos;t even know what that &apos;s for .   
you know what ?  i think i &apos;m gonna stay here and make sure he &apos;s okay .  
yeah ,  that &apos;s probably a good idea .  
yeah .  i &apos;ll see you in the morning .

no ,  no ,  no .  you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago - soundtrack .  look ,  ross ,  about ,  about rachel and i .  listen ,  you don &apos;t have to worry about that ,  okay ?  because nothing is gonna happen .  
what do you mean ?  
well ,  she and i said from the beginning that we weren &apos;t gonna do anything unless you were okay with it .  and clearly .  .  
hey ,  what are you talking about ?  i &apos;m fine !  
it &apos;s okay ,  ross ,  alright ?  i totally understand .  of course you &apos;re not fine .  you &apos;re .  .  you &apos;re ross and rachel .  
except we &apos;re not .  i mean ,  we haven &apos;t been a couple in like ,  six years .  oh my god ,  is that right ?  has it been that long ?  
that &apos;s what i hear ,  yeah .  
this is crazy .  i mean ,  six years ?  and because of me you guys aren &apos;t gonna be together ?  can i ask you something ?  really ,  what is this thing with you and rachel ?

 i am scrappy .  
exactly !  look ,  no matter what i tried to do ,  i couldn &apos;t keep you out of my life .  of all the people i have cut out ,  you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in .  
it &apos;s because i &apos;m scrappy .  
yeah ,  you are .  and i &apos;m so glad that you fought your way back in ,  because i don &apos;t know what i would do without you .  
i won &apos;t know what i would do without you .   
well ,  i guess we should go back in .  when you gave me another chance ,  i guess we should do the same for amanda .  
can you believe it .  i &apos;ve never had any professional dance training .   
now ,  let me explain how this works .  you go into the booth ,  and .  .  .  
 okay .  .  .   
wait a minute ,  there &apos;s two sets of nozzles ,  which one is it ?   
which .  .  .  which .  .  .  which .  .  .  which one is it ?   
oh !  son of a bitch !   
 
what is the matter with us ?  
well ,  i know what &apos;s the matter with me .  
no ,  i mean with us ,  you know .  i mean ,  is it supposed to be this .  .  .  difficult ?  
i don &apos;t know .   
that fake british woman is a real bitch ,  but she sure can dance .  .  .  hey !  
hi !  hey ,  listen ,  can we ask you a question ?  when you and monica first hooked up ,  was it weird going from friends to .  .  .  more than that ?  
kinda .  .  .  you know ,  sneaking around ,  having to hide from you guys .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  no ,  i mean .  .  .  se - x - u - ally .  .  .  
yeah ,  was there a part of you that .  .  .  felt like it was .  .  .  really wrong ?  
actually ,  no .  no ,  it felt right .  you know ,  it felt like uhm .  .  .  i can &apos;t believe we haven &apos;t been doing this the whole time .   
i can tell from your expressions that that &apos;s the good news you were hoping for .  .  .  well ,  i &apos;m gonna go continue to .  .  .  spread the joy .  
well ,  just because it happened that way for them doesn &apos;t mean it has to happen that way for us .  
yeah ,  yeah .  .  .  absolutely .  i mean ,  just because something &apos;s difficult doesn &apos;t mean that you quit .  
right ,  totally .  
yeah ,  so we just keep trying and trying until we .  .  .  do it .  
yeah ,  and if doesn &apos;t work ,  then we &apos;ll be just one of those couples that never have sex .  
that &apos;s a .  .  .  pla - an .   
 wow .  .  .  i did not see this coming .  
i know .  
i don &apos;t get it .  i mean ,  i was so sure this was what i wanted .  
hmmm .  .  .  me too .  .  .   
i wonder how monica and chandler could do it ?  
i guess they weren &apos;t as good friends as we are .   
aah .  .  .  i bet you &apos;re right .   
so .  .  .  
yeah .  
i love ya .  
love you too .  .  .  alright ,  i &apos;m going to bed .  
yeah ,  me too .

dude ,  it &apos;s chandler .  let me in .   
go away !  i don &apos;t want to see anybody .  
i know ,  i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me .  you have to let me in .  
really ?  did you count mississipily ?   
dude ,  you &apos;re not tanned .  
no ,  i just had to get a picture of this .   
 hey guys !  ross ,  rachel 
honey ,  i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend .  
that place in vermont ?  you can take a hint !  
wait ,  you can &apos;t go away this weekend !  it &apos;s emma &apos;s birthday !  
yeah !  
we &apos;re having a party .  
well ,  can &apos;t you just have the party when we get back ?  
no .  
no ,  that day .  .  .  that won &apos;t be her real birthday !  
gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was !  
c &apos;mon you guys ,  this is really important to us .  
well ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  but chandler and i could really use a weekend away .  you know ,  to reconnect .  .  .  emotionally .  
there &apos;s this thing i really want us to do .  i read about it in maxim .  .  .  
well ,  can &apos;t you just go to vermont the next day ?  
yeah ,  we want everyone to be there .  as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister .  
and i mean ,  you know ,  you guys .  .  .  this is a big deal .  i mean ,  how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle !  
all right ,  we &apos;ll stay .  we can just drive up after the party .  
fine ,  but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party .  .  .  
you know pheebs ,  when i was little ,  on my birthday ,  my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house ,  and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find  &apos;em all .  
oooh ,  i love family traditions like that .  when uhm .  .  .  when ursula and i were kids ,  on our birthday ,  our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food !  
 hey guys !  rachel 
hey ,  i brought the camera for emma &apos;s video .  
oh ,  good ,  good !  we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we &apos;ll give it to her when she is 18 .  
oh ,  cool !  !  wow ,  it &apos;s like a time capsule !  
yeah !  
oh ,  just think .  .  .  she &apos;s gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn &apos;t even been invented yet !  with friends who right now are just like babies !  and they &apos;ll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people !  
that &apos;s the hope !  so ,  is emma awake yet ?  
oh no ,  it &apos;s still nap time .  but she &apos;ll be up soon .  
ah ,  and where is joey ?  
i said it &apos;s still nap time .   
 hey ,  there is uncle joey !  
hey !  
hey ,  say something to emma on her 18th birthday !  
18 ,  uh ?   
joey ,  no !  
what ,  what !  ?  it &apos;s for her hot friends !  
when they see this you &apos;ll be 52 !  
and starting to think about settling down !  
hey joey ,  will you please set this up for people to put emma &apos;s presents on ?  
i &apos;d love to !  yeah !  
 we were supposed to bring presents ?  
yeah !  i wrote emma a song .  
oh ,  yeah !  how was i supposed to know ?  
joey ,  it &apos;s a birthday party .  
yeah ,  but for a one - year - old .  what &apos;s the point .  .  .  the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup .  just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer .  and he &apos;s standing next to this cow and the cow says  &quot; el - moo &quot;  !   yeah .  .  .  that &apos;s a funny cup !   
hey !  
hey hey !  where &apos;s the birthday girl ?  
oh ,  she &apos;s still napping 
oh ,  sure ,  she was probably up all night ,  excited about the party she knows is happening .  
look ,  i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn &apos;t a really big deal to you ,  but it really is to us ,  ok ?  emma will never have a first birthday again .  
all right .  .  .  you &apos;re right .  we &apos;re sorry .  now let &apos;s wake up emma and get the fun time started !  
no really ,  she didn &apos;t sleep well last night ,  so we can &apos;t wake her up .  
hi !  
 hey !  
 i remember your first birthday !  ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you .  he pulled on his testicles so hard !  we had to take him to the emergency room !  
 there &apos;s something you didn &apos;t know about your dad !  
thank you !  
which one are you ?   
i can &apos;t believe emma is still asleep !  
i know ,  what are we gonna do ?  
i &apos;ve got a plan .  i &apos;ve got a plan .  i &apos;m going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs .  you &apos;re gonna scream out and that &apos;ll wake her up !  
i &apos;m not going to vermont with this monica !  
hey pheebs ,  you know what ?  i was thinking .  .  .  since you wrote a song ,  maybe i could do something for emma using my talents !  
so youre gonna .  .  .  hit on her ?  
no ,  no ,  no !  my talents as an actor !  
oh !  
you know ,  i could like maybe .  .  .  i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books !  
or you could stick a fork in an apple !  
hey ,  i think emma might like it !  
oh !  emma might like what ?  
um ,  my present !  
what did you get her ?  
actually we prepared performances .  
separate performances .  
but equally real !  
well ,  this sounds like fun !  well ,  you know what ?  actually ?  people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap ,  so would you mind performing them once now ?  
sure ,  yeah !  
 o k .  
 all right ,  lets get this party started ,  huh ?  joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us .  
oh ,  great !  
 are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared ?  
hey ,  i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting !  
so ,  joey ,  what are you gonna do for us ?  
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emmas books .  
oh ,  ok ,  which one ?  
uh ,  why ,  its a .  .  .   one of her favorites ,  uh ,   riding the storm out .  coping with post - partum depression eesh !   love you forever .  love you forever .  by robert munsch .  published by firefly books .  printed  in mexico .  a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth ,  back and forth ,  back and forth ,  and while she held him she sang ill love you forever ,  ill like you for always ,  as long as i &apos;m living ,  my baby youll be .   .  and while he rocked her ,  he sang ill love you forever ,  ill like you for always ,  as long as i &apos;m living ,  my baby youll be .  
 wow !  that was amazing !  
thank you so much for that gift !  chandler 
amazing .  .  .  amazing .  
oh ,  phoebe ,  im sorry !  phoebe has prepared something as well .  
thats right ,  i &apos;ve prepared a song for emma .  from my heart to hers .  for theres no greater gift ,  than the gift of music .   emma !  your name poses a dilemma .   &apos;cause not much else rhymes with emma !  maybe the actor richard crenna ,  he played the commanding officer in rambo .  happy birthday emma !  
is that it ?  
ok ,  cut !  great .  that was .  .  .  that was just .  .  .  yeah !  
ross ,  um ,  dont forget to get a shot of emmas cake .  its in a box in the fridge .  
sure .  
oh ,  you &apos;re gonna love this cake .  i got it from a bakery in new jersey ,  corinos .  
oh my god ,  that place has the creamiest frosting !  i use to hitchhike there when i was a kid .  
well ,  anyway ,  they make these great novelty cakes ,  in all different shapes ,  and if you give them a photo ,  theyll copy it in icing !  
oh ,  did you do a picture of emma ?  
yes !  on a cake shaped like a bunny .  
uh ,  rach ?  does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes ?  say for bachelorette parties ?  
ross ,  what are you talking about ?   oh !  oh my god !  they put my babys face on a penis !  phoebe 
i know what you &apos;re thinking judy ,  the resemblance is uncanny !  
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again .  rachel ok ?  i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughters birthday and i need a bunny cake ,  right now !  
ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babys face off the penis ,  so we can put it on the bunny .   .  that is a weird sentence !  
oh !  believe you me !  i am going to bring this cake back ,  i don &apos;t even want it in my home .  .  .   joey ,  don &apos;t touch it !  !  
i &apos;m so confused !  
 yes ,  yes .  i still want my daughters picture ,  but on a bunny cake .  yellow cake ,  chocolate frosting with nuts !  
to be fair this one does have nuts .    
hey mon ,  that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake .  
oh .  so nice of her to pull my hair ,   &apos;till i dropped the key !  
well ,  you know what ?  while we &apos;re waiting ,  you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday ,  huh ?   ok !  
hi emma !  it &apos;s the year 2020 .  are you still enjoying your nap ?  
we &apos;re aunt monica and uncle chandler ,  by the way .  you may not recognize us ,  because we haven &apos;t spoken to your parents in seventeen years !  
we used to be married ,  but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled .  because of you !  happy birthday .   
ross ,  rachel promised it would be over by now .  we seriously have to go ,  if we want to get to vermont .  i called them and the last train leaves in a half hour .  
and you know ,  i have a massage client soon .

 oh !  well that &apos;s it !  he &apos;s the last one to go .  i &apos;m locking you guys in .

oh !  i forgot you used to live here !   
 joey !  it &apos;s estelle !  
so ,  how did your audition go today ?

well ,  oh ,  ok now .  .  .  only one of us has to stay with emma .  ok ,  and as the person who realized that ,  i get to go !  
no !  no !  let &apos;s figure out a fair way to decide who &apos;s staying .  
oh !  i got it !  ok ,  everyone pick a number from one to ten .  alright ?  whoever gets the highest number gets to go first .  
 ok ,  ten .  
okay ,  monica picks ten ,  i call nine !  anyone else ?  
no ,  lets just draw straws .  
or .  .  we could flip a coin ,  and then multiply the .  .  
i &apos;m begging you stop .  
right .  
her birthday .  we can make them race ,  and whoever comes in last ,  stays !  
 yeah !  !  let &apos;s do that !  
 that sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in vermont !  
everybody get your toys !   
ok !  i want the dolphin !  
thats a bear .  
i &apos;m too excited !  
phoebe ,  you get the bear ,  uhm ,  joey ,  you get the robot ,  and chandler and i get the dog .  ok ,  and the race is going to go  from here to here .  now the one who comes in last ,  stays !

good job alan !  
hey ,  good race you guys .  
yeah ,  see you later !   
no !  no ,  no .  .  .  wait !  we didn &apos;t lose .   the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser .  well ,  our dog never crossed the finish line ,  so technically .  .  .  
they left .   the freeway .  rachel is driving monica &apos;s porsche ,  while using her mobile phone .  ross is sitting next to her . ] 
 no ,  there isn &apos;t time to go to the bakery .  we &apos;re just gonna come home .  .  .  everybody left ?  alright ,  well just tell emma we &apos;re gonna be there as soon as we can .   bye .  .  .   
rachel !  
ooh !  god !  sorry !  
 i can &apos;t believe they gave you a ticket .  you &apos;re such a good driver .   
emma &apos;s awake .  
yeah ?  
i can &apos;t believe this .  this is her first birthday .  she &apos;s awake .  we &apos;re not even there .  everybody left .  we still have this stupid obscene cake .  
hey ,  maybe i can fix that ,  you know .  try to turn it into something else .   
oh ,  why do you even bother ?  i already ruined her first birthday .  .  .  and do you know how important these early experiences are ross ?  very !  according to the back cover of that book that you gave me .  
rach ,  she &apos;s not going to remember this .  
 i guess .  .  .  oh ,  i just had such an idea of what this day would be like ,  you know ?  emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing  &quot; happy birthday &quot;  .  then we would all go into .  .  .  hey get out of the road you stupid student driver !  !  !   they have to learn !  
 hey !  
what ?  
it &apos;s not bad .  
 oh my god !  look what .  .  .  you made it into a bunny .  how did you do that ?  
well ,  i just made these two things uhm .  .  .  cheeks .  and then i split this to make ears .  
well ,  i &apos;m very impressed .  
some can sing ,  some can dance .  i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures .  rachel and joey &apos;s apartment .  chandler ,  monica and emma are sitting on the floor ,  and emma &apos;s stuffed animals are lined up in front of them . ] 
now another way to organise your stuffed animals ,  is by size .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  is this a game for emma or for monica ?  
game ?  
emma ,  you even know it &apos;s your birthday today ?  you &apos;re one !  one - year - old ,  that &apos;s little .   
ooh !  that &apos;s my girl !  
that &apos;s how old you are .  
did i teach her that ?  did i just .  .  .  impart wisdom ?  
 ooh ,  i want one .  .  .  
me too .  .  .   
there &apos;s no - one around .  why don &apos;t we just take this one ?  
 .  .  . and head to canada !  
i was kidding .  
i wasn &apos;t .  let &apos;s get going !   
hey ,  are ross and rachel back ?  
no ,  not yet .  
oh good ,  i didn &apos;t miss the party .  
what about your massage client ?  
i just felt so bad ,  missing this .  so i just slipped him a little something ,  you know .  as long as i &apos;m back in five or six hours ,  it will be alright .   
okay ,  if ross and rachel ask ,  i &apos;ve been here the whole time .  the whole time !   
 i &apos;ve been here the whole time !  
joey ,  we just saw you come in .  you ran past us on the stairs .  
i don &apos;t care that you left .  i &apos;m just glad that you &apos;re here .  thanks you guys !  
hey ,  guys !  come on !  you gotta see what emma just did .

rachel and joey &apos;s .  joey &apos;s home alone ,  reading a sports illustrated magazine when chandler enters . ] 
look ,  i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t give them your tape .  and i promise ,  next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not .  
that &apos;s not the point chandler .  the point is that you lied .  
central perk .  monica ,  phoebe and rachel are on the couch . ] 
oh my god !   
excellent !  
now ,  what do you say ?  
lying is wrong !  
and ?  .  .  .  and ?  
i &apos;m a pretty little girl .  
central perk .  some time later that day .  the group has left and charlie is there when ross enters . ] 
did you get the grant ?  
what ?  
benji isn &apos;t in love with me .  i mean ,  he broke up with me .  and besides ,  he &apos;s a very ethical man .  
i &apos;m sure he was just joking ,  ross .  
seriously ?  
well ,  if it &apos;s like the lake mbosco in congo ,  then m - b - o .  .  .  
dr .  geller .  .  .  ?  charlie .  .  .  what are you .  .  .  what are you doing here ?  
like i tried to tell you in the interview ross ,  this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia .  
alright ,  it &apos;s true .  i behaved horribly .  but it &apos;s only because i still love you .  and i would do anything to have you back in my life .  
i never should have broken up with you .  i think about you all the time .  i mean ,  do you ever still think about me ?  
yes !  
i don &apos;t know what to say ,  benji .  this is all so .  .  .  .  romantic .  
maybe .  .  .  
i love you too !   
joey &apos;s bedroom .  joey &apos;s asleep with hugsy ,  the penguin right next to him . ]  
gladys ?   
ha ha ha ,  third time this week .  man ,  this does not get old .  
you &apos;re mean !  
oh ,  don &apos;t be such a baby !    
 
hey you guys !  
hey !  
oh ,  figuring out our wedding plans .  
that &apos;s funny ,  we were doing the same thing !  
yeah !  
it &apos;s really crazy !  the hall ,  the dress ,  the food .  .  .  i - i had no idea how expensive this stuff was !  
yeah it is really pricey .  i mean ,  i freaked when i first heard the numbers .  
so what did you two do about it ?  
it was pretty simple actually ,  i came up with a couple of cost - cutting solutions ,  wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell .  
i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry .  
yeah ,  and i &apos;m responsible for just like half of that .  
are you serious ?  
i think it would make me wanna marry you even more .   
i &apos;ve got to say you guys ,  that &apos;s an incredible gesture !  
 maybe you do that next time you get married !  
no ,  no ,  no .  the next time it &apos;s gonna be a hawaii at sunset .   but maybe the time after that !  opening credits 
 
hey !  
hey !  
what &apos;s going on ?  
our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment .  
 we ?  
you know you don &apos;t want me to help .  you can &apos;t have it both ways !  
hey ,  is this person who decides whether or not you .  .  .  get a baby ?  
kind of .  she &apos;s coming by to interview us and see where we live .  
and it has to go perfectly ,  because if she doesn &apos;t like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state .  
hey ,  maybe i should stop by !  she could be a soap opera fan !  it &apos;s very impressive when the little people know a celebrity .  
 little people ?  
 celebrity .  
ok ,  so i think i &apos;m just about done here ,  unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere ,  like .  .  .  porn or cigarettes ?  
what .  .  .  ?  no !  
chandler ?  
 i don &apos;t ,  and i &apos;m offended by the insinuation !  
ok ,  so there &apos;s not a magazine under the couch ,  or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank ,  or a filthy video in the vcr ?  
i &apos;ll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine ,  but that tape is not mine .  
it isn &apos;t mine !  
yes .  we &apos;re here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children .  is always appreciated .  
well ,  i think you &apos;re gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one  
completely anonymous .  from two kind strangers .  
not necessary .  
and  &quot; x &quot;  is spelled uhm .  .  .   &quot; mike hannigan &quot;  .  thank you both very much .  
it does .  it feels really good !  
oh ,  look !  and we get these free t - shirts !   to the gym .  
 hi !  
hi !  emma will be up in a minute !  
oh ,  good !  
oh hey ross .  .  .  listen ,  i heard about you and charlie .  i &apos;m really sorry .  
oh ,  that &apos;s ok .  i &apos;m sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there .  
absolutely .  
there was one !  she &apos;s it !  all the rest look like they should live under a bridge !  
so ,  uhm .  .  .  what are you gonna do today ?  
well ,  i was thinking of taking emma to the playground !  
oh my god ,  what !  ?  
like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire !  
ok ,  look ,  ross .  i do not want emma going to the playground .  
be - caaauuuse .  .  .  
 all right ,  well ,  if you must know .  .  .  i had a traumatic .  .  .  swing incident .  .  .  when i was little .  
seriously ?  
yes ,  i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain .  and to get me out my mom had to - had to cut a big chunk of my hair !   and it was uneven for weeks !  
 and you made it through that ?  i wonder who &apos;s gonna play you in the movie !  
ok ,  fine !  you can make fun of me .  i do not want emma going there .  and i was thinking claire danes .  
look ,  i &apos;m sorry to hear about your tragedy ,  ok ?  but the swings are perfectly safe ,  and besides emma loves them .  you know what ,  you should come with us and you &apos;ll see !  
ross ,  those things go like 40 miles an hour !  ok ?  when you &apos;re .  .  .  and there is that moment when you are at the top ,  when you just don &apos;t know if you &apos;re gonna return back to earth !  
space is filled with orbiting children .   look ,  please ,  just come on ,  you know ,  when youll see the look on emmas face ,  i swear you wont regret it .  
all right !  
good ,  you dont want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children ,  do you ?  
irrational ,  huh ?  all right ,  well ,  ill remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment !  
oh my god ,  the adoption lady is early !  
ok ,  ok ,  here we go .  
ok .  
here we go .  stand up straight .   big smile .

awe ,  this is so sweet of you !  but you know what ?  i wont be needing a veil ,  i actually wont be wearing a dress at all !  
i told you !  i am not coming to a naked wedding !

thats crazy !   .  i am sorry .  i just cant imagine giving up my one wedding day like that !  
we ,  you know ,  were different !  we dont care about having a huge party .   this is really nice for you ,  but ,  oh ,  please ,  i put this on ?   and ,  ow ,  i look  ,  why ,  well ,  radiant .   all right ,  well ,  who cares ,  i dont need a pretty veil and a fancy dress .  
thats right .  youre making a commitment and thats the same ,  whether you do that at the plaza or ,  where are you gonna do it ?  
city hall .  
ow !   oh ,  that sounds nice !  i am just there for jury duty .  they really spruce that place up !  
its ok ,  its ok .  i made my decision .  what i really want is a great big wedding  
yay !  
but you already gave all your money to charity !  
well ,  ill just ask for it back !  
i dont think you can do that !  
why not !  this is her wedding day ,  this is way more important than some stupid kids !  
ok ,  careful .  
ok .  
careful ,  watch her hair .  watch her hair !  
rach ,  shes got like three hairs !  
i know  but theyre just so beautiful !  oh ,  my god ,  i just pulled one out .

the donation we made earlier ,  we k ,  we w ,  we want it back .  
yeah !  this feels really good .  
i am sorry .  i am ,  but this wedding is just really important to me .  their check from a drawer) besides its probably a good thing .  we really would have been spoiling the children ,  all those food ,  and warm clothing

is that that couple on the first floor ?  because we should get a baby before them .  yeah !  that guy tried to sell me drugs .   
oh .  .  .  
i just realized why i remember this place .  
oh ,  it &apos;s nothing .  i went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn &apos;t end very well .  
yes !  
yeah ,  we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn &apos;t .

no wait ,  okay ,  okay ,  i have an idea .  i want you to get on the swing ,  okay ?  and you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s nothing to be afraid of .  
 i know what this is all about .  .  .  you &apos;ve always been jealous of my hair .  
look ,  i just think you &apos;re an adult ,  okay ?  and you should get over your silly fears .  
alright fine .  i &apos;ll do it .

alright ,  fine .  we &apos;ll give the money back .  
and if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time ,  my friend hasn &apos;t shot anyone in a really long time .  
well ,  i must say ,  this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in .  
oh !  well ,  actually ,  before we look around ,  let me make sure i have everything i need up to here .  .  .   
 why don &apos;t i show you the baby &apos;s room ?   
what the hell are you doing ?  
well ,  you wouldn &apos;t let me in ,  so i thought you were in trouble .  
well ,  we &apos;re not .  
but you called me  &apos;bert &apos; !  ?  that &apos;s our code word for danger !  
we don &apos;t have a code word .  
we don &apos;t ?  we really should .  from now on ,   &apos;bert &apos; will be our code word for danger .   
so that was the baby &apos;s room .   
 what room should we see next ?  
any room that isn &apos;t behind this couch !   
  some people don &apos;t get him ,  but i think he &apos;s really funny !   .   
 i did not care for that !  
 you have to get out of here .  you slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed ,  so she can &apos;t see you .

what ?  i reject your money .  
but .  .  .  but .  .  .  but we &apos;re giving you this !  come on !  consider it a contribution .   
well ,  i mean .  .  .  it sounds good to me .  and that way we can save up ,  come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation .  you ask for brian .

hey guys !  
hi !  
hey !  
we need to talk to you about something .  
what ?  
hey !  
are you kidding ?  
well ,  it &apos;s just with uhm ,  work and the stress of adoption ,  we just don &apos;t feel like we have the energy .  plus ,  we don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair that every year the burden falls on us .  
 that doesn &apos;t sound like you .  .  .  that &apos;s monica talking !  
no ,  no !  we made this decision together .  
she &apos;s putting words in your mouth !  
don &apos;t you put words in people &apos;s mouths ,  you put turkey in people &apos;s mouths !  
i can &apos;t believe this !  this is emma &apos;s first thanksgiving !  
no ,  it &apos;s not !

that &apos;s my favourite kind !  okay ,  we are doing this !  
don &apos;t let yourself get manipulated this way !  
hey ,  stay out of this ,  chandler !  this is between me .  .  .  and me !  
hey !  
hi !  happy thanksgiving !  
oh ,  yeah ,  happy needless - turkey - murder day .

you &apos;re not making the pies yourself ?  
no ,  no ,  no ,  i don &apos;t make chocolate pies .  when i was younger i - i enter in this pie - eating contest .  i ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick .  
did you at least win the contest ?  
2 minutes ,  12 pies and a part of one tin !  okay ,  i see you guys at 4 .  
can &apos;t wait !  
this dinner is gonna be so great !  in your face ,  last year  &quot; me &quot;  !   
hey rach .

well ,  let &apos;s see .  .  .  uh .  .  .  i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop .  why ?  
well ,  i wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant .  
oh my god !  that &apos;s the creepiest thing i &apos;ve ever heard !  
okay ,  but ,  well ,  before you say no ,  my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she &apos;s a real dog !  
oh !  phoebe ,  all babies are beautiful !  
 oh .  .  .  okay .  
phoebe ,  just the idea of pitting one baby against another ,  i mean ,  you know ,  and judging who &apos;s cuter just for a trophy .  .  .  
and a thousand dollars .  
 .  .  . is something i &apos;m very interested in !  oh please ,  do not tell ross .  he still believes that  what &apos;s in the inside is important .  .  .  
okay ,  oh ,  and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition .  
where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving ?  
well ,  i was thinking .  .  .  
oh ,  take the clothes of joey &apos;s cabbage patch kid .  
 did someone drop the baton again ?  
why come all the way from kansas to do that ?  
 i don &apos;t get older .  i just get better !  
you know what just occurred to me ?  this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us .  i mean ,  we could be getting a baby soon !  
you don &apos;t know that .  
somebody is gonna pick us .  
yeah ,  but we haven &apos;t heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks !  
i &apos;m telling ya !  it &apos;s gonna happen .  next year it &apos;s gonna be you ,  me and the little hemingway bing .   what ,  he &apos;s my favourite author !  
name one of his books .  
  &quot; the firm &quot;  ?  
ok ,  let &apos;s see .  .  .  uhm ,  okay ,  the turkey is in the oven ,  the stuffing is ready .  .  .  
you know ,  you always cook this meal all by yourself .  let me help this year .  
oh ,  chandler ,  that &apos;s sweet .  but you don &apos;t have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do .  
i &apos;m serious ,  let me do something ,  just not the turkey or the stuffing ,  nothing  &quot; high profile &quot;  .  
ok ,  let &apos;s see .  .  .  oh ,  the cranberry sauce ,  it is easy to make and no - one really cares about it .  
tell me more .  
okay ,  i &apos;m gonna go check on something across the hall .  you start by washing these  not with soap !  !   
you obviously haven &apos;t tasted my palmolive potatoes !   
hey !  hey ,  guess what joey has !  
three tickets to today &apos;s rangers game !  !

center ice .  
did i do something to you ?  
hmm ,  the game &apos;s at one .  
so ?  
dinner is at four ,  we &apos;ll never gonna make it back .  
so we &apos;ll leave before it &apos;s over ,  we &apos;ll be back in time .  
you say that now ,  but it could take us a long time to get back home .  plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up .  
dude ,  two times that happened !  
look ,  monica has been working hard all day ,  she didn &apos;t wanna host this thing in the first place ,  we shouldn &apos;t go !  
he &apos;s right ,  man .  
right ,  i guess .  alright ,  so see you at four .  
okay .   and get ready to taste my very special cranberries .  or should i say .  .  .  chanberries !

hey .  
oh phoebe ,  listen .  well ,  i think we gotta go .  this place is really freaking me out .  i &apos;ve been watching this guy over there ,  i don &apos;t think he came with a kid !  
we can &apos;t leave now !  there was this one baby ,  haley ,  who was favourite to win and she got croup ,  so she had to stay home !  this competition just blew wide open ,  folks !  
phoebe ,  i think .  .  .  it &apos;s just too weird ,  i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on !  
oh ,  i know ,  we should have been more prepared .   it &apos;s okay .  now ,  the way i see it ,  our real competition now is cameron .  oh my god ,  they just took her sweater off .  look at those arms !  hello michelin man .  
oh ,  phoebe !  come on !  you know what ,  it &apos;s already three o &apos;clock and they haven &apos;t even gotten to emma &apos;s group yet .  we gotta go ,  we got dinner !  
 but emma &apos;s got what it takes ,  she could go all the way !  
phoebe ,  you have to calm down .  
okay .  rachel ,  the hottest babies in the tri - state area are in this room right now !  i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma !  
really ?  
yeah !  
you heard them say that ?  
yeah !  
all right ,  okay .  alright ,  let &apos;s give to these babies something to cry about !  
good !  oh yay !  let &apos;s get down to business !  emma needs some makeup !  
no ,  what ?  
well ,  she &apos;s gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants !  
no phoebe ,  i am not letting you put makeup on my baby !  
why not !  
because i already did !  
 
oh ,  bob ,  get off the guy !  
oh !  what a game ,  huh ?

i can &apos;t believe they called ,  and we &apos;re actually getting a baby .   
oh ,  i know how you feel .  .  .   
really ?

we &apos;re just here to say goodbye ,  we &apos;re off to ohio .  
oh ,  right !  your adoption interview !  
yep ,  we &apos;re gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby .  
i can &apos;t believe it .  when you guys come back ,  you &apos;re gonna have a baby !  that is so weird !  
and so incorrect !  
she &apos;s only a couple of months pregnant .  she liked our application but who knows if she &apos;s gonna like us .  
come on ,  she &apos;s gonna love you guys !  
uhm ,  thank you ,  but we &apos;re really trying not to get our hopes up .  
and a lot could still get in our way .  
yeah .  i mean ,  this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better .  .  
what are you gonna name the baby ?  
i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word .  
but just think ,  ok ?  what if everything goes right ?  what if this woman does pick you guys ?  
oh my god .  she &apos;s gonna pick us !  
so we &apos;re standing firm on the  &apos;not getting our hopes up &apos; ?  
you know ,  i know that things could still go wrong but if they don &apos;t ?  if this works out ,  we &apos;re gonna have a baby chandler ,  a baby !  
yes ,  but .  .  .  
oh my god ,  it &apos;s gonna work !  we &apos;re gonna make it work !  i &apos;m gonna be a mummy and  you &apos;re gonna be a daddy !  all right ,  i &apos;ll see you suckers .  i &apos;m gonna get me .  .  .  a baby !

you &apos;re kidding me ?  i mean ,  it &apos;s enough that you are a doctor .  but on top of it ,  you &apos;re married to a reverend ?  
 i don &apos;t think that &apos;s exactly .  .  .

joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries .  .  .  
oh !  oh ,  no !   
what ?  you know about the plate thing ?  
oh ,  yeah .  joey doesnt share food .  i mean ,  just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and  .  .  .  
 you wouldnt let her have a grape ?  
oh no !  not me !  emma !   
 joey doesnt share food !  
well ,  i still think that its a stupid reason not to call someone again .  you are calling her !  and if you need to ,  just get an extra plate of fries for the table !  
 this place is awesome !  
you know ,  we should just go ,  im not gonna find anything here !  this stuff is ridiculous !   
ah ,  this place is great !  
wow !  
rach ,  come on ,  im not gonna wear any of this !   nothing silver .   .  ok ?  nothing with hair !   and nothing with padlocks on it !   .  
ross ,  look ,  i know that some of this stuff is out there ,  but i mean ,  come on ,  look at this ,  look at this sweater !   .  i mean ,  this is just beautiful !  
 wow ,  this is really soft  .  three hundred and fifty dollars ?  
yeah ,  down from seven hundred ,  you are saving like two hundred bucks !  
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today .  
 hey ,  check this out !  its totally you !  
wow !  
yeah !   
actually this looks like pretty good !  yeah !  boys will be boys ?  
what ?  they will be !  
all right ,  thats it ,  im getting out of here .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  ross ,  wait !  come on !  you know ,  theres other stuff .  heres a nice shirt ,  look at these nice pants .  .  .  
uh ,  actually these might look pretty good on me .  
yes ,  they will !  you know what you should do ?  just go take a walk ,  all right ?  i know your size and im .  .  .  im gonna pick up some really good stuff for you .  
really ?  
yes !  and i know what looks sexy on guys .  please ,  just wear what i suggest ,  and shes gonna go nuts for you .  
so ,  youre saying ,  uh ,  if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers ?  
yeah ,  i read some great applications ,  but then i thought who better then a minister to raise a child !  
amen .  
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor !  
reverend ,  can i ask ?  does the bible say anything about adoption ?  
wow .  
i was wondering you both have such serious jobs .   would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock ?  
 being a doctor must take up a lot of time .  
were great ,  i think i may have asked all my questions .  
yeah ,  actually .  so ,  you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us ?  were very proud of it .  
actually ,  i dont think we have to .  
yeah ,  when i read about you two ,  i was pretty sure i wanted you ,  but i just thought we should meet face to face .   .  i &apos;ve made my decision .  i choose them .  
oh my god ,  this is great !  this is so great !   .  did you hear that ?  
yeah ,  i did .  
we got some really great stuff !  
yeah ,  yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra &apos;s i got .  
oh !  really ?  do you wanna try some of them on for me ?  
oh !  okay .  wait ,  are we in joey &apos;s imagination ?  
 oh no !  i took one of ross &apos; bags by mistake ,  and one of mine is missing .  
 so ?  what do you think ?   
i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore !  !  
 yeah !  yeah !  rachel picked it out for me .  she told me to trust her and you know what ?  i &apos;m glad i did !  i turned quite a few heads on my way over here .  
 dude ,  i really don &apos;t think you should be wearing that .  
oh ,  i see ,  somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies ?  
 looks like someone is the ladies !  !  
we are not signing those papers .  
why not ?  
it &apos;s wrong .  they made a mistake .  they think we &apos;re somebody else .  
god works in mysterious ways .  
you have gotta stop !  
but she liked us .  
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica .  
well ,  if you think about it ,  i am kind of like a reverend .  i mean ,  as a chef ,  i serve god ,  by feeing the hungry and poor .   
your veal chop is $34 . 95 !  
c &apos;mon chandler ,  i think we have been given an opportunity .  i mean ,  the mistake has already been made .  they are writing up the paper right now .  
but we are not the one she chose !  how can you feel okay about this ?  
 because .  .  .  we may not be who she thinks we are but no - one will ever love that baby more than us .  
i know .  .  
i mean ,  who knows how long it &apos;s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ?  what if ,  what if no one ever picks us ?  
oh ,  honey .  .  
 please .  .  please ,  we are so close .  
monica ,  i want a baby too ,  but this woman is giving away her child .  she deserves to know who it &apos;s going to .  
 okay ,  right .   
so ,  we &apos;ll tell the truth and who knows ,  maybe she &apos;ll like us for us .  
 maybe she will .  uh !  why couldn &apos;t i have been a reverend ?  
you &apos;re jewish .  
a garden salad for the lady  
mmmh ,  those fries look delicious .  
 oh wow ,  are those stuffed clams ?  
uuuh .  .  yes ,  they are my stuffed clams .   
they are delicious  
oh ,  that is so sweet .  .  
oh  okay .  .    
what ?  what is the matter with you ?  
but you just said  &quot; what &apos;s mine is yours &quot;  ?  
fine ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i didn &apos;t think it was that big a deal .  
wow ,  this place looks great .  
me too !   
sure  just not as much as clams .  
chocolate torte for the lady ,  cheesecake for the gentleman .  
yes ,  that &apos;s raspberry coule .  
 oh my god !   
oh ,  no !  this is work .  i should call in .  can you excuse me ?  
what are you doing ?  i thought you don &apos;t share food .  
 no .  if i can &apos;t have your clams ,  you can &apos;t have my dessert .  this is a two way street .  
really !  now this all better be here when i come back .   
yeah ,  of course .  i can control myself .    
 stop staring at me !   
why ,  just a tiny little .  .  .   
oh - oh !  time lapse  
hi !  
hey .  an open adoption .  there &apos;s a lot to go over ,  but i &apos;ll explain everything as we go through it .  
yeah .  it &apos;s a sonogram they took of the baby last week .  i thought you might want to see it .   
look ,  doctor !   look ,  before we sign anything we really have to talk .  .  .  we &apos;re not who you think we are .

well ,  at least the perfume is not mine ,  be thankful for that !  
so ?  what do you think of the house ?  
its perfect .  its everything weve been looking for .  
isnt it ?  then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic ?  
and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps ?   what were the things you said ?  
dont you love the huge yard ?  
and the fireplace in the bedroom .  
and nancy said that it &apos;s really under price ,  because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents !  
this is bringing out a lovely color in you !  
so ?  do you think we should get it ?  
i dont know .  what do you think ?  
i think we should .  
i do too .  
this is huge !  
i know .  
how bad you wanna smoke ,  right now .  
i dont know what you mean ,  giant talking cigarette !  oh ,  by the way ,  phoebe called just as i was getting into nancys car ,  so if she asks you ,  i was at work all day .  
gotcha .  when do we tell them about this ?  
we dont .  not until it &apos;s a hundred percent .  i mean ,  why upset everybody over nothing .  
okay .  right .  oh my god that is gonna be so hard .  
i just cant see chandler cheating !  
im telling you guys ,  we followed them out to a house in westchester ,  the went in for like forty - five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy !  
chandler ?  forty - five minutes ?  well ,  something is not right .  i just cant believe he would do this to monica !  
i know ,  and with the baby coming ?  
so ,  should we tell her ?  
i dont know .  phoebe ,  if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you ?  
why ?  whod you seen him with ?  
no one ,  im just saying if .  .  .   
tell me what you know !  
 i know nothing !  mikes a great guy ,  it was hypothetical !  
all right .   .  he is a good guy .  youre right ,  he wouldnt cheat .  
oh ,  look at her ,  so happy !  
if only there were a smaller one to clean this one !  
hey ,  is uhm .  .  .  is chandler here ?  
no ,  hes picking up dinner ,  why ,  whats up ?  
well ,  look ,  whatever happens ,  were here for you and we love you .  
we think chandler might be having an affair .  
what ?  
phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester .  
they went in together .  so sorry .  
oh my god !  oh my god thats awful !  what did you think of the house ?   
what ?  
 monica ,  you understand what we are saying ,  right ?  
yeah ,  sure .  .  .  uhm ,  i &apos;m devastated ,  obviously .  .  .   did you think the neighborhood was homey ?   
hey !  
 you son of a bitch !  
is it me ,  or have the greetings gone downhill around here ?  
 phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and .  .  .  em .  .  .  they think you &apos;re having an affair .  
who &apos;s nancy ?  
what &apos;s going on ?  
 ok ,  alright ,  you guys ,  you &apos;d better sit down ,  this is pretty big .  
yeah  i &apos;m not having an affair .  nancy is our realtor .  
i knew he couldn &apos;t be with a woman for 45 minutes !  !  
why do you have a realtor ?  
uhm ,  she has been showing us houses outside of the city .  
 what ?  
are you serious ?  
when we found out that we &apos;re gonna get this baby ,  chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn &apos;t want to raise a kid in the city .  
so you &apos;re gonna move ?  
oh my god .  
shouldn &apos;t we all vote on stuff like this ?  !  
what is wrong with raising a kid in the city ?  i &apos;m doing it ,  ross is doing it ,  sarah jessica parker is doing it !  
and that &apos;s great for you guys ,  but we want a lawn and a swingset .  .  .  
 .  .  . and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice - cream truck can go by .  
 so you wanna buy a house in the 50 &apos;s ?  
have you thought about what you would be giving up ?  you can &apos;t move out of the city ,  what if you want chinese food at 5am ?  or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door ?  
you know what ,  if you wanna look for a house ,  that &apos;s okay .  
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s not ,  don &apos;t listen to him !   i &apos;m gonna thump you !   
 it &apos;s ok ,  because they have to get it out of their system ,  okay  ,  but you &apos;re going to realize ,  this is the only place ,  you wanna be .   
actually ,  we already found a house we love .  
what ?  
and about an hour ago ,  we made an offer .   
bet you wish i was having an affair now ,  huh ?  time lapse 
you put an offer on a house ?  
 it &apos;s so sweet .  it really is .  it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there &apos;s these old maple trees .  .  .   
wha .  .  ?  again with the nature ,  what are you ?  beavers ?  
i know this is really hard and we &apos;re really sorry .  
is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food ?   because i can stop doing that ,   i really ,  really think i can !  
 you know that &apos;s not the reason joe .   
we think if you saw it ,  you &apos;d understand .  i mean you guys were there .   it is beautiful ,  isn &apos;t it ?  
yeah it is .  
what the hell are you doin &apos; ?  
well ,  it is ,  all right ?  when we were out there is screwing this woman ,  but man this would be a nice place to live !  
yeah ,  but so is this .  
yeah ,  i mean ,  if you moved there ,  you have to leave here .  i mean ,  how can you leave this place ?

oh my god !  that &apos;s wild !  
yeah ,  but it was like a million years ago ,  so it doesn &apos;t matter .  
well ,  it matters to me .  
why ?  
because .  .  .  the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time .  
you kissed her that night too ?  
two guys in one night ?  wow ,  i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed .  
seriously ,  where did this happen ?  
okay ,  after you told me she was passed out in our room ,  i went in there to make sure she was all right .  she was lying on my bed ,  all buried in peoples &apos; coats .  well ,  i went to kiss her on the forehead ,  you know .  but it was so dark ,  i accidentally got her lips .  i started to pull away ,  but then i felt her start to kiss me back .  it was only for a second ,  but .  .  .  it was amazing .  and now ,  now i find out that you kissed her first .  
oh wait .  .  .  what bed did you say she was on ?  
mine .  
i &apos;m pretty sure i put her on my bed .  
no ,  she was definitely on my bed .  
why would i kiss a girl ,  and then put her on your bed ?  
well ,  then who was on my bed ?  
 oh !  oh ,  oh !   
 no !  no ,  no !  
yes !   
you were under the pile of coats ?

so he can &apos;t come ?  
no ,  and so there &apos;s no one to walk me down the aisle and .  .  .  well ,  i would just really love it if you would do it .

what harpist ?  my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums .  
ooh .  .  .  she backed out .  
she did ?  why ?  
i made her .   steel drums don &apos;t really say  &quot; elegant wedding &quot;  .  nor does marjorie &apos;s overwhelming scent .  
hey !

 you know what i just realized ?  we have no idea what we &apos;re doing in the wedding tomorrow .

i know ,  i hate being left out of things .  
hey guys ,  how is it going ?

strike three !  you only get one more ,  mike !   
so ,  what did you decide ?  
i decided to pee .  
mike didn &apos;t tell you ?  you have to choose one of us to be in your wedding .  one of his groomsmen fell out .  
oh no ,  no .  i can &apos;t choose between you two !  i love you both so much !

oh ,  man !  i wouldn &apos;t have had breakfast if i knew there was going to be corsages !   
hi .  about last night .  .  .  i know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit .  .  .  my point is ,  uh ,  well ,  i &apos;m willing to take my job back .  
oh ,  well that &apos;s ok .  i think you and i will do much better if you &apos;re just .  .  .  here as a bridesmaid .  
oh ,  is that so ?  ok .  if that &apos;s really what you want ,  then here .  .  .  i give you the headset .  well ,  i don &apos;t really want to give you the headset .  well i guess if you &apos;re taking over ,  you should probably return these messages .   
wow ,  this is a lot !  
uh - huh ,  but i &apos;m sure you can handle this .  i mean ,  i have won awards for my organizational skills ,  but ,  uh ,  i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll do fine .  
you won awards ?  
mm - mh .  i printed them out on my computer .   
hey !

what d &apos;you want ?  
you haven &apos;t by any chance chosen a groomsman yet ,  have you ?  
oh ,  ross ,  c &apos;mon ,  please !  don &apos;t make this harder than it already is !

well ,  chandler said that it &apos;s really important to him too !  
listen ,  listen .  whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you !  now ,  i promise i won &apos;t say a word ,  but if you pick chandler he &apos;s gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time !  
oh ,  you are the lesser of two evils !  
sven i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying !  what is wrong with the flowers ?  lorkins ?  what the hell are lorkins ?

joey ,  i kinda have a lot to do today ,  what do you want ?  
 joe ,  i love phoebe .  she &apos;s the single most important thing in my life .  i &apos;d die before i let anything happen to her .  
that must have been one lousy movie .  
hi 
hey ,  can i talk to you about this groomsman thing ?  if you pick ross ,  he &apos;ll walk you down the isle just fine .  but if you choose me ,  you &apos;ll be getting some comedy !  
even so ,  i think i &apos;m gonna pick ross .  
let me tell you why you need to pick me .   see ,  when i was a kid ,  i was always left out of everything ,  you know ,  and it really made me feel .  .  .  insecure .  you know ,  i was always picked last in gym .  even behind that big fat exchange student who didn &apos;t even know the rules to baseball .  i mean ,  this guy would strike out and then run to third .  anyway ,  if i &apos;m the only one left out of this wedding ,  i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back .  
all right fine ,  i pick you .  
 y - y - yeeesss !  make  &quot; groom &quot;  for chandler .  
no !  we &apos;re gonna do it my way .   because your way is stupid !  alright i gotta go ,  i have another call ,  reverend .   hello ?

okay .  
uhm ,  did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall ?  
oh my god ,  what &apos;s it doing here ?

 oh my god ,  everything is such a mess .  why is this happening to me ?  
how &apos;s it going ?

i &apos;ll tell you at the wedding .  
hey ,  i forgot my scarf .

what ?  a dog ?  no !  rachel gets to choose .   
 wow ,  this is a tough one .  i think i &apos;m gonna have to go with the dog .

mhm - mh !  
thanks so much for taking me to all those places .  i had a great time .

 new york is awesome !  
what is with you ?  
yeah ,  i &apos;ve been to these places before ,  but i &apos;ve never really seen them ,  you know .  
thanks so much for showing me around .  
well ,  if there is anything else you wanna know .  .  .   
oh ,  sure .  yeah ,  well ,  he was my high school boyfriend .  captain of the football team ,  really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college .   
yeah .  .  .  it &apos;s almost definitely him .   
well ,  there is a chance it &apos;s another guy .  i mean ,  i have only ever been with two guys ,  but they sorta overlapped .  
no ,  he &apos;s in prison .   
no .  .  .  he killed his father with a shovel .   but other than that ,  he &apos;s a great guy .  
i &apos;ll bet his dad doesn &apos;t think so .   
are you awake ?  
of course i &apos;m awake .  assume from now on that i &apos;m always awake !   
alright ,  we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s him .  i mean ,  it could be the football guy .  
honey ,  it &apos;s us .  of course it &apos;s the shovel - killer .  
alright ,  lets say that it is him ,  would we not want the baby ?  no !  would we treat him any differently ?  
i &apos;d keep an eye on him !  we have to find out which one the father is .  
how ?  
i dunno ,  aren &apos;t there tests for these things ,  right ?  
yeah ,  but maybe we &apos;re just over - reacting .  
we will now count from one to five .  un ,  deux ,  trois ,  quatre ,  cinq .  
good job .  
thank you .   
hey joey .  
hey !  
listen ,  i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought about it a lot and ,  and i know ,  i was too impatient .  so lets try it again .  
oh ,  no ,  that &apos;s okay ,  i don &apos;t need your help .  i worked on it myself and i gotta say ,  i am pretty good !  
really ,  can i hear some of it .  
sure ,  sure .  ok ,    &quot; bleu de la bleu ,  de la blu bla bleu &quot;   see ?  
well ,  you &apos;re not ,   you &apos;re not .  .  .  you &apos;re not .  .  .  again ,  you &apos;re not speaking french !  
 oh well i think i am ,  yeah and i think i &apos;m definitely gonna get the part .  
how could you possibly think that ?  
hey rach ,  can you grab me a cup of coffee ?  
 sure .   
you &apos;ve been quiet all morning .  is everything okay ?  
hmm - hmm .   
you sure you &apos;re alright ?  
 yep .  
 o - kay .  well ,  i &apos;m gonna go grab us some breakfast .   
fyi .  .  
 there it is .  .  .   
in the future ,  when a girl asks for some ill - advised sympathy sex .  .  .  just do it .   
 wait ,  wait ,   you &apos;re mad at me about last night ?  i was just trying to do the right thing .  
 really ?  well ,  it seems to me if you &apos;d done the right thing ,  i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed ,  i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied !  
 well .  .  .  
oh stop that !  
i can &apos;t believe this .  i was just being a good guy .  i treated you with respect and understanding .  
hey ,  i was looking out for you .  
oh ,  really ,  well ross ,  you know what ?  i am a big girl .  i don &apos;t need someone telling me what is best for me .  
i gotta say ,  i have not had sex a lot of times before ,  this is the worst ever .  
oh ,  really ,  really ?  well ,  it wasn &apos;t very good for me either .   
hey you know what ?  you know what ?  to avoid this little thing in the future ,  let &apos;s just say ,  you and me ,  never having sex again .  
what ?  
 we had a good time .  by the way ,  i wanted to ask you something .  it would really mean a lot to me ,  if the baby was a boy ,  that you name him after my father ,  jiminy billy bob  
no !   you we &apos;re right ,  that was fun !  i &apos;m gonna go finish packing .  
o - okay .   so ,  is she gonna take the test ?  
nope ,  she doesn &apos;t have to ,  i found out who the father is .  
oh god .  it &apos;s shovely - joe ,  isn &apos;t it ?  
 no it &apos;s not .  
well ,  it turns out that erica didn &apos;t pay much attention in sex ed class ,  because the thing she did with that prison guy .  .  .  it &apos;d be pretty hard to make a baby that way .  
oh god !  what was it ?  the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do ?  
the thing we never do .  
whenever you &apos;re ready joey .  
right .   dja bu bu claude .  uh ,  c &apos;est la pu les la lu blah bloo .  
joey ,  do you speak french ?  
you know what .  i think this audition is over .   
you really think this man is speaking french ?  
sa - sa - saw !  
listen ,  i will tell you the truth .  he &apos;s my little bother .  he &apos;s a bit retarded .  
good job ,  little buddy .  that was some really good french .  but i think we &apos;re gonna go with someone else for the part .  
it was great .  
 oh - hoh !  ha - hah !  see !  
thanks ,  goodbye 
yeah - hah .  toute - de - le - fruit .  
emma &apos;s down for the night .  
oh ,  good .  
so uh .  .  .  i guess i wanna take off .  
okay .  .  .  hey listen ,  just before you go i - i again ,  i just wanna say  &quot; thank you &quot;  for coming with me .  
oh ,  no problem .  
and also ,  you know i uh ,  i was thinking about what you said ,  you know ,  about the whole sex thing and .  .  .  it &apos;s probably not a great idea to go down that road again .  
thank you .  i &apos;m glad you agree .  
it &apos;s a shame though ,  i mean ,  when we did it ,  it was pretty good .  
yeah .  .  .  yeah ,  that &apos;s true .  
hey uhm ,  do you remember that one really great time .  .  .  ?  
oh ,  ye - ah !  
you know it was you &apos;re uhm .  .  .  birthday .  .  .

hmmm - mmmm .  
 not even one more time ?  
not even once .  
no matter how much we want it .  
even if we want it really bad .  
that &apos;s what we decided .  
uhm ,  right !  
 .  .  . it &apos;s kinda hard though !  
yeah .  
you know ,  when two people have a connection ,  you know ,  that &apos;s .  .  .  just seems like such a .  .  .  waste .  
 .  .  . i hate waste .

well ,  i didn &apos;t get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren .  
that is a bad interview .  
what are you ,  what are you talking about ?  how did this happen ?  
well ,  my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview and he heard everything .  so later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he &apos;s gonna have to let me go ,  because i &apos;m not a team player .  and i said  &quot; wait a minute !  yes i am .  &quot;  and i had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact .  .  .  was true .  
oh god .  i &apos;m so sorry .   
hey !  wha - hoo !  what &apos;s this ?   well it &apos;s a ,  it &apos;s a bottle of champagne .  why is this here ?

no it &apos;s not .  we had an inspection and they didn &apos;t find anything .

maybe .  so this is the living room huh ?  ooh ,  it &apos;s pretty dark .   
no it &apos;s not !

when your head was hanging out the window ,  it didn &apos;t hit a mailbox ,  did it ?

joey ,  there was a little girl who lived here ,  but she died like 30 years ago .   
 what ?  
ha !  i &apos;m just messing with you .  
that &apos;s not funny !  you know i &apos;m afraid of little girl ghosts !  
joey ,  now that you &apos;re okay with the house ,  do you wanna go see your room ?

it &apos;s seven years ago .   my time machine works !  
we ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her .  but i know he just wants to get into her pants .  
so what if he wants to sleep with her ?  i mean ,  she &apos;s single and he &apos;s cute .  
excuse me ?  
oh please !  yesterday on the subway ?  you couldn &apos;t stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time .

the job is in paris .   fade out 
oh ,  god !  please ,  somebody say something .  
so if you take this job you &apos;ll be moving to paris ?  
or facing a bitch of a commute .  
i know ,  it &apos;s huge ,  and it &apos;s scary ,  and it &apos;s .  .  .  really far ,  far away from you guys ,  but this is such an incredible opportunity for me .  and i &apos;ve already talked to them about our situation with emma ,  and they said they &apos;ll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable .  
okay .  
i mean ,  i &apos;ll fly back and forth ,  they &apos;ll fly you out .  .  .  anything we want .  
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle .

well ,  it comes and goes .  i wouldn &apos;t trust it .  
look ,  you guys .  .  .  this is really ,  really important to me .  and it means a lot if you could try to get on board .  
of course we can .  congratulations .   yay !   joey .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no .  my hugs are reserved for people staying in america .  
 joey ,  it would mean so .  .  .  
hey !  no !  get your france - going - arms away from me .   
joey .  .  .  
you okay with this ?  
well ,  it makes me feel sad ,  but .  .  .  
talking to ross .  
i see .  
well ,  rachel moving to another country ?  not being able to see her every day .  how can i be okay with this ?  
i know ,  but what are we gonna do ?  she really needs this job .  
do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back ,  she would take it ?  
how is that gonna happen ?  
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i could talk to her boss .  yeah !  i met him at that christmas party .  we really hit it off .  
you mean the guy who kept calling you ron ?  
hey phoebe .  hey ,  tell me what you think .  all right .  the house next door to the one that we &apos;re buying in westchester ?  just went on the market .  i wanna take a look at it ,  but chandler doesn &apos;t .  
we close escrow tomorrow ,  so seeing another house can only confuse us ,  and we &apos;re easily confused .  we &apos;re not very bright .  
but what if it is better than ours ?  should we at least look ?  
what do you think pheebs ?  
well ,  i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins .  .  .  anyway .  .  .  hey ,  isn &apos;t joey &apos;s agent estelle leonard ?  
yeah .  
she died .  
you &apos;re kidding !  
that &apos;s terrible !  
yeah ,  last saturday .  wow !  she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic .   oh ,  wait a minute ,  i read the wrong one .  
oh yeah ?  
yeah ,  she was just an agent .  
joey &apos;s gonna be *so* upset .  
i know .  *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic .  
well ,  we cannot tell joey about this .  he &apos;s already flipping out about everything that &apos;s changing .  this will push him over the edge .  
seriously ,  you don &apos;t think we should tell him ?  
well ,  not for a little while .  let &apos;s just give him a few days to get used to everything else .  
what if he reads it in the paper ?  
may i help you ?  
oh right ,  uhm ,  don ?  
uh .  .  .  what can i do for you ?  
ah ,  did she ask you to come here and do this ?  
wow ,  that is tempting .  
she is good !  
but i &apos;m sorry .  there &apos;s nothing i can do .  .  .  ah ,  it &apos;s not true ,  there is .  .  .  nothing i want to do .  
yeah ,  his name is ross .   what ?  
yeah ,  they &apos;re all he talks about ,  why ?  
you can really arrange that ?  
well ,  i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing in the world .  
thats great .  i worry about little ross .  hes always reading ,  he &apos;s collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs .  
hey phoebe .  
hey .  everything ok ?  
im just mad at my agent .  
estelle ?  why ?  
theres a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didnt even be put up for it !  shed better have a good reason .  
im guessing she does .  
well  im wanna hear it ,  because she keeps doing this .  
well ,  no ,  no ,  wait ,  wait ,  wait .  all right ,  i gotta go .  just listen .  promise me ,  that you will wait a minute before you call her .  
ok .  why ?  
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason .   
i love that saying !   .  
hello ?  
its a little coincidental ,  but believable .   .  listen ,  im sure youre wondering why i didnt get you an audition for that tv movie .  
i guess i dropped the ball there .  whoopsie !  
dont take that tone with me .  who you think you are ?  alan lemond ,  the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic ?  
what are you saying ?  
im saying that  .  this isn &apos;t working for me anymore ,  ok ?  estelle ,  youre fired .  goodbye .   .  
hi .  
hi .  
emma left her stuffed t - rex at my house .  you know she cant sleep without it .  
oh ,  well ,  shes asleep now .  stop forcing that thing on her .  
ok .  
oh ,  youre not gonna believe what happened to me today !  ralph lauren called ,  and gave me my job back !  
nooo !  
yee .  i mean ,  it was so weirdest thing .  they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back !  i mean ,  that place must have been falling apart without me .  
so ,  youre not going to paris .  
no ,  im still going .  
wh whwhat ?  
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back ,  the offered me more money !  isnt that great ?  
oh ,  sure .  im showing it to someone else right now ,  but please ,  look around .  
thanks .  
it feels like were cheating on our house .  and if were gonna cheat ,  shouldnt it be with like a hot ,  younger house ,  that does stuff that our house wont do ?  
so ?  what do you think ?  
well ,  we already have one offer on it ,  and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one .  
hey joey ,  want come with me to are you ok ?  
yeah ,  i just i just feel bad about firing estelle .  this is got to be killing her .  
no ,  that wouldnt kill her .  ordinary embolism might .  
i dont know .  shes got to be taking it hard ,  i was like her only client .  except for this guy who eats paper .  and im guessing he eats more money than he makes .  look ,  i know shes not a great agent ,  but she did stick with me for ten years .  im gonna call her and hire her again .  
no ,  no ,  no !  don &apos;t call her !  you wait for her to call you  
why ?  
because patience is the road to understanding  which  .  .  .  is the key .  .  .  to a happy heart .  
 you blow me away .  
 all right ,  so promise you &apos;re gonna wait for her to call you ?  
what a small world !  
oh ,  we go way back .  before monica made an honest man out of him ,  chandler used to be my little love muffin !   .  so ?  are you guys thinking of getting this house too ?  ooh !  are we gonna have a bidding war ?  i &apos;d better warn you ,  i &apos;m a toughie  
 don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t !   
no ,  actually ,  we &apos;re buying the house next door .   
 why !  ?  
ooh ,  that decides it then .  i was on the fence .  but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ?  ah !  now we have to get it !   ellen ,  we &apos;re going to talk numbers .   
this can not be happening !  
okay ,  the realtor said another couple made an offer .  maybe the janice &apos;s won &apos;t get it !  maybe the other couple will .  
the only way that that is going to happen ,  is if the other couple are the hitlers .  
 okay ,  okay ,   all right .  what if we got both houses ?  huh ?  we can turn this house into a guest house .  
that is a great idea !  and by the way ,  i don &apos;t mean to sound distasteful ,  but when did you start crapping money !  ?  
okay ,  you come up with an idea .  
alright alright ,  we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house .  we can still get out .  
but we love our house .  
will we love it so much with her next door ?  and she &apos;s gonna be louder out here too .  just the crickets and   &quot; oh my god &quot;  !  
okay ,  but if we don &apos;t get this house ,  she &apos;s stil gonna show up wherever we go !  i mean ,  at least if she &apos;s here ,  it eliminates the element of suprise .  i mean ,  never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body .   
this may surprise you ,  but re - hiring fired employees ,  is not my main job .  
 not good ,  ron .  
 wow ,  that &apos;s pretty cool  
okay ,  you got it .  
this is gonna make me very popular .  
 i meant with my son .  
joey ,  this is al t .  booker ,   the guy who eats paper .  i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard that estelle passed away .   i wanted to let you know there &apos;s a memorial for her at the westside chapel ,  tomorrow at ten .  hope you can make it .  
oh my god .   hello ?  
 joey ,  it &apos;s estelle .   
estelle ?  
yeah ,  i wanted to call and tell you that there &apos;s no hard feelings for firing me .  
 ok - ay .  i just ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re calling me ?  
well ,  i didn &apos;t think i should just drop by .  .  .  
no ,  no ,  no !   don &apos;t drop by ,  don &apos;t drop by !  
anyway ,  you did what you had to do .  i &apos;m okay .  
can i ask you something ?  uhm ,  what &apos;s it like there ?  
 it &apos;s alright .  look kiddo ,  i gotta go .  good luck with the career .  you &apos;re gonna be huge .  
well .  .  .  i just talked to sid ,  we are definitely putting in an offer on the house .  .  .  a - a - and i &apos;ll bet we get it .  
all right ,  i got to run .  tell monica i say goodbye .  and .  .  .  i &apos;ll see you later ,  neighbor .   
oh ,  me too .  .  .   
huh ?  
oh .  .  .  my .  .  .  
chandler ,  what are you talking about ?  
i don &apos;t know what to say .  .  .  i mean ,  you know ,  obviously we have this .  .  .  heat between us .  
but i love my husband .  and i know you love your wife .  now ,  i don &apos;t think we should get this house now .  
chandler ,  one of us has got to be strong .  
although ,  maybe just .  .  .  one last moment of weakness .  .  .   goodbye chandler bing .   
hi !  
hey !  
you are never going to believe what happened to me today .  
what ?  
ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money .  
they did ?  
yeah .  it was the weirdest thing .  zelner called me and he said we &apos;ll do everything we can to get you back .  and that i should thank some ron .  .  .  i don &apos;t even know what department that guy &apos;s in .  
so ,  what are you gonna do ?  
well ,  i took it .  
yay !  whoo !  yay !

uhm ,  i hadn &apos;t no you .  .  .  i had no idea you were so excited about paris .  uhm ,  i mean ,  you said you were scared .  
well yeah ,  but i mean ,  it was good scared though ,  you know ?  like when i - moved - to - new - york scared .  or uhm ,  when i - found - out - i - was - gonna - have - emma scared .  .  .  but this is .  .  .  fine .  this is gonna be good .   
 you should go .  
what ?  
it &apos;s what you want .  you should go .  
you really think so ?  
i really do .  
but i already told zelner that i would come back .  .  .  
 i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll understand .  
all right .  all right !  i &apos;m gonna do it .  i &apos;m gonna go to paris .  
yeah .  .  .

chandler ?  i was just in our bedroom and i found these  on my pillow .  
oh ,  yes .  i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play !

i know what you mean .  you &apos;re like a sister to me too .  
 i wouldn &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do without you .  .  .  
 you &apos;re the best friend i ever had .

i .  .  .  i .  .  .  i .  .  .   
 oh no ,  she took down monica .  .  .  and i &apos;m the crier in the family .  oh god !  i could be next .  maybe she won &apos;t talk with me if it looks like we &apos;re deep in converstation .  oh ,  so that thing you said about the thing .  it really made me think about that other thing .  
uh ,  rach ?  
well it &apos;s okay .  chandler is talking to her .  
i really made you think about that thing uh ?  
 uh ,  rach .  .  .  i think i have something that belongs to you .   
 oh ,  i &apos;m sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don &apos;t get .  
no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  they &apos;re really yours .  we .  .  .  found them in your old room .  
well ,  these aren &apos;t mine .  maybe monica used to use them with .  .  .  
don &apos;t say richard !  well ,  if they &apos;re not monica &apos;s and they &apos;re not yours ,  then whose are they ?  
well ,  i think you &apos;re forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room .  
pheebs !

i think these are yours .  
these are not mine .  .  .  look how flimsy they are ,  come on !  good god !  you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these ,  they &apos;ll snap like a piece of licorice .  
 can i talk to you alone for a minute ?  
sure .   you don &apos;t really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you ?  
oh honey .  .  .  
let me just say something .  .  .  because once we get into this ,  i &apos;m gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke .  .  .  i just want to say that i .  .  .  i love you .  .  .  and ,  i &apos;m gonna miss you .  and i &apos;m so sad that you &apos;re leaving .  
 oh ,  you know what ?  let &apos;s not say anything else .  i love you .

 so ,  i guess you &apos;re next .  you &apos;re ready ?  
i don &apos;t think so .  
oh ,  you &apos;re definately not .  i haven &apos;t cried like that in years .  
you cried yesterday at the six o &apos;clock news .  
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic .  
god !  i can &apos;t believe she saved me for last .   why are they taking so long ?  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !   
okay ,  here we go .  .  .  
oh .  .  .   well .  .  .  
yeah .  .  .  
i think i &apos;m gonna take off .   
huh ?  
oh ,  you guys .  this was an amazing night .  thank you so much .  i love you .  good night .   
what ?  i don &apos;t get a goodbye ?  
unbelievable .  she says goodbye to everyone but me .  
well ,  maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be ,  you know ,  implicit .  
well ,  it needs to be plicit .  
all right ,  let &apos;s think about this .  i mean ,  there &apos;s got to be an explanation .  uh .  .  .  did you do anything to make her mad ?  
no ,  i don &apos;t think so .  
you know ,  maybe she was just really spent from our talk .  it was pretty intense .  
yeah .  mine too .  
mine was a humdinger 
 o - kay .  .  .  i mean ,  don &apos;t i deserve anything ?  i mean ,  a few tears ,  a cursory hug ?   not from you !   
ross ,  if you &apos;re this upset ,  you should go and talk to her .  
and say what ?   &quot; you owe me a goodbye &quot;  ,  i mean ,  he &apos;s got more pride than that .  
the hell i do !   
i don &apos;t get a goodbye ?  
what ?  
 everyone gets a goodbye but me ?  what have i got to do to get a goodbye ,  huh ?  be best friends with you ?  uh ,  go out with you ?  have a baby with you ?  oh wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  i did all those things .  
ross .  .  .  
i hope ross isn &apos;t too upset .  
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s not more bummed out than i am .  
tell me about it .  
well ,  you can &apos;t say we don &apos;t know how to throw a party .  
all right ,  i think i &apos;m gonna head out .  
uh ,  where do you think you &apos;re going ?  
i thought i was going home to go to bed ,  but i &apos;m sensing there &apos;s something less fun for me to do here .  
we &apos;re moving in a couple of days and we &apos;ve got a lot of packing to do .  it would be great if you guys could pitch in .  
joey and i can finish up in the guest room .  
oh ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  good idea .   
oh no !  you and phoebe are gonna help me in here .  
 you couldn &apos;t be cool .   
okay ,  we &apos;re gonna start in the kitchen .  plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box .  the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped .  got it ?  
good !  now i need you to be careful and efficient .  and remember ,  if i am harsh with you ,  it is only because you are doing it wrong .  
hey mon ,  i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are .  
you did ?  how ?  
well ,  i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them .  .  .  being used .  
oh my god !  let me see .   
who &apos;s that dirty old lady ?  
monica &apos;s grandmother .  
hey !  
come on here ,  have a seat .  
oh ,  it was okay .  i went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner .  we went to this place that had .  .  .  ooh .  .  .   hoo .  .  .  ooh .  .  .  anyway ,  they had these really amazing cheeseburgers .  
yeah ,  you know ,  maybe i ate too much .  i keep getting these stomach aches .  they come and go like every few minutes .  
oh my god !  
relax !  we just get her some antacids .  
she doesn &apos;t have a stomach ache ,  she &apos;s in labor .  
oh my god !  
yeah ,  you got to get to the hospital .  
all right ,  chandler get the coats .  erica let &apos;s go .  phoebe and joey ,  keep packing !  oh my god we &apos;re gonna have a baby .  all right .  we &apos;re gonna have a baby !  oh my god ,  we &apos;re gonna have a baby !  oh god ,  oh god ,  i got to sit down ,  i got to sit down .  ooh !   
you can do this .  just breathe .  
 ooh !  are you sure ?  
oh .  .  .  yes ,  i &apos;m sure .  oh honey ,  let &apos;s go .  okay bye everyone .   
chandler ,  wait ,  wait ,  wait .  .  .  
what ?  
you really think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because i don &apos;t care ?  
that &apos;s what it seemed like .  
i cannot believe that after ten years ,  you do not know one thing about me .  
fine ,  then why didn &apos;t you say something ?  
because it is too damn hard ross .  i can &apos;t even begin to explain to you how much i &apos;m gonna miss you .  when i think about not seeing you every day ,  it makes me not want to go .  .  .  okay ,  so if you think that i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else ,  you &apos;re wrong .  it &apos;s because you mean more to me .  so there ,  all right ,  there &apos;s your goodbye .  .  .  oh !  
rach !  
what ?  
you keep ,  you keep .  .  .  you can &apos;t .  .  .  
a little more .  
okay .   
a little more ,  a little more .   a little more .  .  .  all right .  okay ,  all right ,  let &apos;s do this .  
all right ,  ready ?  
yeah .  all right ,  now give me your best shot .  
all right ,  here it goes .  .  .   
 doesn &apos;t work .  .  .    
yeah ,  you know ,  maybe i ate too much .  i keep getting these stomach - aches .  they come and go like every few minutes .  
oh my god !  
relax !  we &apos;ll just get her some antacids .  
she doesn &apos;t have a stomach - ache .  she &apos;s in labor !  
oh my god !   
so if you think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else ,  you &apos;re wrong .  it &apos;s because you mean more to me .  
rach !  
hey .

oh .  this was amazing .

no ,  i &apos;m okay .  
alright ,  i &apos;ll be right back .  
where are you going ?  
to use the bathroom .  
you can &apos;t leave me alone with her .  
what ?  
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with !  
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with ?  
it &apos;s just that we &apos;ve never spent any time ,  you know ,  alone together .  
you &apos;ll be fine .  nah ,  you won &apos;t ,  but i &apos;ll be back in two minutes .  
okay .   
i don &apos;t know .  maybe church - camp ?  
what ?  
well ,  it &apos;s just interesting .  you know ,  because no one will ever know ,  because no one can experience both .   
morning .

it &apos;s my house - warming present for monica and chandler .  
it &apos;s a baby chick and duck !  
uh - huh .  and i named them chick jr .  and duck jr .  
i did not see that coming .  
yeah ,  i figure they &apos;ll love it at the new house ,  you know ?  it has that big backyard .  and then ,  when they get old ,  they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to .  
yes .  
yeah .  it &apos;s a shame people can &apos;t visit there .  
that is the rule ,  though .   
guess what ?  you &apos;re almost an uncle !  
what ?

oh my god .  you and rachel ?  
i know ,  it &apos;s pretty great .  
so what does that mean ?  are you guys getting back together ?  
oh ,  i .  .  i don &apos;t know .  we didn &apos;t really get to talk .  
but do you wanna get back together ?  
i don &apos;t know .  it was incredible .  i mean ,  it just felt so right .  when i was holding her ,  i mean ,  i never wanted to let her go .  you know what ?  yeah ,  i do .  i wanna be together .

you know it &apos;s twins ,  right ?  
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t know it &apos;s twins !  this has never happened before .  
well ,  gosh .  that makes me feel so special and good .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio .  
i don &apos;t think so .  although ,  they did mention something about two heartbeats .  but i thought that was just mine and the baby &apos;s .  they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong ,  and i thought well ,  that &apos;s good  &apos;cause i &apos;m having a baby .  
twins actually run in my family .  
interesting !   can i see you for a second ?   
what do we do ?  
what do you mean  &quot; what do we do &quot;  ?  
 twins !  twins !  !  
chandler ,  you &apos;re panicking !  
uh - huh !  join me ,  won &apos;t you ?  !  okay ,  what do you say we keep one ,  and then just like have an option on the other one ?  
we can &apos;t split them up !  
why not ?  we could give each of them half a medallion ,  and then years later ,  they &apos;ll find each other and be reunited .  i mean ,  that &apos;s a great day for everybody .  
okay ,  what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible ?  
what if they &apos;re not ?  what if it &apos;s adopted by a king ?  
yeah ,  because i hear the king is looking to adopt .  
monica ,  we are not ready to have two babies !  
that doesn &apos;t matter !  we have waited so long for this .  i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s two babies .  i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s three babies !  i don &apos;t care if the entire cast of  &quot; eight is enough &quot;  comes out of there !  we are taking them home ,  because they are our children !  
 okay .  shhh .  .  .   
okay .  
okay !  
here she comes !  
yeah .  
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye .  
oh my god !  what did you say ?  
nothing !  what do you say to that ?  
ross ,  you &apos;ve got to tell her how you feel !  
no way !  
you can &apos;t just give up !  is that what a dinosaur would do ?  
what ?  
dude ,  i &apos;m just trying to speak your language .  
ross ,  rachel doesn &apos;t know that you wanna get back together .  if she did ,  she might feel differently .  she might not even go .  
you really think so ?  
i &apos;m telling you !  oh ,  okay !  this is the part of the musical where there &apos;d be a really good convincing song .    &quot; bam - bam ,  don &apos;t take no for an answer .  bam - bam ,  don &apos;t let love fly away .  bam - bam - bam - bam .  .  .  &quot;

alright ,  look ,  i have to go .  i love you ,  and i will call you the minute i get to paris .

if that falls off the truck ,  it wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing .   
wow .  
i know .  it seems smaller somehow .  
has it always been purple ?  
 look around ,  you guys .  this was your first home .  and it was a happy place ,  filled with love and laughter .  but more important ,  because of rent control ,  it was a friggin &apos; steal !   
hey ,  do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment ?  
oh ,  yeah ,  that &apos;s true .  
uh ,  i haven &apos;t .  
wait a minute .  what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma ,  and you tried to make it as a dancer ?  
do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up ?  
oh ,  honey ,  i forgot .  i promised treeger that we &apos;d leave our keys .  
oh ,  okay .   
so ,  i guess this is it .  
yeah .  i guess so .  
 this is harder than i thought it would be .  
oh ,  it &apos;s gonna be okay .

we got some time .  
okay ,  should we get some coffee ?

yeah ,  you know ,  maybe i ate too much .  i keep getting these stomach - aches .  they come and go like every few minutes .  
oh my god !  
relax !  we &apos;ll just get her some antacids .  
she doesn &apos;t have a stomach - ache .  she &apos;s in labor !  
oh my god !   
so if you think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else ,  you &apos;re wrong .  it &apos;s because you mean more to me .  
rach !

you can &apos;t leave me alone with her .  
what ?  
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with !  
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with ?  
it &apos;s just that we &apos;ve never spent any time ,  you know ,  alone together .  
you &apos;ll be fine .  nah ,  you won &apos;t ,  but i &apos;ll be back in two minutes .  
okay .

it &apos;s a baby chick and duck !  
uh - huh .  and i named them chick jr .  and duck jr .  
i did not see that coming .

oh ,  you did it !  
would you like to cut the umbilical cord ?   
well ,  that &apos;s spongy .  
 oh ,  hey handsome !  oh ,  i &apos;m gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you !   oh ,  we are so lucky !  
i know .  he has your eyes .   
we &apos;ll just get him cleaned up a bit .   
okay .  
i &apos;m really happy for you guys .  
well ,  you don &apos;t have that much time to relax .  the other one will be along in a minute .   
the next baby should be along in a minute .  
you know it &apos;s twins ,  right ?  
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t know it &apos;s twins !  this has never happened before .  
well ,  gosh .  that makes me feel so special and good .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio .  
i don &apos;t think so .  although ,  they did mention something about two heartbeats .  but i thought that was just mine and the baby &apos;s .  they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong ,  and i thought well ,  that &apos;s good  &apos;cause i &apos;m having a baby .  
twins actually run in my family .  
interesting !   can i see you for a second ?   
what do we do ?  
what do you mean  &quot; what do we do &quot;  ?  
 twins !  twins !  !  
chandler ,  you &apos;re panicking !  
uh - huh !  join me ,  won &apos;t you ?  !  okay ,  what do you say we keep one ,  and then just like have an option on the other one ?  
we can &apos;t split them up !  
why not ?  we could give each of them half a medallion ,  and then years later ,  they &apos;ll find each other and be reunited .  i mean ,  that &apos;s a great day for everybody .  
okay ,  what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible ?  
what if they &apos;re not ?  what if it &apos;s adopted by a king ?  
yeah ,  because i hear the king is looking to adopt .  
monica ,  we are not ready to have two babies !  
that doesn &apos;t matter !  we have waited so long for this .  i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s two babies .  i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s three babies !  i don &apos;t care if the entire cast of  &quot; eight is enough &quot;  comes out of there !  we are taking them home ,  because they are our children !  
 okay .  shhh .  .  .   
okay .  
okay !  
here she comes !  
yeah .  
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye .  
oh my god !  what did you say ?  
nothing !  what do you say to that ?  
ross ,  you &apos;ve got to tell her how you feel !  
no way !  
you can &apos;t just give up !  is that what a dinosaur would do ?  
what ?  
dude ,  i &apos;m just trying to speak your language .  
ross ,  rachel doesn &apos;t know that you wanna get back together .  if she did ,  she might feel differently .  she might not even go .  
you really think so ?  
i &apos;m telling you !  oh ,  okay !  this is the part of the musical where there &apos;d be a really good convincing song .    &quot; bam - bam ,  don &apos;t take no for an answer .  bam - bam ,  don &apos;t let love fly away .  bam - bam - bam - bam .  .  .  &quot;

hey !  
hi !  so i just dropped emma off at my mom &apos;s .  
okay .  
oh ,  you &apos;re not taking her with you tonight ?

wow ,  eight hour flight with a one - year old ?  good luck ,  mom .  
are you kidding ?  eight hours with my mother talking about atkins ?  good luck ,  emma !

ross ,  wait !

rachel ?  
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t know if that changes your plans at all ,  but i thought you should know .  
 gunther .  .  .  oh .  .  .  i love you too .  probably not in the same way ,  but i do .  and ,  and when i &apos;m in a caf ,  having coffee ,  or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun ,  i &apos;ll think of you .  aw .

alright ,  look ,  i have to go .  i love you ,  and i will call you the minute i get to paris .

has it always been purple ?  
 look around ,  you guys .  this was your first home .  and it was a happy place ,  filled with love and laughter .  but more important ,  because of rent control ,  it was a friggin &apos; steal !   
hey ,  do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment ?  
oh ,  yeah ,  that &apos;s true .  
uh ,  i haven &apos;t .
