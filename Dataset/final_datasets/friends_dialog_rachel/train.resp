<rachel> yeah ,  dont push it though .

<rachel> yeah .   a year ago .  .  
<rachel> but ,  pheebs ,  you can still use the copy machine where i actually work .  but ,  just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you .  cause kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much .

<rachel> so i hear the ralph lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room .   
<rachel> yeah .  your teeth ?  yes ,  i saw them from outside .   you guys are never going to believe this .  but ,  phoebe made out with ralph lauren .  
<rachel> yeah i know .  she ran into him at my office and they just made out .  and the craziest thing is ,  now my boss likes me because i told her about it and she said it was the best gossip shed heard all year .  
<rachel> that - that is your make out buddy .  dont you recognize him ?   oh wait .  ohh ,  phoebe i love you .  kiss me please .  
<rachel> what ?  
<rachel> oh my god ,  phoebe ,  thats not ralph lauren .  thats kenny the copy guy .  
<rachel> oh .  . go .  . oh .  . and i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren .  if she finds out that i lied to her ,  she is going to hate me even more .  phoebe !  !  
<rachel> to get you to make out with him !  !  !  
<rachel> yeah ,  remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday ?  well it didnt happen .  
<rachel> okay ,  two things didnt happen .  remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room ?  well ,  it turns out thats not true .  
<rachel> no .  
<rachel> oh no ,  no ,  no .  oh god ,  you think i made out with him .  
<rachel> i - i dont want your job .  i - i dont .  ohh this is such a mistake .  i did not make out with him .  nobody made out with him .  i did not use my keycard yesterday .  i dont even know how to use my keycard .   
<rachel> i did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren .  
<rachel> you were with kenny today ,  werent you ?  
<rachel> ohh ,  phoebe ,  what am i going to do ?  
<rachel> im not going to sleep with ralph lauren .  i mean ,  i could ,  but i wouldnt .  
<rachel> that wouldnt help me .  
<rachel> okay .  . okay .  .  look .  im sorry that i lied to you before .  you were right .  ralph and i were an item but were not anymore .  
<rachel>  yeah ,  he dumped me .  he said ,   &quot; rachel ,  i cant do this .  even though you are a very ,  very ,  very beautiful women .  i cant do this .  im married and im sorry .  &quot;  and then i dont know why but he said ,   &quot; and you will never get promoted .  especially not above kim ,  who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine .  &quot;  
<rachel> of course its true and it hurts so bad .  
<rachel> you and ralph ?  
<rachel> hey !  hey ,  pheebs ,  check it out .  yeah ,  for my desert ,  i have chosen to make a traditional english truffle !  
<rachel>  nothing ?  
<rachel> so ,  if - if i mess this up ,  theres nothing else for dessert ?  
<rachel> wow ,  monica ,  i love that ,  you really have faith in me .  thank you .  technical question ,  how do you know when uh ,  the butters done ?

<rachel>  look at it ,  isnt it beautiful ?  
<rachel> its a truffle .  its got all of these layers .  first theres a layer of ladyfingers ,  then a layer of jam ,  then custard ,  which i made from scratch ,   then raspberries ,  more ladyfingers ,  then beef sauteed with peas and onions ,   then a little more custard ,  and then bananas ,  and then i just put some whipped cream on top !   
<rachel> the beef ?  yeah ,  that was weird to me ,  too .  but then ,  yknow ,  i thought well ,  theres mincemeat pie ,  i mean thats an english dessert ,  these people just put very strange things in their food ,  yknow .   oh !  by the way ,  can i borrow some rum from your place ?  
<rachel>  and while im gone dont you boys sneak a taste .   
<rachel> joey ,  god ,  your apartment is like a hundred degrees !

<rachel> yeah ?  
<rachel>  no ,  i did ,  but tell me again ,  because its so romantic .  
<rachel> joey !  come on !  i dont wanna make any mistakes ,  alright ?  this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody &apos;s gonna be like oh ,  remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle ?   
<rachel> so why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it ,  alright ?  
<rachel> okay .  .  .   
<rachel> whats up ,  ross ?  
<rachel> yeah !

<rachel> no ,  i - i live with phoebe .  i mean youre  alone ,  alone .  and i just - its just not the time for us .  im sorry .  
<rachel> joey ,  youre gonna have to stop rushing me ,  you know what ?  you dont get any dessert .

<rachel> yeah ,  but she also invited you and ross .  yeah ,  honey ,  im sorry ,  but i dont think that was a romantic thing .

<rachel> its not a miracle joey !  im sure theres some explanation .  
<rachel> joey ,  i really dont

<rachel> yeah ?  wow !  yknow ,  that this thing has speakers in the headrest !

<rachel> i just purchased the la - z - boy e - cliner 3000 .

<rachel> were the cobras !  
<rachel> ahhhh  .  
<rachel> uh - huh .  
<rachel> hey !

<rachel>  no ,  i know !  i get it !  its funny !  
<rachel> no i know ,  because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i dont have any of those things .  thats why its so funny .   
<rachel> well ,  i feel fine ,  but i think youre bumming out the rest of the kids .  
<rachel> okay !  yknow what ?  i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids .  all i really needed was a plan .  see i wanna have three kids 
<rachel> as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years .  i love this plan !  i wanna marry this plan !  
<rachel> so ,  if i wanna have my kid when im 35 ,  i dont have to get pregnant until im 34 .  which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes !  oh wait ,  but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant 
<rachel> no ,  so i dont have to get married until im 33 !  thats three years ,  thats three whole yearsoh ,  wait a minute though .  ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding ,  and id like to know the guy for a year ,  year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time im thirty .  
<rachel> no !  ross ,  no !  it is not fine !  eh - eh - according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry !   
<rachel> hey .   oh ,  poor pheebs .  
<rachel> ross ,  i really dont think 
<rachel> actually ,  i just wanna talk to tag .

<rachel> wow ,  monica ,  you look just like your grandmother .  how old was she there ?

<rachel> oh ,  can we read them ?  
<rachel> okay .  
<rachel>  monica ,  will - will you marry me ?   
<rachel> wait a minute !   you let ross drive the porsche and when i ask you ,  you say youre the only one whos allowed to drive it .  
<rachel>  you let joey drive it ?  !  
<rachel> wow !  i cant believe you lied to me .  
<rachel> take the top down did ya ?  
<rachel> come on ross give me the keys !  monica does not know what shes talking about !  i am an excellent driver !  
<rachel> well in high school ,  that added up to head cheerleader .   
<rachel> i think shes checking out your beehive ross .  
<rachel> gimme the keys !  
<rachel> well no brush !  
<rachel>  alimony .   
<rachel> my god !  
<rachel> just washing the windshield .   
<rachel> oh .  of the steering wheel .  does anyone know why that is ?  its a tradition left over from porsches racing history .  the worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans .  which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday .  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track .  at the start of the race ,  the drivers would run across the track ,  get in the car ,  buckle up ,  start the car ,  and drive off .  porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took .  since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel ,  that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat - belts ,  put the car in gear and start it .  the drivers left hand did nothing .  porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24 - hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat - belts with his right hand .  thats why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel . } 
<rachel> look ross ,  if youre so freaked out ,  just get in the car !  
<rachel> all right .   
<rachel> what are you doing ?  !  get in the front !

<rachel>  oh god .  
<rachel>  joey ,  there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much  oh don &apos;t cover its ears !   it &apos;s because it reminds her of her uncle joey !  
<rachel> yeah !  and she &apos;s comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much .  
<rachel> oh yeah !  but you know what ?  if you need hugsy ,  don &apos;t worry .  emma will totally understand .  i won &apos;t .  .  .  but whatever  .

<rachel> still nervous ?  
<rachel> yeah !  
<rachel> yeah ,  yeah sure !  yeah !   
<rachel> so hi !  
<rachel> so you eh ,  you talked to joey ?  
<rachel> oh !  that &apos;s great !  
<rachel> oh ,  so everything &apos;s okay ?  
<rachel> ah .  .  .  well ,  obviously i think so too .  
<rachel> really ?  excited ?  
<rachel> excuse me !   you didn &apos;t tell him ,  did you ?  
<rachel> oh god !  alright ,  fine .  you know what joey ,  forget it .  when we go back to new york ,  i will tell him .  
<rachel> that was one time ,  ross ,  and they were only like 5 milligrams .  
<rachel> aaah .  .  .  ross ,  actually there &apos;s something that i really need to talk to you about .  
<rachel> okay ,  uhm .  .  .  alright ,  here &apos;s the deal .  
<rachel> what ?  what is it ?  
<rachel> uh ,  look ross ,  this really isn &apos;t easy .  
<rachel> because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo ?  
<rachel> well ,  yeah .  .  .  okay ,  look it &apos;s about me and .  .  .  
<rachel> wow !  well ,  clearly this is not a good time .  
<rachel> hi !  
<rachel> well ,  i tried ,  but then he had a shampoo related emergency .  so i guess now it &apos;s your turn again .  
<rachel> yeah ,   &apos;cause that &apos;s what we do .  
<rachel> okay ,  that sounds fair .  it just means that once again we can &apos;t .  .  .  
<rachel> no !  of course we can wait .  alright ,  so i guess that means good night then ?  
<rachel> goo -  - ood night !  
<rachel> seriously ,  good night !  
<rachel> okay .   commercial break 
<rachel> we weren &apos;t doing anything !  
<rachel> shhh .  
<rachel> no ,  come on ,  that is a lie .  we also kissed in barbados .  okay ,  we also kissed in barbados ,  but we didn &apos;t plan it ,  okay ?  and the only reason that that happened was because i saw you kissing charlie .  
<rachel> yeah ,  you started it !  i &apos;ve got to chill .  
<rachel> we feel so terrible about this ,  ross .  
<rachel> ross ?   can we just close the door ?  opening credits 
<rachel> no ,  no ,  no !  
<rachel> ross ,  this is not how we wanted you to find out about this .  you have every right to go nuts .  
<rachel> no ,  but you know what i mean .  
<rachel> calm ourselves ?  
<rachel> well ,  what would we be doing ?  
<rachel> feel me up ?  
<rachel> hey .  
<rachel> oh ,  you bet .   
<rachel> okay ,  well ,  we brought you some wine .  
<rachel> well ,  maybe the next batch ,  we could all get some .  
<rachel> no awareness .  
<rachel> look ,  charlie ,  i just want you to know .  ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me .  you know ,  he normally doesn &apos;t drink like this .  
<rachel> ross ,  you don &apos;t even have oven mitts on !   
<rachel> ooy .  
<rachel> oh my god ,  are we supposed to answer ?  
<rachel> ross ,  you don &apos;t seem okay .  it must be the pressure of entertaining .  i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan .  
<rachel> oh ,  that &apos;s okay ,  girls tend not to like me .  
<rachel> you know what ,  ross ?  i think we &apos;re gonna take off too .  
<rachel> no ,  no ,  it &apos;s just that it &apos;s getting late .  .  .  
<rachel> yeah ,  that &apos;s probably a good idea .  
<rachel> uh - huh .  okay .  you know what ,  joey ,  i don &apos;t think he &apos;s ever gonna be okay with this .  
<rachel> so .  
<rachel> i say cheesy line ,  but ok .   
<rachel> i am sorry ,  i dont know ,  i am sorry ,  i dont know why i did that !  
<rachel> ok ,  so sorry .   
<rachel> i am sorry !  again .  .  .  i don &apos;t know ,  i dont know what happened ,  i must be nervous !  
<rachel> ok ,  ok ,  ok .  i promise ,  i promise ,  i promise ,  i wont do it again .  i really do .  i promise .  this is gonna be great .
