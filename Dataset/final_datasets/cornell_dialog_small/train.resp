<s> Cameron.
<s> Let me see what I can do.
<s> Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
<s> I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
<s> I believe we share an art instructor
<s> Tons
<s> I was?
<s> Then that's all you had to say.
<s> You always been this selfish?
<s> No.
<s> Who?
<s> Is he oily or dry?
<s> I did.
<s> It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
<s> At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
<s> Can we go now?
<s> Like you care.
<s> I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
<s> God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
<s> What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
<s> Perm?
<s> No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
<s> Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
<s> Exactly my point
<s> It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
<s> I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
<s> Thirty-two.
<s> Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
<s> Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
<s> You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
<s> Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
<s> It's a lung cancer issue
<s> Dead at forty-one.
<s> I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
<s> You get the girl.
<s> And why would I do that?
<s> Do what?
<s> Are you lost?
<s> We're not.
<s> An attempted slit.
<s> No fear.
<s> Who cares?
<s> I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
<s> Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
<s> Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
<s> Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
<s> And why would I do that?
<s> You -- covered in my vomit.
<s> That's what you want, isn't it?
<s> I'm fine. I'm
<s> You know what they say
<s> But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
<s> Busy
<s> You 're so --
<s> Unwelcome.
<s> I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
<s> For. . . ?
<s> No one else knows
<s> I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
<s> Because you're making decisions for me.
<s> So what I want doesn't matter?
<s> What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
<s> Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
<s> I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
<s> No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
<s> Just smack her now.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeah.  I guess.
<s> Yeah...
<s> The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
<s> Good enough.
<s> Just for now.
<s> Make anyone cry today?
<s> Dr. Ruth?
<s> But -- who -- what --?
<s> We'll all go crazy...
<s> Excellency, you are right.
<s> The Judgment is ours!
<s> Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
<s> I am busy inside.
<s> Not bad.
<s> Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
<s> Call them.
<s> You did the same to your God!
<s> Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
<s> I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
<s> You'll always be older than me, Father.
<s> Surely you can do anything you want.
<s> You will regret this.
<s> Six days ago, yes.
<s> You're right.  Let the men decide.
<s> Yes, Your Majesty.
<s> Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
<s> He must be replaced.
<s> Then why?
<s> Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
<s> I was all of these.
<s> No, he is here.  Shit...
<s> Give me another one, please.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
<s> You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
<s> It was my decision, not his.
<s> Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
<s> I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
<s> Who do you think, Chief?!
<s> Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
<s> Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
<s> Vodka tonic.
<s> Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
<s> Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
<s> Describe him.
<s> He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
<s> No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
<s> No, what is it?
<s> Nah, why should you?
<s> Pretty.
<s> Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
<s> Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
<s> Stay here.
<s> Better than one.
<s> I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
<s> Something back home?
<s> Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
<s> You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
<s> Then do it, asshole.
<s> We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
<s> Alright.
<s> Hey.
<s> Tonight.
<s> Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
<s> I'm not moody.
<s> My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
<s> Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
<s> Where's Czech girl?
<s> Yes.
<s> Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
<s> Yes.  Both.
<s> Okay.
<s> Good idea!
<s> Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
<s> Shut up.  Look!
<s> Credit?
<s> Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
<s> Ha. Ha.
<s> A job?
<s> As a plumber?!
<s> You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
<s> You want the tape?  There it is!
<s> Paulie, you've got kids, right?
<s> No way!  He's mine!
<s> Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
<s> Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
<s> He knew all along.
<s> It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
<s> Your doctor?
<s> And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
<s> Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
<s> She's wonderful.
<s> Sure, what is it?
<s> What's up?
<s> Yes?
<s> Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
<s> Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
<s> I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
<s> Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
<s> I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
<s> How many days until you come home?
<s> Well, where are all of you off to?
<s> No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
<s> Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
<s> Fine.
<s> I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
<s> Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
<s> I want to pick up my car.
<s> Hammond.
<s> Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
<s> Yeah, dummy.  Money.
<s> It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
<s> Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Yeah, i been waiting three years.
<s> Now you're talkin'. See ya...
<s> Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
<s> No chance.
<s> You're done.  End of story.
<s> I got a lot to protect.
<s> You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
<s> Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
<s> Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
<s> I think you better put him on ice, man.
<s> If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
<s> Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
<s> Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
<s> But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
<s> I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
<s> Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
<s> Jesus.
<s> I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
<s> What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
<s> When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
<s> I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
<s> Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
<s> Yeah, I read the report...
<s> They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
<s> Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
<s> Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
<s> Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
<s> Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
<s> You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
<s> You're hopeless.
<s> Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
<s> Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
<s> No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
<s> Hi, it's me...
<s> Where is he?
<s> I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
<s> It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
<s> You know exactly where they are!
<s> Dallas. Korben Dallas.
<s> Good luck..
<s> Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
<s> This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
<s> Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
<s> I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
<s> Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
<s> I was talking to the cat.
<s> Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
<s> It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
<s> You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
<s> I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
<s> When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
<s> We will be ready, Lord.
<s> I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
<s> ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
<s> I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
<s> This is a police control action..
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
<s> Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
<s> Apipoussan!
<s> I'm so tired...
<s> I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
<s> Uh..
<s> It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
<s> Wonderful!
<s> It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
<s> Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
<s> Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
<s> ...I can't wait to be among you.
<s> Sure.  I'll call the guy.
<s> I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
<s> I don't know.  I'm sorry...
<s> I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
<s> I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
<s> Amy...
<s> What you see is what I got, mister.
<s> Hmm.
<s> I'll consider it.
<s> I'm camera shy.
<s> I remember him.
<s> You betrayed us.
<s> We do.
<s> I know what you did.
<s> Show me.
<s> I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
<s> I'm listening.
<s> Of what sort?
<s> That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
<s> I'm asking.
<s> Enlighten me.
<s> I'll risk it.
<s> Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
<s> Max.
<s> What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
<s> It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
<s> I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
<s> It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
<s> I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
<s> Do you want to tell me what you found?
<s> You've found missing persons before.
<s> My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
<s> Okay, I follow you so far...
<s> Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
<s> Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
<s> I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
<s> Neil... Neil Cole.
<s> No.
<s> It got to be too much for him.
<s> No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
<s> Okay.
<s> We're all like that.
<s> You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
<s> I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
<s> That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
<s> She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
<s> He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
<s> But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
<s> Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
<s> Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
<s> Three days.
<s> Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
<s> Who?
<s> Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
<s> It's okay, we're just about there.
<s> You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
<s> I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
<s> How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
<s> Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
<s> Avoid-all-contact-day.
<s> When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
<s> You just stay put.  You need rest.
<s> Don't worry, honey
<s> It's okay, Dan
<s> And ours.  It's our grandchild.
<s> You're not taking my baby!
<s> Been having bad dreams.
<s> No...
<s> She doesn't want me around
<s> Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
<s> He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
<s> They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
<s> You sure you don't want a ride to work?
<s> I've got to go.
<s> When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
<s> No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
<s> Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
<s> So did Dan.
<s> Well we gotta do something!
<s> That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
<s> That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
<s> She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
<s> Next life.  Oh, what's that?
<s> Yeah...
<s> Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
<s> It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
<s> Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
<s> Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
<s> Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<s> You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
<s> You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
<s> - any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
<s> But if they <u>do</u>?
<s> Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
<s> You know - it <u>is</u>?
<s> Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
<s> The sound again?
<s> Somewhere down there?
<s> I...don't know!
<s> The frogmen?
<s> Under <u>water</u>?
<s> I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
<s> Who with?
<s> Huh?
<s> What?
<s> I am afraid not.  Therefore -
<s> That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
<s> Obviously.
<s> I'll be another!
<s> Toward the Pole!
<s> This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
<s> Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
<s> Twombley involved?
<s> He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
<s> It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
<s> Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
<s> Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
<s> Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
<s> Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
<s> Shit! What are we gonna do?
<s> You think so.
<s> Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Hmm.
<s> LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
<s> Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
<s> Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
<s> Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
<s> Right!
<s> What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
<s> I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
<s> I guess they're stupid.
<s> I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
<s> No.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
<s> Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
<s> What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
<s> I'm fine, fine.
<s> So?
<s> Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
<s> Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
<s> Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
<s> Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
<s> No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
<s> Hi honey.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
<s> I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
<s> You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
<s> But not now.
<s> It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
<s> Wade.
<s> Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
<s> Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
<s> It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
<s> How's that?
<s> I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
<s> Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
<s> Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
<s> I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
<s> Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
<s> We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
<s> Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
<s> Crawl!
<s> Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
<s> Twombley.
<s> You think Jack shot him?
<s> Huh?
<s> No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
<s> Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
<s> Want to know what I think happened?
<s> Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
<s> Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
<s> Yes dear?
<s> Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
<s> It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
<s> It was the experience of a lifetime.
<s> Been better, Dad... You?
<s> It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
<s> Okay, I'm slowing us down.
<s> Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
<s> I'm doing what I can.
<s> Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
<s> We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
<s> Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
<s> This doesn't make sense.
<s> Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
<s> Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
<s> The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
<s> I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
<s> Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
<s> Over my dead body.
<s> Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
<s> You'll do it?
<s> One thing I've learned as
<s> Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
<s> Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
<s> Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
<s> But...
<s> I might still have a few chips left.
<s> Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
<s> Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
<s> Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
<s> We're hooked. Hove into position.
<s> Commissioner.
<s> Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
<s> Commissioner, Aquarius.
<s> Dunn.
<s> Accelerators down.
<s> I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
<s> Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
<s> Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
<s> What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
<s> Ted!
<s> Ted, there's no time to explain.
<s> Not now, Elaine.
<s> I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
<s> What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
<s> Is he making any progress, Doctor?
<s> And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
<s> I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
<s> No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
<s> Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
<s> It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
<s> How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
<s> Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
<s> Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
<s> Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
<s> I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
<s> Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
<s> Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
<s> No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
<s> I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
<s> Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
<s> I can't tell.
<s> Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
<s> I just don't want to go over it any more.
<s> Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
<s> Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
<s> My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
<s> That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
<s> Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
<s> I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
<s> You promise you'll write.
<s> Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
<s> Yes, Captain?
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
<s> Huh?
<s> Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
<s> All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
<s> Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
<s> Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
<s> Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
<s> You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
<s> And that fits?
<s> Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
<s> Did you learn anything?
<s> We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
<s> Why'd I do what?
<s> Stay back!  I'm okay.
<s> Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
<s> Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
<s> When will Strader return?
<s> I appreciate your honesty, George.
<s> In the other man's rectum.
<s> You must leave me alone on this.
<s> Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
<s> You look very good.
<s> Only holds five.
<s> Who else can I ask around here?
<s> Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
<s> Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
<s> Departmental policy.
<s> But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
<s> Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
<s> Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
<s> Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
<s> Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
<s> She's right.
<s> Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
<s> We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
<s> It's insured.
<s> Shut up.  Just shut up!
<s> Sir?
<s> ...We're coming in.
<s> You tell me.  I only work here.
<s> Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
<s> Poor bastard.
<s> On my way.
<s> Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
<s> But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
<s> Let's waste him.  No offense.
<s> I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
<s> How long have I been on Gateway station?
<s> Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
<s> They're dead.
<s> I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
<s> You mean dead.
<s> That's right.
<s> Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
<s> Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
<s> Yes.
<s> In a harem.
<s> A Turkish brothel.
<s> What?
<s> Don't bother.
<s> Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
<s> Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
<s> I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
<s> Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
<s> Who the devil are you? What do you want?
<s> I want to go back to Vienna.
<s> Why? People fart backwards.
<s> Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
<s> Em iram! Em iram!
<s> Oh, leave me alone.
<s> They'll come anyway. They love me here.
<s> Tell them to go!
<s> What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
<s> Oh, damn!
<s> Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
<s> Why?
<s> He's terribly busy, sir.
<s> My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
<s> No, sir. This is my own idea.
<s> Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
<s> He asked me to stay.
<s> No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
<s> Behold!
<s> Gertrude!
<s> Yes. He is a little strange.
<s> Ah, now! Here she comes.
<s> You do me too much honour, Sire.
<s> Your Highness.
<s> Yes?
<s> You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
<s> Well. There it is.
<s> Yes?
<s> Who told you this, Majesty?
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
<s> Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
<s> Papa!
<s> Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
<s> In there, sir.
<s> I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
<s> German!
<s> No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
<s> Wolfi!
<s> What is this?
<s> Can I see it?
<s> Why not?
<s> Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
<s> Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
<s> Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
<s> No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
<s> Really?
<s> Ah!
<s> Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
<s> It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
<s> She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
<s> Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
<s> You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
<s> Of course not.
<s> Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
<s> Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
<s> It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
<s> Thank you! Oh, thank you.
<s> I never knew that music like that was possible.
<s> Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
<s> What work?
<s> Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
<s> Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
<s> Of course.
<s> The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
<s> We ended in F Major?
<s> Yes.
<s> But, Your Majesty -
<s> Certainly, Herr Director.
<s> But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
<s> On the contrary.
<s> Mozart -
<s> Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
<s> Baron!
<s> Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
<s> I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
<s> Here in Vienna.
<s> His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
<s> Italian?
<s> Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
<s> I agree, Baron.
<s> Excuse me, my dear.
<s> Show her in. Then go to bed.
<s> Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
<s> Of course.
<s> What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> He said 'Jack'.
<s> What happened to them?
<s> Come to my office, Miss Price.
<s> At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
<s> David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
<s> Yes, I should think so.
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> I'm not very hungry, thank you.
<s> How is that?
<s> Call me Alex.
<s> That's not really a very proper question.
<s> Not just a patient -- me.
<s> I wasn't hallucinating.
<s> Okay.
<s> See you later.
<s> Pull over.
<s> No.
<s> Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
<s> Has he been refusing food?
<s> Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
<s> Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
<s> You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
<s> No, but we're about to.
<s> Oh, come on, tell us.
<s> Do you have bad dreams, too?
<s> Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
<s> Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
<s> Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
<s> I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
<s> It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
<s> Wrong.
<s> Come on, I'm freezing.
<s> Heathcliffe didn't howl.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
<s> It's circling us.
<s> Do you think it's a dog?
<s> Walk away, Jack.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Are you going to help me up?
<s> We were attacked by a werewolf.
<s> What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
<s> Nurse!
<s> Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
<s> I wanted to see you.
<s> David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
<s> Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
<s> He's on the telephone.
<s> No.
<s> And what, Sergeant?
<s> You here again? What do you want?
<s> I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
<s> She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
<s> I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
<s> Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
<s> I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
<s> Not yet, Mr. Clark.
<s> Take it easy, Clark.
<s> Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
<s> That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
<s> So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
<s> I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
<s> We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
<s> All right, Jack, all right.
<s> I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
<s> Why not?
<s> All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
<s> Well, you can. You always could.
<s> What is?
<s> Line?
<s> No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
<s> What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
<s> John, how's your wife this morning?
<s> That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
<s> Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
<s> But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
<s> Where is he now?
<s> Yes?
<s> Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
<s> I haven't any.
<s> Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
<s> Were you in Cluett's apartment?
<s> Was Mrs. Dickson there?
<s> Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
<s> If he can do it, yes.
<s> So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
<s> Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What'll we do?
<s> Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
<s> Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
<s> Well, he was making love to her.
<s> Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
<s> Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
<s> Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
<s> Mr. Williams . . .
<s> Yes, why?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> wasn't anywhere near this place—
<s> Yes.
<s> Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
<s> You stay out of this, Bob.
<s> It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
<s> As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
<s> What have you done?
<s> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<s> Swear on Jimmy's grave.
<s> Best damn plan I heard all war.
<s> Hey!
<s> One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
<s> Tell me.
<s> No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
<s> Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
<s> You're not scared, are you?
<s> She got two of them.
<s> She was European!
<s> Perfect, Cole.
<s> I got three.
<s> It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
<s> Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
<s> Pass me some whisky.
<s> Missed you too, cousin.
<s> They gonna rush us?
<s> Of course!  Uh, sir?
<s> The District Marshall
<s> You're right, sir.
<s> I'd appreciate that.
<s> So?
<s> I had you covered.  From back there.
<s> Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
<s> The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
<s> I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
<s> Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
<s> Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
<s> Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
<s> I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
<s> So what was he?
<s> Yeah Jimmy?
<s> A fair number, Ma.
<s> You were little Jesse James when you left.
<s> I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
<s> No! I mean, of course not. No.
<s> What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
<s> A river pirate.
<s> Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
<s> When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
<s> I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
<s> Yes ma'am.
<s> Yes ma'am.
<s> So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
<s> Ahh, you'll miss me.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
<s> That is so gentlemanly of you.
<s> How much did they get from the safe?
<s> Can you put men at all four?
<s> What is that?
<s> Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
<s> Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
<s> Yes, dear.
<s> What do you want, Courtney?
<s> Oh God, just get it over with.
<s> Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
<s> Yes?
<s> Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
<s> It's not that nice.
<s> No-I can't take the time off work.
<s> Because I...want...to...fit...in.
<s> Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
<s> Everybody has a great body now.
<s> It's not.
<s> Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
<s> We never really shared one.
<s> Oh God, I can't believe this.
<s> Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
<s> I won't...don't worry.
<s> Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
<s> What exactly do you mean?
<s> No, you...didn't?
<s> Patrick?
<s> What?
<s> Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
<s> Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
<s> Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
<s> When?
<s> Just...say...no.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
<s> Patrick?
<s> Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
<s> Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
<s> No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
<s> No, not really.
<s> Growing. I'm glad you said that.
<s> Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
<s> I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
<s> Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
<s> Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
<s> Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
<s> He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
<s> Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
<s> Does he do this all the time?
<s> No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
<s> Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
<s> So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
<s> No. I'm okay.
<s> No problem. 
<s> I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
<s> Hang...out?
<s> Eerie. Really eerie.
<s> Don.
<s> Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
<s> Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
<s> God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
<s> Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
<s> Not a big music fan, eh?
<s> Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
<s> Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
<s> I'm hungry.
<s> What am I gonna do?
<s> Al.
<s> Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
<s> We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
<s> Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
<s> Yes, Owen?
<s> I can paint anywhere.
<s> I think that's great, Milo. I do.
<s> That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
<s> What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
<s> I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
<s> You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
<s> Milo. Why would he --
<s> ...Why?
<s> Poor baby. You know that's not true.
<s> ...Different?
<s> He'll tell me when he gets home.
<s> Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
<s> 'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
<s> Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
<s> He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
<s> Oh hi.
<s> Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
<s> I do!
<s> Okay. I'm Gary.
<s> That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
<s> Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
<s> You're making me young again.
<s> 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
<s> You look a little tired.
<s> I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
<s> I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
<s> He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
<s> Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
<s> You know my name.
<s> No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
<s> Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
<s> No. Please.
<s> Why's that?
<s> She saved my life.
<s> Hmm?
<s> Certainly not at my happy home.
<s> What?
<s> A what?
<s> I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
<s> The dishes are juiced up, too.
<s> It's three years old, it --
<s> What?!
<s> What does that mean?
<s> You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
<s> Where is he?
<s> What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
<s> You may.
<s> Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
<s> Is it about my teeth?
<s> If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
<s> Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
<s> Good luck, Austin.
<s> You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
<s> You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
<s> Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
<s> Yes?
<s> What's the other thing you're scared of?
<s> Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
<s> Yes Basil?
<s> Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
<s> No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
<s> Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
<s> Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
<s> Sure.
<s> Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
<s> I'm sure.
<s> Here, use mine.
<s> How do you know?
<s> No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
<s> Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
<s> Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
<s> It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
<s> Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
<s> You know who.
<s> I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
<s> Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
<s> Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
<s> I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
<s> Lay it on me.
<s> Is it one of ours?
<s> Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
<s> Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
<s> Not me.
<s> Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
<s> Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
<s> Blow me.
<s> Show me.
<s> Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
<s> All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
<s> Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
<s> You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
<s> Of course not. I was married to your father.
<s> OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
<s> OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
<s> Love...
<s> Mr. John Steed, please.
<s> We have met ...
<s> Hmmm ...
<s> Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
<s> Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
<s> Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
<s> To find out who killed my husband.
<s> Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
<s> 'Our revels now are ended.'
<s> I'm already married ...
<s> How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
<s> And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
<s> Mother?
<s> Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
<s> I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
<s> Is that written in his shoe?
<s> ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
<s> Not for a moment.
<s> Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
<s> You lied.
<s> ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
<s> I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
<s> Why's he called 'Invisible'?
<s> I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
<s> It's called Black Leather.
<s> Have a look at this.
<s> '... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
<s> Still a bit chilly ...
<s> Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
<s> I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
<s> You're saying I have no choice.
<s> It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
<s> I fail to see --
<s> Well, I can't possibly go like this.
<s> ... and now?
<s> She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
<s> Where?
<s> Stay by the window. By the window.
<s> You are, and it's behind you.
<s> Check out the other guy's buns.
<s> Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
<s> Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
<s> When do the girls get to the party?
<s> Five thousand dollars.
<s> He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
<s> Oh, come on, just a little.
<s> The car for Debbie?
<s> Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
<s> Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
<s> Mr. Thomerson.
<s> Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
<s> But how can I do that?
<s> What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
<s> Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
<s> Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
<s> 1002.
<s> Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
<s> Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
<s> Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
<s> Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> About what?
<s> Good...
<s> Gonna get married...
<s> C'mon, I knew it was you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
<s> Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
<s> All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
<s> Let's have a toast.
<s> Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
<s> It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
<s> I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
<s> No, Brett, I...
<s> Nothing... Let's get crazy!
<s> Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
<s> I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
<s> Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
<s> Oooooo.
<s> If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
<s> Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
<s> Who's your friend?
<s> What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
<s> You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
<s> Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
<s> No.  I need a drink.
<s> -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
<s> My Lt. might have something to say about that.
<s> -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
<s> Who asked you?
<s> It works.
<s> Thanks for the speakers.
<s> Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
<s> -- C'mon, Stephen.
<s> Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
<s> What, are you kidding? By myself?
<s> You got a problem with drilling, probie?
<s> Roll the hose.
<s> I waited... I would have fucking waited...
<s> Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
<s> Thanks for the insight.
<s> Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
<s> You're selling dad's boat?
<s> -- What are you doing here?
<s> They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
<s> Jennifer.
<s> Really? No kidding.
<s> I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
<s> Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
<s> Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
<s> Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
<s> Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
<s> You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
<s> Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
<s> Hi.
<s> Hey, do I know you?
<s> Who's doing this?
<s> Then who --
<s> I don't have a story.
<s> I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
<s> The outlets.
<s> You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
<s> Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
<s> What are you listening to?
<s> -- Another backdraft.
<s> Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
<s> What reason?
<s> That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
<s> I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
<s> Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
<s> Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
<s> You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
<s> Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
<s> Nice boat.
<s> Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
<s> "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
<s> Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
<s> I'll be there, goddamn it!
<s> Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
<s> Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
<s> The great communicator.
<s> Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
<s> Putty? On both doors?
<s> Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> And the world -- the whole world.
<s> Investigator Rimgale.
<s> Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
<s> This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
<s> She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes.
<s> Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
<s> All right, cop. I want my money.
<s> All right. What are you gonna do?
<s> I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
<s> That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
<s> What case?
<s> Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
<s> Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
<s> I'm on it.
<s> Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
<s> So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
<s> You might be right.
<s> She's also moorish.
<s> Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
<s> Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
<s> Meaning?
<s> Damn skippy.
<s> Different.
<s> You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
<s> Did we get our bill yet?
<s> Well do something about it.
<s> How you sound?
<s> Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
<s> So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
<s> I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
<s> Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
<s> So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
<s> Who are the other characters?
<s> I don't know about that plantation angle.
<s> To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
<s> I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
<s> If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
<s> No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
<s> Dunwitty, don't leave.
<s> We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
<s> Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
<s> I want to speak with you.
<s> It's been a long time.
<s> Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
<s> The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
<s> Always keep 'em laughing.
<s> What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
<s> Do you know how you will use him?
<s> Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
<s> Which one is your brother?
<s> Everybody shut up.
<s> A gift.
<s> Please don't go there.
<s> David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
<s> I feel fine.
<s> Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
<s> What you did is dead wrong.
<s> It looks delicious.
<s> If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
<s> You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
<s> Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
<s> The best defense is offense.
<s> Thank you.  And always smile.
<s> This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
<s> Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
<s> ...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
<s> No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
<s> ...I heard different, thought that was...
<s> That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
<s> Enough.
<s> Just a little something' somethin'.
<s> For what?  He left.  Not me.
<s> I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
<s> It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
<s> What is your uncle's name?
<s> I have acted as I think fit.
<s> Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
<s> He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
<s> We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
<s> Is Miss Dugan well?
<s> Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
<s> The coward!
<s> I have faced that problem before.
<s> Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
<s> But, for a time... a passing fancy?
<s> Have you not a man whom you value?
<s> Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
<s> By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
<s> Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
<s> Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
<s> Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
<s> I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
<s> I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
<s> Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
<s> Black-eyed Sczortarska.
<s> You know that was like a quadruple negative?
<s> Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
<s> Who?
<s> We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
<s> We found him like this...
<s> Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
<s> But not Pike's.
<s> Epilepsy.
<s> One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
<s> Sir, Dunbar, sir!
<s> We just want to check your pack --
<s> Look in my pack.
<s> From up close or far away?
<s> Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
<s> Mr. Hardy?
<s> Stop.
<s> How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
<s> My heart weeps.
<s> No. I said Dunbar.
<s> Well?
<s> Because I was standing next to him.
<s> I don't know --
<s> And the problem is you only got three.
<s> I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
<s> The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
<s> JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
<s> I wanted to see if he was okay --
<s> I'm not even going to dignify that --
<s> You're crazy --
<s> That is the most unprofessional --
<s> Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
<s> You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
<s> Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
<s> What?
<s> And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
<s> Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
<s> And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
<s> And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
<s> That bugs you too?
<s> What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
<s> You wanted to get the truth.
<s> Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
<s> That's gonna stay my secret.
<s> There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
<s> Really.
<s> Want company?
<s> I should probably write that down.
<s> Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
<s> Poor fucker my ass...
<s> Childs.
<s> Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
<s> We're not going anywhere.
<s> He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
<s> We know.
<s> It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
<s> Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Why?
<s> No one's ever left.
<s> Fine, I'm doing it.
<s> I brought it.
<s> Don.
<s> Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
<s> A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
<s> It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
<s> How did you know?
<s> Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
<s> Lucky girl.
<s> Beats me.
<s> That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
<s> Make him stop.
<s> No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
<s> The Old Lady by the swamp.
<s> Okay.
<s> I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
<s> I think someone hasn't.
<s> Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
<s> I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
<s> You think I'm fake.
<s> Like this.
<s> They're your favorite flower.
<s> Go out with me.
<s> Really.
<s> Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
<s> I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
<s> I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
<s> I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
<s> My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
<s> No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
<s> Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
<s> We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
<s> Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
<s> Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
<s> Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
<s> He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
<s> Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
<s> Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
<s> Do you want to stop?
<s> We'll stop then.
<s> It's nothing. I burnt myself.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh.  We are Russian.
<s> You're asking for my documents?
<s> What?
<s> Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
<s> He wants money.
<s> I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Syevodnya
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I know you just want to punish me --
<s> What? No you're not..
<s> No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
<s> I said I don't have any.
<s> He will come back.
<s> No. But you tend to tie them up.
<s> Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
<s> And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
<s> Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
<s> You didn't mind too much.
<s> So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
<s> I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
<s> No.
<s> I'm trying to quit.
<s> Except for Small Eyes.
<s> Please. Why not?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Oh, she older than that.
<s> I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
<s> Well. Hope you enjoy it.
<s> I do. God's truth. I do.
<s> Sure.
<s> She's around. Always is.
<s> That's not right, really, cuz I...
<s> Now wait...
<s> I begged him not to go. And he did.
<s> Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
<s> Let go...
<s> LAZ, I said let...!
<s> Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
<s> BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
<s> Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
<s> Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
<s> Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
<s> GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
<s> Two days?
<s> The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
<s> Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
<s> Itches.
<s> I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
<s> Anything.
<s> I'm here with you.
<s> Nothin'.
<s> No, you do it. I can't sing.
<s> Huh?
<s> Now, hold up.
<s> What'chu sayin'?
<s> R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
<s> What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
<s> Get me ten bags of mulch.
<s> Why she got a chain on her?
<s> Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
<s> You could put it that way.
<s> Are you wasted?
<s> Holy shit!
<s> Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
<s> Got in a little accident.
<s> Thought you had a man for that.
<s> The hell you call me?
<s> Let go...
<s> It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
<s> Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
<s> Beats forty hours on a plane.
<s> No.
<s> Hey, when in Rome --
<s> Let's grab some food.
<s> You said that in the last two places.
<s> What'd she say?
<s> What does Charlie mean?
<s> Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
<s> I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
<s> They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
<s> Yeah...
<s> I stole them.
<s> We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
<s> There she is!
<s> Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
<s> Good.  Very good...
<s> You can trust me.
<s> He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
<s> Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
<s> A wife.  She left.
<s> Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
<s> He's on duty.
<s> Where's Ich?
<s> You could fake it.
<s> Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
<s> The cheese...
<s> Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
<s> He killed a police officer.
<s> Do you know what this is?
<s> I want him.
<s> I'll pay you.
<s> You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
<s> I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
<s> Then go get him.
<s> Death.
<s> Come here.
<s> Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
<s> Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
<s> We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
<s> If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
<s> Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
<s> This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
<s> Why, yes, of course.
<s> The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
<s> I think we're through for the night.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Four years.
<s> No rust?
<s> Meaning?
<s> Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
<s> You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
<s> I don't know nothing about it.
<s> Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
<s> Does it eat?
<s> You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
<s> That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
<s> I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
<s> Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
<s> Dead.
<s> If they are smart, they take naps.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
<s> What difference will it make?
<s> Sorry.
<s> How do you know I'm not?
<s> Hi.
<s> I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
<s> Thanks.
<s> No, you get out of here.
<s> Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
<s> I haven't brushed yet.
<s> Hey, no kidding?  In color?
<s> What?
<s> No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
<s> Name it.
<s> The big one!
<s> Is this your house?
<s> He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
<s> Good for you.
<s> No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
<s> Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
<s> Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
<s> Good-bye!
<s> No way.
<s> Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
<s> Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
<s> Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
<s> I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
<s> Goodnight!
<s> Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
<s> Is that what you call it?
<s> Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
<s> Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
<s> My mother's like that.
<s> Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
<s> Yes.
<s> Gerade aus dann links!
<s> It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
<s> Blow out the candles!
<s> Yes, father?! Yes?
<s> It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
<s> Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
<s> You nut!
<s> True.
<s> I'm not wearing his pants.
<s> Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
<s> A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
<s> Bye, Adam!
<s> I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
<s> My father is a genius.
<s> Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
<s> Well, we're here to help!
<s> Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
<s> Sorry, Mom!
<s> Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
<s> What about relatives?
<s> The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
<s> You bet, hon!
<s> I never know anymore.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
<s> Then after that it's safe.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> Would you like a tranquilizer?
<s> No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
<s> What shall we call him?
<s> What?
<s> If he tells, it won't come true!
<s> Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
<s> Yes...
<s> It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
<s> Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
<s> Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
<s> Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
<s> No.
<s> Eve?!
<s> Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
<s> Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
<s> You're goddamn right I am!
<s> I know...I know. You did the right thing.
<s> We'll find him.
<s> What?!
<s> You bet, Mom! Coming up!
<s> Um...uh...
<s> Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
<s> You did? A human ear?
<s> It's blue. Blue velvet.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
<s> Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
<s> Jeffrey nothing.
<s> Nobody.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, I like you.
<s> What?
<s> Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
<s> I'm doing it.
<s> Does that scare you?
<s> Beeeee careful.
<s> No, it's not Don.
<s> You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
<s> There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
<s> Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
<s> No.  Hi baby.
<s> It's okay. It's okay.
<s> Who, Dorothy?
<s> Oh he forced you, huh?
<s> No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
<s> Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
<s> Speak to me Fucker.
<s> No thanks. What does that mean?
<s> Okay Frank.
<s> Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
<s> I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
<s> Do you want the car?
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
<s> Looks like you'd make a good runner.
<s> Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> It's good to see you, Dad.
<s> You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
<s> Am I bothering you?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
<s> There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
<s> Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
<s> Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
<s> Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
<s> Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
<s> Alright. Good luck, yourself.
<s> Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
<s> Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
<s> First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
<s> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
<s> Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
<s> Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
<s> I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
<s> Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
<s> Actually. I've been in twice.
<s> Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
<s> I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
<s> Okay, Sandy.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
<s> Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
<s> I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
<s> No.
<s> Okay. Great!
<s> You look beautiful.
<s> I can't dance fast.
<s> Dorothy Vallens?
<s> Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
<s> Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
<s> Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
<s> I can't find the second one, sir.
<s> This is a six-shooter.
<s> Let's do him right here.
<s> Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
<s> He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
<s> What happened?
<s> Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
<s> MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
<s> I-I'll tip her.
<s> This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
<s> What?  What, that guy?
<s> What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
<s> An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
<s> Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
<s> Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
<s> A bit.
<s> Just like on TV.
<s> We'll find it. Just calm down.
<s> A-fuckin'-men!
<s> With every breath we shall hunt them down.
<s> Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
<s> Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
<s> Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
<s> That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
<s> Of course they were. How many?
<s> My, my...
<s> Pee...Per...Man.
<s> It was... It was...
<s> Really want to know?
<s> The fat man.
<s> New hitman wants to leave his mark
<s> What about one guy with two guns?
<s> Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
<s> Sweet-n-low!
<s> Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
<s> I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
<s> I...
<s> Hallelujah, Jaffar.
<s> Hey Murph.
<s> Yeah. Anybody call for me?
<s> Well, I'm sold.
<s> Y-Yes my son.
<s> You feel?
<s> Yes.
<s> How long since your last confession, my son?
<s> Yeah boss?
<s> He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
<s> I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
<s> Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
<s> The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
<s> He says. This is he.
<s> But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
<s> Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
<s> I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
<s> Yeah, I saw it.
<s> We got it. We got it.
<s> Like he would find Dignan. One day.
<s> I keep it for emergencies.
<s> They obviously weren't designed for racing.
<s> I'll say it.
<s> No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
<s> On the left.
<s> This was in fourth grade.
<s> After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
<s> Yes... It's true.
<s> Maybe he just went to the store.
<s> If you say so.
<s> I don't think we can do that.
<s> Shh.
<s> Don't panic, Anthony.
<s> Ah. Couple days ago.
<s> Right now.
<s> Bob!
<s> What the fuck are we doing out here?
<s> I'm sorry, Bob.
<s> He was all right.
<s> As a person?
<s> Yes. I do.
<s> It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
<s> Careful. Check his pulse.
<s> Come on, Kumar.
<s> I'll see you there.
<s> I'll get him.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Can't remember shit. CRS.
<s> I'm not kidding.
<s> It belongs to Bob's uncle.
<s> Oh, I'd say about --
<s> Behind Bob's house.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> What?
<s> I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
<s> What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
<s> I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
<s> Hold it.
<s> Take a deep breath.
<s> Me?
<s> Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
<s> Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
<s> I hope not.
<s> OK, Dad.
<s> Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
<s> Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
<s> Sure.
<s> No.
<s> I didn't do anything.
<s> His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
<s> Temporarily.
<s> Is that Buckethead?
<s> That's your friend Anthony?
<s> True.
<s> I don't know about that.
<s> So who's going to know?
<s> Yes. I did.
<s> As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
<s> Good question.
<s> No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
<s> Well, don't blame me. I told you.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
<s> No. I was calm.
<s> I told you they were there.
<s> He wouldn't move.
<s> I don't know.
<s> The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I can't do that, Bob.
<s> What is it?
<s> I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
<s> Man, I don't want to go into this.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
<s> Look. We want you on the job.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What's that?
<s> I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
<s> 26 weeks.
<s> Well, I think --
<s> No, my friend knows her.
<s> Fight. You know.
<s> Pleasure to meet you, John.
<s> And the Landy woman?
<s> Anything else?
<s> I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
<s> Do you know what his budget was?
<s> It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
<s> I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
<s> Don't know.
<s> Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
<s> I speak English.
<s> Then what?
<s> You killed them.
<s> I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
<s> Conklin.
<s> Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
<s> I don't know who that is.
<s> -- my coat -- but we should --
<s> Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
<s> He was at the campground yesterday.
<s> We can't wait to be sure.
<s> What?
<s> What if it's not who you think it is?
<s> What is this, a game?
<s> I killed him???
<s> I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
<s> No. You never worked Berlin.
<s> Bourne?
<s> I want to come in.
<s> And the Germans can't match it?
<s> What?
<s> But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
<s> For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
<s> Me? Four years.
<s> Before this? Before Bourne? No.
<s> Am I a doctor, no, but...
<s> If you say so.
<s> You mean, did I want a date?
<s> And why is that?
<s> We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
<s> My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
<s> I don't want to leave.
<s> It was in Latin, sir.
<s> Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
<s> You've all sworn to Longshanks.
<s> He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
<s> No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
<s> That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
<s> He will. I know he will.
<s> Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
<s> Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
<s> You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
<s> ...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
<s> You fancy him.
<s> Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
<s> I rest.
<s> Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
<s> You win.
<s> That depends on the man.
<s> I will not.
<s> I should'a remembered the eggs.
<s> Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
<s> No. He did not.
<s> Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
<s> It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
<s> You are. And I'll come again.
<s> I... accept your proposal!
<s> You scare me.
<s> Wife of Edward, the king's son?
<s> I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
<s> I am trying.
<s> I must... consult with my father.
<s> But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
<s> Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
<s> Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
<s> The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
<s> I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
<s> Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
<s> Great. I'll see you soon.
<s> I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
<s> Weirder than this?
<s> I see a car.
<s> Where are my goddamn books?
<s> But I... I need those books.
<s> Photos?
<s> You really don't remember anything that happened?
<s> I've stopped a hundred times.
<s> Me? Are you kidding? Why?
<s> Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
<s> Those are your clothes, silly.
<s> So it didn't feel... weird?
<s> Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
<s> I walk differently?
<s> I get it. You can drop it now.
<s> You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
<s> Which is?
<s> It's crossed my mind from time to time.
<s> Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
<s> Who's to say you can't make things better?
<s> I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
<s> Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
<s> Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
<s> Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
<s> Yes, Monsieur.
<s> -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
<s> Er, my check, please.
<s> Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
<s> I don't buy or sell human beings.
<s> So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
<s> Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
<s> And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
<s> Yes, something.
<s> In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
<s> Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
<s> Richard, I had to see you.
<s> You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
<s> It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
<s> -- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
<s> When did you first find out he was alive?
<s> Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
<s> But what about us?
<s> Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
<s> Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> We'll discuss it later.
<s> Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
<s> I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
<s> You're saying this only to make me go.
<s> Any time.
<s> I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
<s> Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
<s> All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
<s> I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
<s> This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
<s> Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
<s> We'll be there.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
<s> If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
<s> Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
<s> How do you do, Mr. Rick?
<s> But everybody's having such a good time.
<s> Why? What's in Lisbon?
<s> Perhaps not.
<s> Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
<s> Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
<s> Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
<s> That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
<s> Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
<s> Yeah? Why?
<s> What friend?
<s> You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
<s> Oh, he won't be followed here.
<s> You think of everything, don't you?
<s> Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
<s> Sacha, she's had enough.
<s> In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
<s> Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
<s> I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
<s> Put it down!
<s> Well, what makes you think I haven't?
<s> For how long?
<s> No.
<s> Shut up and go home, will you?
<s> Just a little something of my own.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Worse than Warsaw.
<s> You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
<s> They're on autopilot.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
<s> Okay.  Sure.
<s> Possible.  So you did those wings?
<s> They're harder to do than they look.
<s> Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
<s> Sure.
<s> I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
<s> Let's take a look.
<s> Cold.
<s> I thought I did.
<s> Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
<s> You can't go now.
<s> Could you watch Jango?
<s> I can't take him to work.
<s> Hey...hey...it's okay!
<s> I thought you might have.
<s> My epitaph.
<s> Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
<s> Great.  Really.
<s> It means a lot...that you came.
<s> You too.
<s> You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
<s> Let's eat.
<s> So did I.
<s> Don't you even think about it.
<s> Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
<s> Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
<s> What about the sender?
<s> What's going on down there?
<s> Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
<s> It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
<s> I braided them.
<s> I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
<s> What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
<s> Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
<s> Deep, real deep.
<s> I need to do it.
<s> Life is waiting.
<s> "An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
<s> Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
<s> Dr. Homer Wells.
<s> Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
<s> She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
<s> If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
<s> Candy. Candy Kendall.
<s> No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
<s> When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
<s> I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
<s> She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
<s> I never *asked* for any responsibility.
<s> Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
<s> Right.
<s> Nothing.
<s> *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
<s> Please don't...
<s> She knows how to take care of herself.
<s> Sure. Thanks.
<s> I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
<s> How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
<s> She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
<s> Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
<s> Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
<s> Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
<s> We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
<s> Actually, I volunteered.
<s> What about the trees?
<s> I guess so...
<s> Is it true?
<s> You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
<s> Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
<s> And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
<s> Okay. Then you can be of use.
<s> Where'd she get you?
<s> We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
<s> I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
<s> Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
<s> Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
<s> Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
<s> I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
<s> Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
<s> You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
<s> Why was he missing for twenty days?
<s> They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
<s> Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
<s> Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
<s> Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
<s> *You* taught her, I suppose...
<s> You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
<s> Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
<s> A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
<s> And you have this letter of intent?
<s> The standard ten.
<s> Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
<s> It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
<s> And these cops? What do they get?
<s> You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
<s> You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
<s> So what? We hide, right?
<s> I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
<s> I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
<s> I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
<s> Two million.
<s> How's that? He works for Gillette.
<s> You sure?
<s> Eight A.M. flight.
<s> I can't do that.
<s> No. Just confidence.
<s> I said take off your fucking shirt.
<s> I think I just broke my hand.
<s> All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
<s> Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
<s> Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
<s> My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
<s> Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
<s> Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
<s> Glenn talked you out of it.
<s> Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
<s> What?
<s> You sure?
<s> There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
<s> Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
<s> Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
<s> HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
<s> We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
<s> I try.
<s> I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
<s> Roger that.
<s> You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
<s> No. Thanks.
<s> Why did you quit?
<s> You called the casino a cesspit.
<s> I despise the job.
<s> Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
<s> Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
<s> You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
<s> You want me drunk?
<s> I. sold the car.
<s> I've got something to tell you.
<s> There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
<s> You've got such beautiful hands.
<s> I'll see you in my dreams.
<s> I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
<s> It's the truth.
<s> Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
<s> It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
<s> Gambling's not about money.
<s> There was a message, wasn't there?
<s> I hate public transport.
<s> You know where I'm from?
<s> First visit to London?
<s> I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
<s> In the casino.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> I'll watch.
<s> Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
<s> It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
<s> Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
<s> And I thought you were a bright woman.
<s> Let it go.
<s> Well, life's not fair. We know that.
<s> The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
<s> Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
<s> Have I?
<s> And what do you do, Lucy?
<s> Are you going to put a spell on me?
<s> Too much. Eighteen hundred.
<s> Turn left at the lights.
<s> Over the river.
<s> Nice car.
<s> How long have you worked at the casino?
<s> What the fuck are you talking about?
<s> I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
<s> Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
<s> Has he?
<s> Do you have a Salon Prive?
<s> We check every four days.
<s> It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
<s> Give me 365.
<s> Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
<s> Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
<s> A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
<s> Look, bomb...
<s> I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
<s> Oh, God...
<s> Well, it is kind of a long shot...
<s> Well, there's the possibility of...
<s> Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
<s> Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
<s> Check at six minutes.
<s> Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
<s> Armed.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> Bomb?
<s> I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> Of course.
<s> I am always receptive to suggestions.
<s> Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
<s> All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
<s> Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
<s> To explode, of course.
<s> Yes, well...
<s> Doolittle...
<s> I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
<s> What?
<s> Who cares. Don't bother me.
<s> Fred.
<s> Ah, negative drop.
<s> -- Remark.
<s> Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
<s> I'm getting something here, on this readout...
<s> Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
<s> Not now!
<s> No kidding?
<s> Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
<s> Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
<s> Sorry.
<s> No?
<s> Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
<s> You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
<s> None of your business.
<s> Leave.  Now.
<s> And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
<s> It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
<s> No way.
<s> Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
<s> Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
<s> I don't get involved with guns.
<s> It's a rule.
<s> Every week.
<s> SHHH!  Don't do that!
<s> I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
<s> Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
<s> When?
<s> First time I ever heard that.
<s> The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
<s> Can we go somewhere and talk?
<s> Wasn't that hard.
<s> Lauren's not my wife.
<s> Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
<s> People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
<s> You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
<s> That would be appropriate, yes.
<s> Yes on all counts.
<s> You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
<s> No, I meant this.
<s> He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
<s> The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
<s> Hardly...
<s> She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
<s> On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
<s> I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
<s> Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
<s> You're crazy.
<s> You and me both.
<s> Straight.
<s> You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
<s> He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
<s> Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
<s> Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
<s> Where?
<s> But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
<s> I actually know how this works.
<s> What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
<s> Pull the cash.
<s> She's gonna want to hear for herself.
<s> Tell everybody hey.
<s> I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
<s> Max--
<s> But there's another side--
<s> She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
<s> You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
<s> How'd you get her out of town?
<s> I'll give it my best shot.
<s> You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
<s> He's sick.
<s> How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
<s> I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
<s> He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
<s> Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
<s> Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
<s> Bye.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
<s> Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
<s> Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
<s> Nah. Couldn't be.
<s> Oh, yeah...?
<s> I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
<s> They're what?
<s> Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
<s> Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
<s> Go ahead, Jam.
<s> You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
<s> You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
<s> I said, I'm sorry!
<s> I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
<s> You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
<s> Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
<s> Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
<s> Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
<s> It's not nearly enough, punk.
<s> No, you gimme your gun, boy!
<s> Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
<s> Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
<s> Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
<s> -- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
<s> So... that's it?
<s> If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
<s> I didn't say shit.
<s> What did you say?
<s> I can do anything I want... and so can you...
<s> Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
<s> It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
<s> We went to a hotel.
<s> Hey...
<s> You mean soap?
<s> Wonder where we'll be then.
<s> No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
<s> No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
<s> Why not just buy your baby a night light?
<s> With, like, images?
<s> No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
<s> What?
<s> Who?
<s> Maybe she's asleep.
<s> Infant Memory Generators.
<s> The whole movie. Let's go.
<s> Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
<s> No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
<s> I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
<s> So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
<s> You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
<s> I know, Dad.
<s> Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
<s> I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
<s> I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
<s> How so?
<s> I met a girl.
<s> Gretchen. We're going together now.
<s> It reminded me of my dog Callie.
<s> No. That makes you keep searching.
<s> The good stuff.
<s> Yes.
<s> I... I was playing with fire.
<s> But you were punished.
<s> What else makes you feel regret?
<s> It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
<s> Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> Okay, but it has to be a small one.
<s> That's enough.
<s> What else?
<s> Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
<s> You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
<s> Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
<s> She's right over there.
<s> Don't let that worry you, Annette!
<s> My mom wanted me to have this?
<s> Thank God for bunge cords.
<s> Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
<s> Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
<s> "Here," wh-wh-what?
<s> No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
<s> No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
<s> Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
<s> Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
<s> Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
<s> Bitch!
<s> Here, have some.
<s> Hi.
<s> I know.
<s> Hi.
<s> I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
<s> Shut it up, Loretta.
<s> "Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
<s> I'll be right back. See ya later.
<s> She's the winner and we're going to state.
<s> My dress'll reek.
<s> Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
<s> Gladys! Stop it!
<s> That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
<s> We need more bars!
<s> Enid ate a whole pan!
<s> Harold!
<s> I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
<s> English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
<s> We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
<s> "My dear"...
<s> "My dear"...
<s> "My dear President"...
<s> He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
<s> I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
<s> Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
<s> You was insulted, but you don't know it.
<s> She did.
<s> I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
<s> By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
<s> We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
<s> Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
<s> Sure.
<s> The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
<s> You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
<s> Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
<s> $50?
<s> Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
<s> You upstart!
<s> Yes.
<s> I still like UPSTART the best.
<s> Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
<s> No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
<s> You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
<s> Now -- er --
<s> Take a seat -- you're next. 
<s> That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
<s> WHAT  ?
<s> That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
<s> Perhaps he will listen to you...
<s> Yes please, two.
<s> If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
<s> I'll join you shortly.
<s> No, I think a whiskey.
<s> He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
<s> I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
<s> Did you see it?
<s> What is it?
<s> I intend to.
<s> He fell.  He falls.
<s> Just a moment, how did you get in here?
<s> He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
<s> Right... Right.
<s> Good morning, sir.
<s> No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
<s> Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
<s> Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
<s> And what was that, John?
<s> Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
<s> Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
<s> I am very pleased to meet you.
<s> Three quarters of an hour.
<s> You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
<s> No, but I certainly shall.
<s> I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
<s> y-y-yes--
<s> Oh no, my friend...
<s> Thank you... very much.
<s> The main spire.
<s> Say "Mmmerrick."
<s> Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
<s> I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
<s> Oh, our relatives... the children.
<s> Yes, John?
<s> Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
<s> Yes.
<s> There is one more thing, John. Here.
<s> Oh yes! It was wonderful!
<s> You too, my friend. Goodnight.
<s> No, he's very upset about something.
<s> I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
<s> Ah! It's my father!
<s> You're losing your temper!
<s> Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
<s> Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
<s> HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
<s> I've never been to bed with anybody!
<s> "The fifth one this week"!
<s> And I thought you said it was something special...
<s> But, Erik...
<s> I'll bring it back.
<s> No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
<s> Goodbye, Aud...
<s> I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
<s> Of course.
<s> The second note to wake the Gods...
<s> Not quite...
<s> We blew the Horn Resounding.
<s> That I cannot tell you.
<s> Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
<s> No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
<s> And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
<s> Yes?
<s> You've got to let me go!
<s> They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
<s> Yes... oh, yes...
<s> The important thing is not to panic.
<s> Oh, get it over with.
<s> You DON'T like it, do you?
<s> Well you started it.
<s> What a stupid idea.
<s> You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
<s> I don't know! I just did!
<s> But...
<s> Come on, move it!
<s> No.
<s> Don't you FEEL it?
<s> What's it all about?
<s> Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
<s> Row! Row! Row!
<s> Look out!
<s> We don't HAVE to help anybody.
<s> No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
<s> Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
<s> Well, come on!
<s> Like fish.
<s> To the oars!
<s> Oh... I feel a little... oh...
<s> I've got you!
<s> Who gets killed?
<s> Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
<s> What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
<s> It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
<s> Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
<s> DEATH!
<s> She MUST have a knife or something...
<s> I have to go...
<s> What do we have to do?
<s> No, it is NOT.
<s> Your lord.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
<s> Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
<s> That's right.
<s> Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
<s> How can we stops him now?
<s> Help!
<s> DEATH TO DRAGONS!
<s> I told you that later.
<s> Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
<s> Okay, I guess.
<s> I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
<s> I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
<s> In the room?
<s> Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
<s> Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
<s> You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
<s> My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
<s> It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
<s> Yeah?
<s> What?
<s> You pick it.
<s> No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
<s> I know a man who needs a refill.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
<s> I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
<s> Yes.
<s> Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
<s> You didn't say anything about my hair.
<s> Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
<s> No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
<s> You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
<s> Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
<s> Really? Is he cute?
<s> Egad, were you horrified?
<s> But you weren't. I could tell.
<s> Okay.
<s> I remember that speech really well.
<s> You had the whole human race pegged.
<s> I know.
<s> Seems too coincidental that way.
<s> I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
<s> What if?
<s> I'm nervous, too.
<s> Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Did you send this? Is it a joke?
<s> I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
<s> Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
<s> I'm like a joke to them.
<s> Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
<s> I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
<s> Very cool. Trippy.
<s> Hi.
<s> 'kay.
<s> I better do this, Stan.
<s> That's a good one.
<s> It's a good one all right.
<s> This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
<s> I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
<s> Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
<s> Thanks, Stan.
<s> Hi.
<s> I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
<s> Cole slaw, ice tea?
<s> That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> It's no big deal.
<s> We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
<s> I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
<s> She came to help, Howard.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Just wanted to let you know.
<s> She was unconscious, Patrick.
<s> Jesus, Patrick!
<s> Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
<s> The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
<s> I'm staying with the Countess.
<s> Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
<s> FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
<s> 'Drugged' is a stupid word.
<s> It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
<s> She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
<s> Like what?
<s> I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
<s> Yep.
<s> Tired...
<s> A born freak can only go uphill.
<s> Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
<s> Bonanza Jellybean?
<s> A job for me?
<s> Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
<s> Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
<s> I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
<s> Coop, where are you...
<s> I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
<s> What about the accumulator...?
<s> What?
<s> I'm telling you, I saw it...
<s> His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
<s> Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
<s> Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
<s> Oh God...
<s> Nothing. It's nothing.
<s> I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
<s> I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
<s> Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
<s> Negative.
<s> It's complicated...
<s> Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
<s> Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
<s> I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
<s> Son of a bitch!
<s> What makes you think I'll miss?
<s> I'm not the Devil.
<s> Starck... Cooper...
<s> Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
<s> That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
<s> That's enough!
<s> No, no, we just got her back together...
<s> Justin?
<s> Let's go.
<s> What about the life readings you picked up?
<s> So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
<s> Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
<s> What is it, Starck?
<s> There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
<s> Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
<s> What's going on in there, Starck?
<s> Five seconds.
<s> Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
<s> We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
<s> DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
<s> They're explosive charges.
<s> The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
<s> Picking up magnetic interference.
<s> Ship's log.
<s> I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
<s> Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
<s> The forward airlock.
<s> Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
<s> Relax, it's casual.
<s> Is it safe?
<s> The suit will stretch. You should try it --
<s> Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
<s> What is this? Where's Reed?
<s> Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
<s> I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
<s> Deb, it's me. It's still me.
<s> Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
<s> External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
<s> Victor's better at these things.
<s> Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
<s> Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
<s> Put your tiny little mind at ease.
<s> They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
<s> I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
<s> What do you mean "complete"?
<s> I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
<s> Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<s> The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
<s> Oh, it is.
<s> Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
<s> Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
<s> Okay, "mom."
<s> You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
<s> It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
<s> Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
<s> What? What do you mean you --
<s> Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
<s> What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
<s> I think it was a little more complicated than --
<s> And reverse the mutations --
<s> He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
<s> Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
<s> I'm sure I can come up with something.
<s> You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
<s> The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
<s> Reed, we're running out of time.
<s> It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<s> Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
<s> I understand the business reasons.
<s> Susan. What are you doing?
<s> Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
<s> For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
<s> Totally.
<s> Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
<s> Manager!!
<s> Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
<s> Where did you hear that?
<s> No.
<s> They were left over from the last shift.
<s> Okay, Dennis.
<s> What a guy.
<s> I know what I look like.
<s> Well...
<s> Let's continue.
<s> I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
<s> I know it's yours.
<s> We've got to get an abortion?
<s> You should work for yourself.
<s> What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
<s> She's in my biology class.
<s> No. It's too soon.
<s> You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
<s> I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
<s> It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
<s> Damone! You come here?
<s> Really.
<s> I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
<s> You're crazy. Those girls love me.
<s> Whatever you say, Rat.
<s> So what makes you so sensitive?
<s> Yes.
<s> He was hot, wasn't he?
<s> Believe it.
<s> What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
<s> What's the big deal?
<s> It was nice.
<s> Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
<s> Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
<s> Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
<s> You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
<s> Climax together.
<s> I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
<s> You're right. I didn't tell you that.
<s> He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
<s> What class?
<s> Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
<s> I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
<s> That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
<s> I don't know. I guess so.
<s> No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
<s> Aloha, Spicoli.
<s> I don't know. Wherever you want.
<s> We keep them.
<s> We keep them, in case the people come back.
<s> My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
<s> Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
<s> Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
<s> John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
<s> I'll get you the notes.
<s> Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
<s> IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
<s> Tell me. What do you want?
<s> Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
<s> WHAT?
<s> A major!
<s> Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
<s> Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
<s> My heart!
<s> The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
<s> No, no. Don't leave me!
<s> I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
<s> Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
<s> GO?
<s> How about a check?
<s> You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
<s> It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
<s> In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
<s> You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
<s> Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
<s> Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
<s> Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
<s> Of course, officer.
<s> Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
<s> You and a lot of other people.
<s> Her fella.
<s> I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
<s> Who the hell would you call?
<s> We're lucky to be alive.
<s> Where's that?
<s> If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
<s> And the rest of 'em?
<s> This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
<s> In the corner, behind the curtain.
<s> The door... on three.
<s> Just an observation.
<s> Who's with me?
<s> He's dead.
<s> My truck.
<s> Yep.
<s> We lived near power lines.
<s> We gotta try.
<s> What?
<s> Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
<s> What's in the back?
<s> Just cover me. It was built to move.
<s> Sure.
<s> He only shot you once.
<s> No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
<s> Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
<s> Covered.
<s> What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
<s> I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
<s> They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
<s> What the hell's going on here!?
<s> I'm fine! I'm fine!
<s> REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
<s> HELLLLLLLLP!!
<s> BONSAI!
<s> As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
<s> Stop her!
<s> I'd love to.
<s> Um, well...
<s> Well...
<s> Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
<s> I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
<s> Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
<s> But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
<s> Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
<s> I'm not!
<s> What?
<s> He's not here.
<s> Sort of.
<s> ...Yes.
<s> Dick, we need some time apart --
<s> I gotta go now.
<s> All square, Doc.
<s> Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
<s> He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
<s> Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
<s> Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
<s> I don't care, Dad. I love you.
<s> Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
<s> Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
<s> No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
<s> Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
<s> Why, you... you little bastard!
<s> You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
<s> Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
<s> I just wanted to see how you looked.
<s> Enh.
<s> You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
<s> Kaminski.
<s> They killed him. They threw him out that window.
<s> Eight stories.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
<s> It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
<s> I took the early rounds.
<s> No, Harry, I can't -- 
<s> You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
<s> What?
<s> Whattaya think you're in now?
<s> Huh?
<s> Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
<s> ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
<s> Yeah. I don't know.
<s> It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
<s> Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
<s> Fine!
<s> Who're you?
<s> I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
<s> 'Golden Boy.'
<s> I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
<s> Yes, Ma.
<s> Smile, little sister, smile.
<s> You kill me, Mama.
<s> Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
<s> Yes, Mama.
<s> Mama...?
<s> You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
<s> You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
<s> And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
<s> I will, I promise.
<s> Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
<s> Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
<s> And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
<s> No!
<s> Yes.
<s> The music? Or the fire?
<s> People can be kinder than you think.
<s> How did you find me?
<s> Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
<s> Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
<s> She's not for you.
<s> Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
<s> It's been months. It's not like him.
<s> He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
<s> Nothing can. Not ever.
<s> He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
<s> All my life I've known.
<s> Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
<s> If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
<s> A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
<s> Aye, Captain.
<s> Very well then.
<s> You're a comfort to me, Henry.
<s> It's a letter to my father.
<s> He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
<s> Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
<s> It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
<s> Everything in moderation, Clerval.
<s> Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
<s> Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
<s> Despite the lack of challenge.
<s> You disdain accepted wisdom?
<s> I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
<s> I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
<s> No, no, they're all dead...
<s> I will protect you.
<s> I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
<s> I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
<s> I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
<s> It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
<s> Almost five.
<s> Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
<s> Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
<s> I'll go take a look.
<s> Do you have a dime? A quarter?
<s> Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
<s> I meant everything.
<s> Somebody'll see.
<s> I'll spot you five points.
<s> Where's Ned?
<s> Dancer.
<s> Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
<s> I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
<s> Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
<s> No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
<s> They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
<s> Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
<s> Have you ever been there before?
<s> Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
<s> I said new, this is an '90.
<s> They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
<s> They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
<s> He's running the show.
<s> To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
<s> He's my son.
<s> Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
<s> Come again?
<s> That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
<s> Scott and Kate.
<s> I was a minister.
<s> I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
<s> Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
<s> Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
<s> Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
<s> Pass.
<s> I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
<s> I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
<s> You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
<s> You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
<s> It's a flop house.
<s> If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
<s> No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
<s> We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
<s> What's in Mexico?
<s> You asked me if I would --
<s> The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
<s> You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
<s> Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
<s> Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
<s> Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
<s> -- you got your microwave --
<s> What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
<s> He signaled the Ranger.
<s> They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, Seth, I understand.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, I think so. What happened?
<s> What?
<s> When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
<s> That's how you're lookin', Richie.
<s> Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
<s> Thank you, ensign.
<s> Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
<s> Don't say my name.
<s> "Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
<s> I'm fine, sir.
<s> Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
<s> Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
<s> Didn't take long.
<s> Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
<s> This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
<s> Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
<s> Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
<s> I'm sure it is.
<s> You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
<s> Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
<s> Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
<s> What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
<s> I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
<s> Is this my glory, sir?
<s> Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
<s> This has nothing to do with you.
<s> You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
<s> It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
<s> Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
<s> It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
<s> What?
<s> That's a good story.
<s> He was married?
<s> You got anybody, Wick?
<s> Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
<s> Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
<s> Just askin'
<s> Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
<s> McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
<s> Sure.  Just like your men do.
<s> Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
<s> Show us where you are, Chief.
<s> Your new roommate.
<s> Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
<s> FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
<s> So am I.
<s> The first female President?
<s> Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
<s> All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
<s> You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
<s> Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
<s> Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
<s> It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
<s> Only one way to find out.
<s> But we can get to the west side faster.
<s> When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
<s> I got pretty close.
<s> I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
<s> So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
<s> Really? I'd like to find out.
<s> Speak of the devil.
<s> Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Five bucks.
<s> This is not the place...
<s> He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
<s> Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
<s> Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
<s> More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
<s> We know.
<s> Yeah, you're the worm guy.
<s> You're standing on it.
<s> Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
<s> What are you suggesting?
<s> Last time you didn't even scratch it!
<s> Oh.
<s> Sure.
<s> You were right.
<s> Good idea.
<s> I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
<s> It's Raymond.
<s> Well good, that's very... nice.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Quellek. What are you doing in there?
<s> I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
<s> COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
<s> You go first! There's no time!
<s> That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
<s> Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
<s> I had the shot...
<s> No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
<s> No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
<s> The engines are dead. We're drifting.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Dear God.... How did I come to this?
<s> I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
<s> Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
<s> FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
<s> Down there.
<s> Excuse me guys.
<s> Okay, that's where you want to be.
<s> Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
<s> Up.
<s> Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
<s> So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
<s> You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
<s> Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
<s> I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
<s> Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
<s> You... know us?
<s> Something BAD happened here.
<s> We're doing episode 31, Jason?
<s> All right. Put me back on with him.
<s> We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
<s> Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
<s> We're doing episode 31?
<s> Where'd they go? Back inside?
<s> We made it. Commander, we made it.'
<s> How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
<s> One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
<s> Will you stop RIDING ME?!
<s> Gwen...
<s> Almost as much as he loves himself.
<s> I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
<s> Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
<s> Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
<s> Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
<s> Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
<s> Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
<s> It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
<s> But... Inside, I have seen-
<s> And determination.
<s> Wh... Where are we?
<s> Why don't you just turn it on and see?
<s> Oh god...
<s> Patience, Lt. . Patience.
<s> But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
<s> Because they're coming right at us.
<s> You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
<s> Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
<s> But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
<s> Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
<s> It is.
<s> Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
<s> Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
<s> I?  You all know my history.
<s> Same old story.
<s> You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
<s> None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
<s> Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
<s> Yes, general.
<s> Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
<s> That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
<s> And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
<s> We better, Congress invented him.
<s> Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
<s> But it's more than just that, am I right?
<s> As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
<s> You invented this, this...
<s> The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
<s> Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
<s> What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
<s> Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
<s> I... they look both the same.
<s> I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
<s> I only meant...
<s> Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
<s> When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
<s> War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
<s> When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
<s> Martha!  For God's sake!
<s> We're leaving them?
<s> Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
<s> Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
<s> You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
<s> I will not betray you, Nathanael.
<s> I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
<s> I'd throw everything away for you.
<s> Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
<s> Africa, of course.
<s> What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
<s> That land belongs to the strongest.
<s> Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
<s> This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
<s> Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
<s> An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
<s> Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
<s> I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
<s> Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
<s> Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
<s> No. What's this?
<s> You're right.
<s> No shit? What're some of 'em?
<s> Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
<s> That's right, me.
<s> Yeah, we're getting Martin.
<s> Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
<s> What about her?
<s> There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
<s> That's all.
<s> What money?
<s> I don't believe this.
<s> It's a different kind of deal.
<s> You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
<s> You serious?
<s> Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
<s> Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
<s> Who?
<s> Or else use your fucking imagination.
<s> Ray Barboni. From Miami.
<s> Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
<s> That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
<s> What've you got?
<s> Where you been, Harry?
<s> We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
<s> You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
<s> You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
<s> Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
<s> I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
<s> The shylock's the good guy.
<s> Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
<s> So you don't work for the casino?
<s> Maybe a few times I have.
<s> Harry, look at me.
<s> Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
<s> I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
<s> But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
<s> Read it. It's a grabber.
<s> They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
<s> Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
<s> You have it?
<s> Ask your man here.
<s> A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
<s> Like this?
<s> Wait. How about this?
<s> You're not going to tell me the rest?
<s> Compass.
<s> Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
<s> How much is the wife offered?
<s> Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
<s> Don't go out of your way.
<s> I want to know.
<s> Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
<s> Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
<s> He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
<s> I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
<s> Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
<s> You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
<s> I'm thinking about producing.
<s> Come on in.
<s> Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
<s> You seem to feel fine about it.
<s> No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
<s> You don't? What happened to Muff?
<s> Oh, yeah, sure.
<s> He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
<s> Shylock?
<s> What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
<s> Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
<s> Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
<s> With that coxswain dickhead.
<s> That's what it says.
<s> Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
<s> I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
<s> I don't know. Tuesday?
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Bring it on, dude.
<s> Or uninvited guests.
<s> I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
<s> I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
<s> The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
<s> I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
<s> What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
<s> What, you think there's something funny about it?
<s> Then it happened before they scuttled her.
<s> We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
<s> You smashed it!
<s> You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
<s> Right.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
<s> Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
<s> I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
<s> Yeah. Thanks.
<s> Did you see him?
<s> If it was a ship she hit.
<s> I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
<s> That much I think we've already established.
<s> Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
<s> Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
<s> Maybe it was more than that.
<s> I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
<s> I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
<s> You got that right.
<s> Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
<s> Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
<s> Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
<s> Lost my sea legs.
<s> You don't remember?
<s> Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
<s> Who?
<s> God, how horrifying.
<s> I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
<s> Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
<s> Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
<s> Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
<s> Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
<s> Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
<s> It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
<s> I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
<s> I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
<s> Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
<s> Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
<s> SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
<s> Oh my God, that's HIM!
<s> But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
<s> Why?
<s> Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
<s> Then why do you hate me so much?
<s> You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
<s> Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
<s> Or maybe not.
<s> Okay, okay!
<s> God, it's so totally pathetic.
<s> You loser!
<s> I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
<s> Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
<s> I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
<s> I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
<s> What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
<s> He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
<s> I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
<s> Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
<s> We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
<s> Where did you get that?
<s> No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
<s> Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
<s> I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
<s> We were such desperate sluts back then.
<s> God, you're really obsessed...
<s> I can't imagine spending money on towels.
<s> What thing?
<s> Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
<s> Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
<s> Nothing.
<s> I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
<s> Great...
<s> I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
<s> That's all you're bringing?
<s> Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
<s> I know it's over, asshole, I --
<s> Hey, where are you going?
<s> Well why do I care about that?
<s> Sure, I guess.
<s> The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
<s> You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
<s> I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
<s> Jesus!
<s> I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
<s> I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
<s> Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
<s> PLEASE? We have to!
<s> These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
<s> Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
<s> But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
<s> It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
<s> Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
<s> What? Why?
<s> Really?
<s> Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
<s> Why?
<s> Hi, it's me...
<s> What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
<s> Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
<s> I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
<s> I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
<s> What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
<s> What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
<s> What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
<s> How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
<s> I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
<s> Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
<s> Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
<s> Starling?
<s> Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
<s> You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
<s> -is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
<s> We have hunted since childhood.
<s> And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
<s> We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
<s> Shhh.
<s> What did I do?
<s> All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
<s> You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
<s> What happened to them?
<s> The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
<s> Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
<s> Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
<s> This is more difficult-
<s> Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
<s> You- they cannot believe you're still here.
<s> You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
<s> Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
<s> Once... 
<s> Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
<s> No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
<s> I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
<s> Does he ever mention me?
<s> I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
<s> Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
<s> Okay, that's no problem.
<s> We definitely had a moment or two.
<s> Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
<s> Peter, what about the bathtub?
<s> Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
<s> Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
<s> Finally came to your senses, huh?
<s> A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
<s> Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
<s> Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
<s> No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
<s> Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
<s> Command me, lord.
<s> Yes, the scourge --
<s> I await the word of Vigo.
<s> Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
<s> Do I?
<s> I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
<s> Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
<s> I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
<s> Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
<s> They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
<s> I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
<s> Something good --
<s> I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
<s> Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
<s> Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
<s> It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
<s> This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
<s> We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
<s> Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
<s> The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
<s> Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
<s> Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
<s> I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
<s> I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
<s> And decent.
<s> To the bathroom, where do you think?
<s> No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
<s> Hi, Louis.
<s> Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
<s> Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
<s> Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
<s> I told you, I ...
<s> I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
<s> Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
<s> I want you inside me.
<s> Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
<s> No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
<s> He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
<s> Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
<s> We'll get back to you.
<s> I think it's the food of the future.
<s> I don't believe in luck.
<s> The EPA?  What's he want?
<s> In a storage facility.
<s> Yes, it would.
<s> See!  They are using drugs.
<s> Close -- but definitely wrong.
<s> Two wavy lines?
<s> I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
<s> Were you recently in the bathroom?
<s> What have you got, Egon?
<s> I agree.
<s> She said he was "the Destructor."
<s> No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
<s> I blame myself.
<s> Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
<s> I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
<s> That appears to be the case.
<s> Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
<s> No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
<s> Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
<s> What do we do now?
<s> Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
<s> Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
<s> It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
<s> Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
<s> No sense worrying about it now.
<s> So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
<s> I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
<s> What?  What popped in there?
<s> Judgement Day ...
<s> Why not do it in the Colosseum?
<s> Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
<s> If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
<s> You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
<s> Not yet, dear brother...
<s> Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
<s> Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
<s> At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
<s> Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
<s> I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
<s> Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
<s> You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
<s> You're hearing about somebody else.
<s> Why you?
<s> Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
<s> Sneaking around with your brother?
<s> Why do you play at being drunk?
<s> For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
<s> He killed his father and then my family...
<s> Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
<s> They fear me.
<s> Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
<s> I was summoned.
<s> Greeks?
<s> They're studying with Cynics.
<s> Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
<s> I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
<s> General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
<s> Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
<s> Chain him.
<s> What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
<s> As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
<s> Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
<s> Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
<s> Right, right, what am I thinking of?
<s> You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
<s> I want nothing to do with the arena.
<s> Hello.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
<s> No.
<s> Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
<s> Because I want to know what's happening.
<s> Get out of here.
<s> No.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Did you say rape her?
<s> What did she say?
<s> All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
<s> The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
<s> No.
<s> I'll think about it.
<s> Why wouldn't it?
<s> I just don't think it would...
<s> Well -- I said I might marry him.
<s> No, Benjamin.
<s> Shhhh.
<s> Is the doctor anywhere?
<s> You heard me. Out of here.
<s> Yes.
<s> Could you bring it up?
<s> A single. Just for myself, please.
<s> What? No. Nothing.
<s> Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
<s> Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
<s> What do you drink?
<s> Why not?
<s> When is he coming back?
<s> What?
<s> Look -- I think I should be going --
<s> Like what?
<s> I know that. But I'm --
<s> I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
<s> Don't you think he trusts us together?
<s> Where is it?
<s> Waiter!
<s> Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
<s> What?
<s> You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
<s> Isn't there something you want to tell me?
<s> I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
<s> What?
<s> This is all terribly wrong.
<s> That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
<s> I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
<s> What?
<s> Thank you.
<s> No we don't.
<s> On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
<s> Is it?
<s> Don't tell Elaine.
<s> Yes.
<s> We'd go to his car.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> I see.
<s> Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
<s> Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
<s> May I stay then?
<s> Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
<s> But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
<s> Where is Elaine?
<s> Very good, sir.
<s> Yes, but I'm afraid --
<s> I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
<s> No, I do. I want to tell you.
<s> What else?
<s> Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
<s> Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
<s> I do.
<s> We haven't.
<s> What about it?
<s> No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
<s> That's a hell of a good age to be.
<s> Quite a while.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'd like to hear it.
<s> Oh no.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
<s> No, it's not --
<s> Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
<s> I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
<s> Can you look through the glass.
<s> Yes, I can.
<s> Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
<s> It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
<s> Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
<s> Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
<s> Well?
<s> The pearls are in her room.
<s> I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
<s> No.
<s> I could take care of her.
<s> You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
<s> With the pearls?
<s> You might find a bullet through that head...
<s> Not with strangers.
<s> No -- why? -- should I?
<s> Money -- Ever heard of it?
<s> Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
<s> All right. We'll dance.
<s> Sorry.
<s> I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
<s> Yes --
<s> For tonight. 
<s> No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
<s> How tired you are!
<s> I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
<s> I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
<s> That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
<s> I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
<s> Oh -- 
<s> Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
<s> I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
<s> I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
<s> Yes -- yes -- yes.
<s> For Vienna?
<s> They've brought me such good luck -- you --
<s> Yes -- I will be on the train.
<s> Bless you --
<s> Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
<s> Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
<s> Yes, quite.
<s> No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
<s> Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
<s> Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
<s> All of that at once, Baron?
<s> Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
<s> I did not ask your advice.
<s> We shall see who remains here the longer.
<s> No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
<s> Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
<s> No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
<s> No, Doctor.
<s> The Grand Hotel.
<s> Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
<s> Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
<s> For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
<s> Everything?
<s> No.
<s> Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
<s> You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
<s> Oh -- what -- what -- 
<s> Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
<s> Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
<s> My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
<s> Well -- you want me?
<s> Well?
<s> A thousand marks -- 
<s> We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
<s> Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
<s> I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
<s> Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
<s> He likes to play the great man.
<s> But, Madam. cannot do that.
<s> The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
<s> Good morning, Madam.
<s> Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
<s> I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
<s> I wish to be alone.
<s> Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
<s> Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
<s> An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
<s> -- We must do something...
<s> Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
<s> Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
<s> Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
<s> You are late. Hurry.
<s> No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
<s> Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
<s> I want to keep my teeth.
<s> My son was in the hospital --
<s> I'll loan you a raincoat.
<s> Oh, thanks, Bobo.
<s> Roy? He's always crying.
<s> Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
<s> Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
<s> Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
<s> So here we are!
<s> We're not really interested, Henry.
<s> One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
<s> These machines -- They're in here.
<s> I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
<s> My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
<s> What is?
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
<s> You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
<s> No. And you have to be.
<s> Get off the grift, Roy.
<s> Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
<s> Well, that's good news.
<s> Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
<s> Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
<s> You must have some money.
<s> And Myra's stuff?
<s> You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
<s> Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
<s> I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
<s> I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
<s> I know you do, so that's why --
<s> Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
<s> I don't see why not.
<s> Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
<s> ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
<s> You're too young. You should be in school.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I want to know everything about you.
<s> I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
<s> That's just Lilly's way.
<s> You ain't seen nothin.
<s> You already went back to work.
<s> The long end. Big con.
<s> I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
<s> Where?
<s> Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
<s> Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
<s> Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
<s> For Christ's sake, why not?
<s> Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
<s> Not many.
<s> It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
<s> Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
<s> Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
<s> Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
<s> ... I think it would be best if you both left.
<s> Nothing's missing?
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> Forget it.
<s> I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
<s> No.
<s> I was trying to protect you from this...
<s> Get on the bus.
<s> John, you can't help her now.
<s> John...
<s> Call me Laurie, will ya?
<s> Where'd you get it?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
<s> Okay... thank you.
<s> Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
<s> You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
<s> You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
<s> Shit, Linda!
<s> Where's Shane?
<s> Have enough fun for the both of us.
<s> He's in the bathroom.
<s> Then they can watch.
<s> What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
<s> Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
<s> Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
<s> I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
<s> Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
<s> I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
<s> You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
<s> Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
<s> Samhain.
<s> Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
<s> Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
<s> I'm gonna wet my pants.
<s> Must have changed that law.
<s> At least!
<s> Tell them yourself!
<s> The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
<s> The hell with the diamonds!
<s> Go home!
<s> You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
<s> You know me, boy.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> When?
<s> Oh.  I'd forgotten.
<s> Really?
<s> I dunno.
<s> Tit for tat--as simple as that.
<s> Maybe it's time you got out.
<s> Goodbye, Looseleaf.
<s> It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
<s> I just want one true adventure before I die.
<s> It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
<s> To make an ass of yourself.
<s> It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
<s> You're hollow, like a woman.
<s> Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
<s> Where's Mom?
<s> He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
<s> They were in the same creative writing class.
<s> "The sting."
<s> Tell me that!  Tell me that!
<s> Go on.
<s> And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
<s> She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
<s> Penelope!
<s> No.
<s> I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
<s> Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
<s> Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
<s> Situation.
<s> A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
<s> You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
<s> He's a very decent man, Harold.
<s> I could carve a better man out of a banana!
<s> Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
<s> People don't use that word any more.
<s> I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
<s> I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
<s> It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
<s> About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
<s> I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
<s> Like what?
<s> With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
<s> I'm teaching my son to be a man.
<s> Oh dear.
<s> Ahh--then she's still alive.
<s> I came back.
<s> Are--are you crying, Penelope?
<s> Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
<s> Are you've seen it work cures?
<s> That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
<s> The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
<s> Oooooo.  That hurt.
<s> No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
<s> I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
<s> Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
<s> Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
<s> I dunno.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
<s> I don't want to live any more.
<s> I'll kill myself.
<s> He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
<s> You're married!  You've already got a husband!
<s> A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
<s> I didn't know that.
<s> Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
<s> Don't know.
<s> Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
<s> He isn't any friend of Father.
<s> Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
<s> That's when I'll get my confidence back.
<s> If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
<s> Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
<s> He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
<s> We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
<s> How long has this been going on?
<s> Marry me instead.
<s> Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
<s> Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
<s> I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
<s> He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
<s> I'm amazed.
<s> He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
<s> I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
<s> Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
<s> Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
<s> It's good.  Let him go.
<s> What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
<s> We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
<s> Pull out your cock.
<s> Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
<s> Are you going to stiff me?
<s> I said I just wanted to talk to you...
<s> How many weeks?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
<s> Yeah. How did you know?
<s> Too bad. I wasn't in it.
<s> I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
<s> Um-hm. Live sound.
<s> I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
<s> Huh?
<s> I don't drink, but you can go out.
<s> A friend.
<s> 'Sucking off.'
<s> You used to work at Copper Penny?
<s> No.
<s> Not very.
<s> T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
<s> Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
<s> Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
<s> ...What do you have to offer?
<s> Who's paying you?
<s> That's right.
<s> Mr. Van Dorn?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Do you think she's safe?
<s> You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
<s> Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
<s> I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
<s> What plan?
<s> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
<s> It was called 'Slave of Love.'
<s> Where is she? Where is the girl?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> Well...
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
<s> If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
<s> He asked me. You going with anybody?
<s> You never heard of that?
<s> I'm worried about Jake.
<s> Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
<s> You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
<s> No.
<s> Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
<s> I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
<s> None of that, lady.
<s> Possession of a stolen shovel.
<s> Then whose name is it registered in?
<s> Where are the papers?
<s> Wait here.
<s> Lady! Be quiet.
<s> Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
<s> I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
<s> I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
<s> A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
<s> I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
<s> What?
<s> And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
<s> It's very interesting.
<s> Maude???!
<s> Oh, it's fine. Fine.
<s> Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
<s> Really. Do you think it's wrong?
<s> That's really great.
<s> Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
<s> Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
<s> Well...
<s> What is that he's working on?
<s> It is kind of rough.
<s> Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
<s> No more revolts.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
<s> Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
<s> It's all right.  It's organic.
<s> What is it, Harold?
<s> Well, don't go.
<s> Really. Just put it there, Harold.
<s> Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
<s> We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
<s> They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
<s> You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
<s> Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
<s> I don't care what people say.
<s> Harold!
<s> Perhaps it is.
<s> No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
<s> No. My uncle.
<s> Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
<s> I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
<s> I go to funerals.
<s> No.
<s> Thank you, Uncle.
<s> Jeez! That's a great story,
<s> To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
<s> Well, I don't...
<s> Eh, yes, ma'm.
<s> Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
<s> Oh, yes. How did you like that?
<s> No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
<s> Julia.
<s> I know.
<s> She certainly has.
<s> What's the matter with her?
<s> God, that's terrible.
<s> Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
<s> Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
<s> The boxes! I TOLD you.
<s> No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
<s> Then why are you here?
<s> And what about you?
<s> No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
<s> It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
<s> The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
<s> Is he serious??
<s> You mean, outside... with her.
<s> I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
<s> Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
<s> I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
<s> I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
<s> I think that is its hand.
<s> Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
<s> Is it bad?
<s> Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
<s> Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
<s> I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
<s> Noooo! Noooo!!!
<s> Those things never work. Never.
<s> No. Don't --
<s> My arm is fine. Where are you??
<s> C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
<s> Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
<s> On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
<s> Alone?
<s> Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
<s> I like that...
<s> Cocky.
<s> Coffee's warming me up.
<s> Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
<s> Julia's my second wife.
<s> It's just a puzzle box.
<s> You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
<s> No.
<s> That's right. Who are you?
<s> I don't want to see the dress.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Who are you?
<s> What do you want me to do.
<s> So you were cheated.
<s> And the blood let you out?
<s> Yes. They'll never find us.
<s> Oh Christ. Julia...
<s> I cut myself.
<s> I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
<s> Shit.
<s> Sure.
<s> O.K.
<s> O.K.
<s> Kirsty.
<s> Fine.
<s> Please. I can't bear it...
<s> Not much.
<s> Just soda.
<s> There's a first time for everything.
<s> I... suppose so, yes.
<s> No. No. Let's go upstairs.
<s> Let's keep it that way, shall we?
<s> We don't need a bed, do we?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
<s> I got through.
<s> No Dad.
<s> What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
<s> O.K.
<s> Is Julia here?
<s> Really?
<s> What?
<s> Finished?
<s> So lie down.
<s> Please. I want to see you home. All right?
<s> If there's a train.
<s> We walk.
<s> Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
<s> As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
<s> What happened to you?
<s> Don't let them take me, Steve --
<s> I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
<s> I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
<s> Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
<s> Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
<s> "Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
<s> Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
<s> Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
<s> Ha.
<s> Haven't seen it.
<s> No way.
<s> We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
<s> That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
<s> They always seemed...
<s> You can be and are wrong.
<s> We work there!
<s> Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
<s> The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
<s> That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
<s> Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
<s> Yeah, sure...
<s> Can I help you?
<s> Fine.
<s> I understand, Dick.
<s> -- FUCK OFF!
<s> You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
<s> It's Vince and Justin.
<s> Maybe I should talk to him.
<s> Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
<s> Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
<s> I dunno.
<s> I thought I could give you a lift back.
<s> Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
<s> Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
<s> Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
<s> I think you know that.
<s> Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
<s> So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
<s> Fine.  One.
<s> Just ask it!
<s> We'll talk some other time.
<s> I guess.
<s> It's me.
<s> You still together?  Going all right?
<s> That bad, eh?
<s> I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
<s> No, no.  When are you going home?
<s> I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
<s> I'm too tired not to go out with you.
<s> Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
<s> Okay.
<s> You're tougher.
<s> Harder.
<s> Hi.  What are you doing?
<s> Wanna go to dinner?
<s> I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
<s> That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
<s> Barry?  Barry knows about this?
<s> That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
<s> I don't know.
<s> This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
<s> It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
<s> Hey.  It's Liz.
<s> Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
<s> It's true!
<s> Enough of what?
<s> Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
<s> Yes.  You?
<s> I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
<s> Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
<s> Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
<s> Sixty.
<s> Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
<s> Sure.
<s> Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
<s> Carl Smith.
<s> Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
<s> People like that rarely leave business cards.
<s> You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
<s> You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
<s> That bothers you?
<s> Go home.
<s> No one knows you're here?
<s> The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
<s> You are a very perceptive young woman.
<s> That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
<s> He knows about you.
<s> What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
<s> You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
<s> Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
<s> Will I see you again?
<s> You're an asshole, Moran.
<s> All I need is for you to check the name.
<s> Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
<s> Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
<s> You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
<s> I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
<s> Pheasant.
<s> This can't be.
<s> If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
<s> Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
<s> All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
<s> And you?
<s> I am not ready for this.
<s> What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
<s> Do what you must.
<s> Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
<s> If you wish to play games, Major.
<s> We have no understanding.
<s> Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
<s> I had no choice.
<s> We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
<s> Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
<s> Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
<s> How many came?
<s> And the Bulgarian?
<s> He knows I'm here.  How?
<s> Of sorts.
<s> Leave her alone.
<s> And if I refuse?
<s> It doesn't.
<s> American.
<s> No.
<s> What's the idea of locking this?
<s> Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
<s> That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
<s> I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
<s> Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
<s> I lost my wallet.
<s> Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
<s> No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
<s> Oh.
<s> Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
<s> I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
<s> You haven't seen anything yet.
<s> Thanks a lot.
<s> Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
<s> You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
<s> You'll ask me to what?
<s> Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
<s> Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
<s> Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
<s> Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
<s> I have a lunch date. I just want --
<s> No, I can't.
<s> Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
<s> Just what I said. That's what I --
<s> I know, Walter, but I --
<s> Listen, Walter --
<s> I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
<s> You -- you --
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
<s> Bermuda... Rich, eh?
<s> He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
<s> Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
<s> I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
<s> Say, could I meet him?
<s> Now you got me.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.
<s> How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
<s> I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
<s> Thank you.
<s> His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
<s> You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
<s> That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
<s> Hold on a minute.
<s> I know, but --
<s> I get it!
<s> Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
<s> You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
<s> Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
<s> Okay, Walter. 
<s> What tickets?
<s> You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
<s> Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
<s> What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
<s> I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
<s> Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
<s> When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
<s> Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
<s> Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
<s> Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
<s> Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
<s> Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
<s> On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
<s> It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
<s> Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
<s> Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
<s> Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
<s> I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
<s> I'm busy, Duffy.
<s> They can't do that to me!
<s> Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
<s> Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
<s> Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
<s> Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
<s> Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
<s> Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
<s> What's the use? I can't win a pot.
<s> I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
<s> Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
<s> So long, Hildy.
<s> Just coffee.  And you, sir?
<s> I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
<s> Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
<s> You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
<s> Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
<s> I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
<s> What?
<s> Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
<s> We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
<s> Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
<s> But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
<s> An attempt to ruin us!
<s> We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
<s> I did.  Hold the wire.
<s> I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
<s> Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
<s> It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
<s> Five hundred dollars.
<s> Phone for you, Hildy.
<s> Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
<s> What's the matter? Getting yellow?
<s> Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
<s> I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
<s> All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
<s> What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
<s> Mother!
<s> Don't move!
<s> Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
<s> Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
<s> All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
<s> Hello, Mollie.
<s> -- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
<s> His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
<s> She and Mollie were talking.
<s> You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
<s> Apparently so.
<s> Yes, you was. Make him talk.
<s> I only know one.
<s> Bugger off.
<s> Sod.
<s> Ask her yourself.
<s> We thought it was poison.
<s> You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
<s> It's like telling fibs.
<s> We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
<s> I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
<s> Kiss me Hardy.
<s> I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
<s> You need trees for an avenue.
<s> Bugger the Buffs.
<s> And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
<s> That's it.
<s> This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
<s> Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
<s> Out.
<s> There, there, my baby.
<s> Grace!
<s> We did the decent thing.
<s> We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
<s> Father, that's enough now
<s> Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
<s> Happy as can be. In the old groove.
<s> Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
<s> What about R.J.?
<s> No, I told you...
<s> Who's your Daddy!
<s> No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
<s> Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
<s> Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
<s> Whoopie fucking doo.
<s> Fucking great.
<s> Great story Goober, how much?
<s> Holy crap, thanks!
<s> A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
<s> How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
<s> Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
<s> Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
<s> Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
<s> Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
<s> Cat fight, cat fight.
<s> Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
<s> And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
<s> Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
<s> Turn that fucking radio off!
<s> Yeah, showtime for what?
<s> We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
<s> There's not enough room.
<s> Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
<s> Quiet.
<s> What I need are some answers. 
<s> Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
<s> Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
<s> Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
<s> He should be back in a couple hours.
<s> Oh.
<s> That seems likely.
<s> Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
<s> Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
<s> These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
<s> Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
<s> Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
<s> That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
<s> Help, help us.
<s> No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
<s> Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
<s> No please, let me sit this one out.
<s> You got to be fucking joking.
<s> I don't know... about half an hour.
<s> Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
<s> A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
<s> Keys.
<s> His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
<s> What do they call you, sweety?
<s> Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
<s> Firefly.
<s> Huh?
<s> You said it, not me.
<s> Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
<s> Don't worry, I'm gone.
<s> Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
<s> Let's go see.
<s> My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
<s> What! God damn, how many?
<s> Over here, inside the smokehouse.
<s> Right.
<s> Dr. Satan?
<s> I always favored the Hulk.
<s> Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
<s> We found one.
<s> Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
<s> Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
<s> Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
<s> Woof.
<s> Oui.
<s> Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
<s> When you were a little French girl?
<s> Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
<s> Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
<s> It's true. I wouldn't lie.
<s> Shit.  Hi, honey.
<s> Hmmmph.
<s> Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
<s> Not in front of the boy.
<s> Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
<s> You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
<s> That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
<s> Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
<s> Please let me go with you.
<s> It's okay, Puff.
<s> What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
<s> I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
<s> I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Won't he be able to tell?
<s> I have a friend you might like to meet.
<s> Three foot one.
<s> With pleasure.
<s> Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
<s> I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
<s> We are animals after all.
<s> Yes, and...
<s> Nathan!
<s> I'll be out in a minute.
<s> Terrific. Can't wait!
<s> Yes, darling.
<s> Fifteen.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
<s> Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
<s> I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
<s> Nothing. Be right out.
<s> Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
<s> Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
<s> Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
<s> Of course not.
<s> Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
<s> Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
<s> ...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
<s> Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
<s> I had sold my fucking soul.
<s> That was wonderful!
<s> Oh boy!
<s> Shit.
<s> Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
<s> Ooka.
<s> And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
<s> Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
<s> Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
<s> Ounpoo. Ungh.
<s> Yes... Derek.
<s> Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
<s> I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
<s> Yep.
<s> Check!
<s> Right.
<s> We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
<s> No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
<s> Cash.
<s> What did he say?
<s> I lost twenty bucks.
<s> Yeah. Sure, sure.
<s> Why?
<s> You think I can lose?
<s> Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
<s> Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
<s> Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
<s> Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
<s> No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
<s> I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
<s> Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
<s> C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
<s> You hustlin' me?
<s> Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
<s> All right. Five hundred.
<s> Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
<s> I said we're leavin'.
<s> I'm a businessman, kid.
<s> You well-heeled, partner?
<s> Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
<s> Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
<s> What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
<s> Go on home. Just leave me the money.
<s> Talk to me, Charlie.
<s> Is that what you think?
<s> Now and then. Why, do you?
<s> You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
<s> A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
<s> Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
<s> How come you didn't catch your bus?
<s> Then why go to the bus station?
<s> No, not always.
<s> I used to be an actress.
<s> I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
<s> I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
<s> Give me a drag.
<s> At school. It's Thursday.
<s> Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
<s> Museums... art galleries... concerts.
<s> When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
<s> Eggs. How do you like them?
<s> It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
<s> I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
<s> You wanna drink?
<s> Would he know?
<s> Why did he tell you?
<s> I love you.
<s> Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
<s> Yes, I'm glad.
<s> Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
<s> What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
<s> Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
<s> You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
<s> You watch me.
<s> Thousand dollars a game.
<s> Let's go.
<s> It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
<s> You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
<s> We don't know that --
<s> Have you looked inside?
<s> Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
<s> Yes.
<s> I want to talk.  I just learned again.
<s> Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
<s> Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
<s> They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
<s> Please.
<s> That's fine.
<s> You got that right.
<s> Round back.
<s> It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
<s> Because the sky is so clear out here.
<s> This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
<s> That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
<s> Okay.
<s> What, Jim, what?
<s> I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
<s> I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
<s> I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
<s> She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
<s> 'Cause he wouldn't lie.
<s> Behind my house, up on the ridge.
<s> All their lines were busy.
<s> Hide the car.
<s> They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
<s> No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
<s> What? -- I... 
<s> I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
<s> It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
<s> I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
<s> We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
<s> Did it work?
<s> My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
<s> Think nothing of it, Spanky.
<s> Then get them out of there.
<s> It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
<s> Three years.
<s> College nickname.
<s> We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
<s> It's not me. They're overriding the system.
<s> I had a feeling you would.
<s> But Mr. President...
<s> And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
<s> Yes, Sir.
<s> But what, General?
<s> This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
<s> How long would their shields be down?
<s> Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
<s> He's doing a good job.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> You know me...
<s> Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
<s> Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
<s> I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
<s> But, Mr. President...
<s> Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
<s> And I am his.
<s> The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
<s> You've got it!
<s> What is it?
<s> I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
<s> No, Henry. Try not to talk.
<s> Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
<s> That was our assessment as well.
<s> My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
<s> The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
<s> That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
<s> As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
<s> Yes?
<s> But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
<s> Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
<s> He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
<s> It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
<s> Where is it? I want it.
<s> My father didn't want it incinerated.
<s> All I have to do is scream.
<s> I can reach it. I can reach it...
<s> Then wait -- count to twenty.
<s> And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
<s> Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
<s> Right.
<s> Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
<s> Don't worry. He won't.
<s> Umh?
<s> What???
<s> What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
<s> What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
<s> Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
<s> Junior...
<s> Penitent. Penitent...
<s> What did you find, Dad?
<s> That was seven hundred years ago.
<s> What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
<s> Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
<s> They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
<s> No.
<s> My name is Kazim.
<s> Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
<s> I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
<s> A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
<s> Okay, Shorty.
<s> That's it. Pankot Palace.
<s> Just a statue.
<s> Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
<s> Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
<s> Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
<s> Who cares? Where's that diamond!
<s> Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
<s> The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
<s> Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> He told me they knew I was coming here.
<s> It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
<s> Their children?
<s> It's pulling me deeper!
<s> Just one arm!
<s> PET IT??!!
<s> Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
<s> Oh really?
<s> What does the writing say?
<s> You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
<s> Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
<s> I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
<s> You're talking to an authority in that area.
<s> Don't catch cold.
<s> Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
<s> You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
<s> Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
<s> No... the heart's still beating!
<s> I'm not leaving without those stones.
<s> You've got to go to sleep now.
<s> Go!
<s> You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
<s> They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
<s> Al ???!!!
<s> Yes.
<s> What is your name?
<s> Where are we now?
<s> I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
<s> It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
<s> That a new Datsun?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Loading a gun.
<s> Who was that? Somebody out there?
<s> Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
<s> Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
<s> Can't see a Goddamn thi..
<s> Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
<s> Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
<s> Go out, take your first left.
<s> With Authority!
<s> Take a left and your next right.
<s> I'm at the airport.
<s> Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
<s> Send a man there. A secret agent.
<s> We get on a plane.
<s> What about it?
<s> Use my credit cards.
<s> It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
<s> Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
<s> What is it?
<s> Little late for that.
<s> Why not?
<s> She's beautiful...! What do I do?
<s> .
<s> Wait.
<s> Where are you staying?
<s> To the hotel. To register.
<s> What are you looking at?
<s> Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
<s> You have no taste.
<s> That place. By the window.
<s> The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
<s> ...I've lost something. I must get it back.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
<s> Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
<s> Oh come on.
<s> It's not your time. I get time off.
<s> We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
<s> Follow her.
<s> That's not funny.
<s> You think. That's what you're good at.
<s> You have to! Quickly!
<s> Well...?
<s> He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
<s> I can't handle that thing.
<s> Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
<s> GO-TOE. It's some islands.
<s> Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
<s> Oh, I can't.
<s> What a nerve!
<s> I dyed it. We're all getting old.
<s> We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
<s> He work for us?
<s> Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
<s> It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
<s> I have a new client.
<s> You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
<s> And how do you service foreigners.
<s> What about it?
<s> Oh....Sure.
<s> No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
<s> I noticed you staring.
<s> Just give me the keys.
<s> We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I said...I didn't say..anything!
<s> I didn't say anything.
<s> Blake?
<s> ...Rene.
<s> Me still. They left you alone?
<s> It's not apparent.
<s> You talk to yourself.
<s> Why do you do it?
<s> You're talking to me.
<s> Why'd you run off?
<s> Sometimes. I told you I did.
<s> I'm sorry. What will you do?
<s> I'm just on vacation.
<s> What'd he steal?
<s> We figure out if it's in here.
<s> Where would you go to sell a chip?
<s> You've  been there?
<s> Can you?
<s> You can say that again. What do we do?
<s> It was my choice.
<s> What?
<s> I'll come back for you.
<s> You're gonna laugh.
<s> Do something!
<s> He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
<s> I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
<s> A drink...
<s> Why not?
<s> Ahhh...Okay?!!!
<s> Perfectly.
<s> For reading.
<s> I heard them.
<s> Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
<s> Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
<s> Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
<s> C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
<s> No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
<s> I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
<s> What caliber is your gun?
<s> Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
<s> Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
<s> We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
<s> What about you, you got a crew already?
<s> I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
<s> You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
<s> Catch you later.
<s> Try the car.
<s> I didn't want to leave it there...
<s> No, thank you.
<s> I'm doing an interview.
<s> Who's calling?
<s> ...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
<s> So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
<s> I'll call you then.
<s> That's right...
<s> Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
<s> Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
<s> You eating with us?
<s> Hardly new news.
<s> Who are these people?
<s> Good.
<s> What?
<s> I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
<s> Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
<s> What I've seen... I've liked.
<s> Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
<s> Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
<s> Like what?
<s> The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
<s> Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
<s> You okay?
<s> Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
<s> Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
<s> Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
<s> My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
<s> ...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
<s> I heard.
<s> No.
<s> What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
<s> I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
<s> I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
<s> No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
<s> What?
<s> Right.
<s> "The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
<s> "There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
<s> It acts as a...
<s> I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
<s> Chapter and verse.
<s> ...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
<s> You did good, Massey!
<s> And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
<s> We'd better go before we get thrown out.
<s> Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
<s> What part?
<s> We rest, Your Honor.
<s> Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
<s> You want Botox?
<s> Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
<s> We did not.
<s> Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
<s> That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
<s> Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
<s> He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
<s> Ruth Rabino.
<s> I said yes.
<s> Isn't everything?
<s> Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
<s> Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
<s> But why him?
<s> Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
<s> You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
<s> You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
<s> I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
<s> No. Don't stop.
<s> Your mother was.
<s> I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
<s> What is it Miles?
<s> Huh?
<s> Did you just propose to me?
<s> Do you want to sleep on it?
<s> Oh Miles!
<s> No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
<s> May I come in?
<s> On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
<s> The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
<s> What kind of "stuff?"
<s> You can't prove anything.
<s> Meaning my house.
<s> Please! Leave the house.
<s> Now. But first, he worked for you.
<s> Hello Miles.
<s> Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
<s> But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
<s> My whole metabolism is -- off.
<s> We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
<s> Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
<s> You used his credit card.
<s> Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
<s> Of Massey Myerson?
<s> I'm dying.
<s> I guess.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Heh heh.
<s> Oh brother. Here we go.
<s> Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
<s> Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> No. You're not.
<s> HA!
<s> Mother?
<s> Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
<s> Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
<s> Yes, sir?
<s> If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
<s> You're a peculiar chap.
<s> A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
<s> I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
<s> That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
<s> I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
<s> I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
<s> Nothing. 
<s> He doesn't think so much of you either.
<s> I suppose so.
<s> Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back. 
<s> Yessir. She refuses them all.
<s> You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
<s> Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
<s> Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
<s> Thanks.
<s> You win!
<s> Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
<s> I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
<s> Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
<s> Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
<s> Outside!
<s> Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
<s> I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
<s> Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Well, you were!
<s> You weren't so bad yourself.
<s> You didn't give that boy all your money?
<s> I'm following you.
<s> We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
<s> I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
<s> What?
<s> Hitch-hiking.
<s> Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
<s> No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
<s> You're an expert, I suppose.
<s> You figured that all out yourself, huh?
<s> Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
<s> Mind your own business.
<s> A black eye. 
<s> Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
<s> Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
<s> I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter—
<s> I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
<s> Not interested. 
<s> Thank you.
<s> You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
<s> Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
<s> Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
<s> Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
<s> Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay, pete. 
<s> ain't got a hat—
<s> I ain't got a hat.
<s> Said he was gonna stay a week.
<s> Yeah—wouldn't it?
<s> You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
<s> I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
<s> You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
<s> Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
<s> Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
<s> Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
<s> There were no phone records.
<s> I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
<s> Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
<s> You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
<s> Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
<s> What's the other name?
<s> At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
<s> Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
<s> It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
<s> Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
<s> There's a word - orders.
<s> I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
<s> He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
<s> Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
<s> If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
<s> No, I did not.
<s> Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
<s> Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
<s> Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
<s> Did you bag any geese on this trip?
<s> Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
<s> Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
<s> Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
<s> Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
<s> Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
<s> I had the cause of death.
<s> But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
<s> What?
<s> Hi, Freckle Face.
<s> How many shots you say you heard?
<s> That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
<s> Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
<s> Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
<s> David Ferrie.
<s> No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
<s> Nonsense.  What next?
<s> Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
<s> No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
<s> Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
<s> That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
<s> Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
<s> But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
<s> Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
<s> It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
<s> How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
<s> Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
<s> I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
<s> You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
<s> I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
<s> Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
<s> I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
<s> And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
<s> Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
<s> Allen Dulles?
<s> They're gonna love you, chief.
<s> Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
<s> Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
<s> No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
<s> Ever ask him?
<s> Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
<s> More than ten years.
<s> I don't know if I should talk about this.
<s> I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
<s> Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
<s> Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
<s> Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
<s> We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
<s> Germany.
<s> I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
<s> If you must know, virtually nothing.
<s> That's it.
<s> How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
<s> Six.
<s> No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
<s> Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
<s> I understand.
<s> Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
<s> I need a favor.
<s> A bit.
<s> Let me finish. Can I finish?
<s> You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
<s> I can't believe you do me this way.
<s> If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
<s> While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
<s> 'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
<s> What's her name?
<s> Okay.
<s> We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
<s> I didn't?
<s> It was the other guy who busted me.
<s> If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
<s> Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
<s> Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
<s> You went out this morning and bought a gun?
<s> The Delfonics.
<s> How'd you find that out?
<s> I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
<s> You're not old. You look great.
<s> Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
<s> I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
<s> Oh, are you? Does she know that?
<s> I go back to work tomorrow.
<s> They seem to like the idea.
<s> I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
<s> Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
<s> Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
<s> You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
<s> Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
<s> Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
<s> That's my job.
<s> More or less.
<s> You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
<s> He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
<s> Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
<s> We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
<s> They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
<s> Yeah?
<s> It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
<s> I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
<s> Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
<s> After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
<s> She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
<s> It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
<s> Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
<s> Beaumont Livingston?
<s> Hi, Melanie.
<s> Sure.
<s> They asked.
<s> I didn't tell 'em anything.
<s> One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
<s> I told them.
<s> It's true, isn't it?
<s> And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
<s> Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
<s> What'd you care?
<s> Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
<s> She don't know shit about the money.
<s> Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
<s> Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Detroit.
<s> You lived in Japan, when?
<s> Who's arm is that?
<s> Must of made quite an impression.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> Does that bother you?
<s> This one.
<s> Who's your partner?
<s> That's good money.
<s> Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
<s> Which one is for the car?
<s> Okay.
<s> The moon -- I dunno
<s> I'm in my underwear.
<s> That was Beaumont.
<s> He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
<s> But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
<s> She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
<s> Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
<s> Pretty sure.
<s> Fuck you for asking me that.
<s> If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
<s> Maybe the Feds got it.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
<s> Where would you like me to put my ash?
<s> Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
<s> Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
<s> Livingston, huh?
<s> Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
<s> House.
<s> I got some more business for ya.
<s> Hear what?
<s> Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
<s> Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
<s> Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
<s> Git your ass in here.
<s> That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> He leave town?
<s> Della?
<s> I see.
<s> No, don't. But thanks.
<s> Yeah, ever since that ...
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> It's short, huh?
<s> Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
<s> They're not interested, Jake.
<s> Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
<s> I'm hanging up.
<s> Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
<s> Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
<s> What the hell is that supposed to mean?
<s> I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
<s> ... I've seen them, too.
<s> I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
<s> Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
<s> I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
<s> What? By myself?
<s> I'm walking, aren't I?
<s> The postal service. I'm a mailman.
<s> Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
<s> I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
<s> Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
<s> Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
<s> Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
<s> It's freezing.
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> Go to sleep.
<s> Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
<s> I don't know.
<s> A good lay.
<s> Lemme see.
<s> Gabe.
<s> Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> They weren't human!
<s> Where are we?
<s> Where?
<s> You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
<s> Lie down!
<s> You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
<s> Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
<s> Let go!
<s> I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
<s> Sit down.
<s> It's over, Jake. It's all over.
<s> Who are you? What are you doing to me?
<s> What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
<s> I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
<s> I'm tired.
<s> Mid-town mostly.
<s> West.
<s> Don't be funny.
<s> Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
<s> Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
<s> Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<s> What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
<s> I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
<s> If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
<s> So why tell me now?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
<s> Push 'em back.
<s> You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
<s> What?!
<s> Total delirium.
<s> Jacob Singer?
<s> Count 'em on one hand.
<s> No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
<s> That black car?
<s> I don't know what to do.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
<s> They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
<s> Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
<s> No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
<s> He doesn't like it.
<s> You got lucky.
<s> Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
<s> THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
<s> What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
<s> Delongpre! Out of time!
<s> Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
<s> Rizzo did.
<s> Cool.
<s> And you said high school was boring.
<s> The hull's imploding!
<s> They're back here.
<s> Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
<s> Two more charges to go.
<s> You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
<s> I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
<s> At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
<s> You just keep an eye out.
<s> Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
<s> Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
<s> Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
<s> No you don't!
<s> Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
<s> 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
<s> What if we don't?
<s> Were you close to your father?
<s> She needs a little time.
<s> No shit. I got no problem with that.
<s> Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
<s> We're screwed.
<s> Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
<s> Just come on, I've got an idea.
<s> Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
<s> Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
<s> Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
<s> Would you?
<s> Later.
<s> Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
<s> Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
<s> Am I in there?
<s> Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
<s> Who are you apologizing to?
<s> I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
<s> We're missing two of the kids!
<s> I just know.
<s> Keep trying!
<s> Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
<s> But...I...400 years?
<s> Exactly.
<s> Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
<s> Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
<s> My boat's neat, dad!
<s> Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
<s> What?
<s> I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
<s> You got it.
<s> Two cases. And dinner when you land.
<s> ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
<s> Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
<s> What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
<s> Where...?
<s> Have you ever had one do this?
<s> Dead astern! Zig-zag!
<s> Do you see the kids?
<s> Older, sillier.
<s> Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
<s> Where is he?
<s> No. Home here.
<s> Do I need any more authority?
<s> I didn't agree to that!
<s> Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
<s> Maybe we can save August...
<s> Who are you?
<s> No, it was local jurisdiction.
<s> You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
<s> About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
<s> It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
<s> What stinks so bad?
<s> Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
<s> Florida license plate.
<s> They must've hit something.
<s> A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
<s> You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
<s> It's a whale out there.
<s> Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
<s> Just keep kicking.
<s> Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
<s> Some friends and me took a house.
<s> A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
<s> I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
<s> What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
<s> It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
<s> You're leaving?
<s> He's busy.
<s> We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
<s> Transplants?
<s> Let me see your hands...
<s> Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
<s> The shaft is giving.
<s> No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
<s> He's under!
<s> Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
<s> Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
<s> I don't have it.
<s> Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
<s> Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
<s> I totally heard you did.
<s> Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
<s> What?
<s> Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
<s> Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
<s> Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
<s> You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
<s> No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
<s> Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
<s> That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
<s> You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
<s> Yup.
<s> Yup.
<s> Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
<s> Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
<s> First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
<s> I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
<s> They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
<s> Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
<s> Sorry. I was just getting something.
<s> Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
<s> I wrote that.
<s> You're kidding!
<s> Yeah?
<s> God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
<s> You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
<s> I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
<s> I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
<s> Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
<s> You're gonna like this, I promise.
<s> Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
<s> No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
<s> Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
<s> Well, you're lucky it's not you.
<s> So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
<s> I went to the doctor today.
<s> What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
<s> Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
<s> Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
<s> Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
<s> Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
<s> No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
<s> Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
<s> Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
<s> I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
<s> Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
<s> Think you can narrow it down for me.
<s> Tore up from the floor up?
<s> Either I just pissed my pants or...
<s> Thundercats are go!
<s> I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
<s> That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
<s> I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
<s> Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
<s> Yeah, but it sucks for free.
<s> No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
<s> I'm pregnant.
<s> Or stage parents!
<s> Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
<s> Well, you are kind of... convex.
<s> A Pilates machine?
<s> Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
<s> Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
<s> I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
<s> Yeah, downtown.
<s> It's a loft.
<s> ...I said, I like your hair.
<s> Not really.
<s> ...Yeah, sure.
<s> How'd you meet Early?
<s> Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
<s> Early, sing me a song.
<s> Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
<s> Early! Stop!!
<s> Not so good. You sure you have to?
<s> What do you need a Bible for?
<s> No sir.
<s> Best kind.
<s> Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
<s> I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
<s> Forget about it, doesn't matter.
<s> Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
<s> What happened to Adele?
<s> This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
<s> Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
<s> You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
<s> Fuck!
<s> Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
<s> What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
<s> I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> What is it?
<s> Where would we find him?
<s> 17.
<s> Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
<s> Yes!
<s> Was up bitch?
<s> Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
<s> Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What do you want?
<s> You think?
<s> A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
<s> I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
<s> I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
<s> Yep.
<s> The cartoon?
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah. She's only 13.
<s> She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
<s> Bet.
<s> Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> So. You never know when you can end up like that.
<s> I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
<s> Right here.
<s> Na.
<s> Yeah. Do it again.
<s> Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
<s> She won't? Why not?
<s> But I'm scared Telly.
<s> I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
<s> I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
<s> Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
<s> No, I didn't bleed.
<s> Hell yeah, they don't know.
<s> Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
<s> It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
<s> Yep.
<s> Yeah.
<s> But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
<s> Hi Telly. Where you been?
<s> But then I won't need your money.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What kind of problem?
<s> Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
<s> Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
<s> Let's see how much he wants to play.
<s> You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
<s> Maybe you should.
<s> Then what's he talking about?
<s> I was at the beach.
<s> But a hundred men could move him.
<s> He was with me?
<s> Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
<s> Just a second.  Hello?
<s> I know what I said!  She looks just like...
<s> You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
<s> Then call them!
<s> So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
<s> If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
<s> I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
<s> Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
<s> Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
<s> The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
<s> --the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
<s> Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
<s> He already did once.
<s> Why did he what?
<s> He was watching you.
<s> Nice meeting you.
<s> I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Who's Kathy?
<s> No prints.
<s> Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
<s> I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
<s> Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
<s> Anything else?
<s> I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
<s> Meaning?
<s> Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
<s> Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
<s> We're going to work on the message.
<s> You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
<s> To my room and then I went for a walk.
<s> Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
<s> I want to be the best I can.
<s> Whatever's on your mind.
<s> Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
<s> What are they, please?
<s> No.  I don't.
<s> I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
<s> Are we talking about me, or chess?
<s> Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
<s> That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
<s> Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
<s> Then show me who you are.
<s> No.
<s> The line was busy.  I'll try again.
<s> Because she killed herself!!
<s> It could be anything.
<s> I got lucky.
<s> You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
<s> I don't have to go through with it either.
<s> Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
<s> That's worse.
<s> I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
<s> You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
<s> I have no extraordinary powers.
<s> You won't have to.
<s> Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
<s> Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
<s> Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
<s> There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
<s> You will tell me her name and we will go together.
<s> Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
<s> We must enter the swamp.
<s> What will happen?
<s> Yes. It is today.
<s> You will not, then?
<s> I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
<s> He saved our lives.
<s> How did you know I had sons?
<s> Not sleepy, either?
<s> These we'll pay for.
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> At the gallop!
<s> I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
<s> The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
<s> I cannot go with you, my friend.
<s> You can have half.
<s> I don't think it's working.
<s> Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
<s> Then look!
<s> A match for your son, I think.
<s> Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
<s> Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
<s> That is true.
<s> The most beautiful woman in the world.
<s> No, she was not as beautiful.
<s> You said nothing. You told me nothing.
<s> Where is he? My son.
<s> Yes.
<s> OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
<s> No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
<s> No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
<s> ...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
<s> Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
<s> Well, I don't need them...
<s> Huh... 500 meters?
<s> How can you say it?
<s> OK.
<s> OK.
<s> No.
<s> ...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
<s> OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
<s> Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
<s> ...17.
<s> What shall we do?
<s> That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
<s> Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
<s> Nothing, for the moment.
<s> Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
<s> ...I got lost, Mister.
<s> I have no fear.
<s> I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
<s> Huh? That's smart!
<s> Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
<s> Huh?
<s> Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
<s> You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
<s> Salute.
<s> I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
<s> ...Even his mother wouldn't.
<s> High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
<s> I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
<s> You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
<s> Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
<s> No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
<s> You need a ride, Preacher?
<s> You have?
<s> The flowers... they're beautiful.
<s> There was no card.
<s> It's just a regular day.
<s> Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
<s> Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
<s> You've just decided, is that right?
<s> Go to sleep Ellen.
<s> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
<s> Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
<s> I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
<s> If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
<s> You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
<s> You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
<s> Nine.
<s> Making the grand total?
<s> Umm, no.  It's just that --
<s> She knew you loved her.
<s> I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
<s> Why know?
<s> So I've been informed.
<s> You were right.  From the heart is always better.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> It's mine to risk.
<s> I need your help.
<s> Someone should be with you.
<s> No alcohol?
<s> No.
<s> Water?
<s> We can go to one if you'd prefer.
<s> Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
<s> Of course.
<s> Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
<s> You OK out there?
<s> Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
<s> Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
<s> Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
<s> So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
<s> That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
<s> When?
<s> That's impressive. How did you do that?
<s> We?
<s> OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
<s> Yes... I'll give you that.
<s> I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
<s> Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
<s> How much, do you think?
<s> A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
<s> Yes, of course. How much do you need?
<s> It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
<s> Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
<s> What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
<s> It's me, Yuri.
<s> No.
<s> I can't tell you.
<s> I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
<s> He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
<s> He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
<s> That's not what's important.
<s> I believe you! Don't worry.
<s> Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
<s> Did she have a weapon in her hand?
<s> I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
<s> No, she'd stashed it by then.
<s> I guess.
<s> I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
<s> Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
<s> I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
<s> Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
<s> No, she was crying her eyes out.
<s> Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
<s> -- uh --
<s> Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
<s> Spill.
<s> No!
<s> Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
<s> What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
<s> I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
<s> I know. He has it sent out.
<s> Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
<s> I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
<s> So?
<s> Your scrunchie?
<s> Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
<s> What?!
<s> I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
<s> I wasn't gonna --
<s> She's completely untrustworthy.
<s> For a butt-head? Yes.
<s> Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
<s> Is he the only one?
<s> What, like on va-kay?
<s> You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
<s> You should. Do you have a resume?
<s> Maybe she found him like that.
<s> Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
<s> Your what?
<s> So are you!
<s> But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
<s> No.
<s> Uh -- sure.
<s> But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
<s> Are you serious?
<s> Chuck.
<s> Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
<s> Faith.
<s> Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
<s> Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
<s> Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
<s> Grotesque... monstrous...
<s> Not from me, surely...
<s> To be my bride, of course.
<s> We're both of us damned, my beauty.
<s> I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
<s> It's terrible.
<s> Who might these friends be?
<s> Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
<s> You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
<s> If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
<s> How is it this hag knows the truth?
<s> Will you lead me to her?
<s> Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
<s> Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
<s> Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
<s> Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
<s> Careful, lad.
<s> A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
<s> Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
<s> Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
<s> What know you of fields of war?
<s> Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
<s> Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
<s> Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
<s> No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
<s> Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
<s> Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
<s> Nay.  This time we strike first!
<s> On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
<s> Been telling you that all along, lad.
<s> Best get down close to the moat, lad.
<s> It's what we'll find there worries me.
<s> ... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
<s> The wound is mortal.
<s> Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
<s> Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
<s> Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
<s> Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
<s> And did you?
<s> Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
<s> Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
<s> Sorry.
<s> If you like.
<s> Unicorn?
<s> All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
<s> That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> I'm not its master.
<s> Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
<s> To fetch your napkin.
<s> It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
<s> Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
<s> Oh, la...
<s> Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
<s> Then, perchance you'll me.
<s> Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
<s> I was bewitched... it's better this way...
<s> Sunlight... It destroys him.
<s> And I... love you...
<s> Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
<s> But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
<s> Lili... I love you!
<s> Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
<s> His feet shall never cross my lips.
<s> Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
<s> Ask away, sweet man.
<s> Dead, dead, dead.
<s> What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
<s> Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
<s> And am I not fair?
<s> And sweet?
<s> I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
<s> Small miracles better than no miracles...
<s> Up ahead!
<s> It's done... we'll never catch him.
<s> The Black Baron, you say?
<s> To Castle Couer de Noir?
<s> Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
<s> I wanna be with you today.
<s> Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
<s> Mom said I should.
<s> And why was the alarm on?
<s> I couldn't sleep last night.
<s> I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
<s> I want you to try something with me, okay?
<s> His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
<s> I don't want you to!
<s> I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
<s> I'm not gay.
<s> You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
<s> If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
<s> He's got a standing invitation.
<s> George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
<s> He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
<s> I flushed it down the toilet.
<s> If that's what it takes.
<s> After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
<s> how much weight have you lost?
<s> He buys and sells the world.
<s> I'm not.
<s> That's too long.
<s> I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
<s> From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
<s> For everything.
<s> What can I do for you, George?
<s> Not a shower.
<s> You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
<s> I'll ask.
<s> You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
<s> You'll know me by the time we're through.
<s> I'll get your bag.
<s> I almost saw Catalina.
<s> No.
<s> You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
<s> I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> You'll have money when you work for it.
<s> We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
<s> Hi, Mom.
<s> What do you know about me?
<s> Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
<s> Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
<s> Are you taking them still?
<s> I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
<s> Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
<s> I can die trying.
<s> I haven't been touched in years.
<s> I know there's an explanation.
<s> I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
<s> I want you to find someone for me.
<s> Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
<s> You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
<s> But you can't call me while you think?
<s> You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
<s> How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
<s> Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
<s> Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
<s> I want him with me.
<s> He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
<s> Well, for later then.
<s> Sam's favorite.
<s> I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
<s> My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
<s> The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
<s> You're not well.
<s> I'd rather you not be here.
<s> I can hire workers to help me.
<s> What did I say?
<s> So could I.
<s> Not a perfect day.
<s> No.
<s> Don't even...I'm there.
<s> We should take a vacation.
<s> Sooner than the Fall.
<s> Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
<s> You can't go because of Sam?
<s> I never asked for more.
<s> It's not ours.  It's George's.
<s> No.
<s> Okay.
<s> Can you stay for dinner?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Dad's home, already?
<s> Nigger.
<s> It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
<s> Cost you a pair of nylons.
<s> We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
<s> Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
<s> She got married last month.
<s> I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
<s> That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
<s> You went to Monroe?
<s> I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
<s> So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
<s> You need collateral.
<s> Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
<s> There is no Boom-Boom Room.
<s> Oooh...
<s> Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
<s> Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
<s> Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
<s> What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
<s> That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
<s> He even got my daddy's watch.
<s> We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
<s> Winston. His name's Winston.
<s> Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
<s> Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
<s> What do you want, Claude?
<s> Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
<s> You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
<s> Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
<s> He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
<s> Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
<s> Let me see that.
<s> Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
<s> We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
<s> Hey, there's Wilkins!
<s> He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
<s> An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
<s> Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
<s> Why the hell not?
<s> Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
<s> I'm sorry, he's on medication...
<s> Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
<s> New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
<s> You heard what the man said! Move it!
<s> My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
<s> Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
<s> No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
<s> What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
<s> I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
<s> Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
<s> I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
<s> Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
<s> I prefer bourbon.
<s> I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
<s> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
<s> Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
<s> Satchmo.
<s> Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
<s> You found him.
<s> Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
<s> He's sick?
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
<s> ...their damned souls will be ours.
<s> Noon...
<s> Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
<s> You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
<s> Show him Central Park.
<s> Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
<s> Put it in your mouth.
<s> Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
<s> Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
<s> But those are my roommate's sodas...
<s> C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
<s> Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
<s> Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Metallica, Dad. Come on.
<s> Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
<s> What was it called, sir.
<s> Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
<s> Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
<s> That way.
<s> Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
<s> Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
<s> You followed him?
<s> Dude, it's us. Let us in.
<s> Andrew.
<s> Why are you laughing?
<s> If you want to.
<s> It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
<s> I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
<s> School?
<s> What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
<s> Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
<s> ...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
<s> East Rutherford.
<s> I love you.
<s> Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
<s> You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
<s> You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
<s> Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
<s> Nude. Imagine, a pair.
<s> Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
<s> Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
<s> Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
<s> I don't care... Just get it over with.
<s> Even the alarm didn't wake him.
<s> Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
<s> Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
<s> Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
<s> Only a few? You're just not trying.
<s> Did you ever see anybody renew?
<s> ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
<s> No.  Just no.
<s> No.
<s> Not about that.
<s> I suppose. But what if you want to live?
<s> Six. I go red next year.
<s> But I wasn't sure you'd come.
<s> All right.
<s> Both... running's what I'm interested in.
<s> We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
<s> Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
<s> Some people say children need human mothering.
<s> All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
<s> He's good, isn't he?
<s> I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
<s> I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
<s> I doubt it.
<s> No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
<s> To what?
<s> You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
<s> Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
<s> It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
<s> We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
<s> Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
<s> Never, never, ever. Nothing.
<s> More... many more.
<s> Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
<s> Oh my... I'll try.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, I thought my wife...
<s> I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
<s> Right... This just glided along.
<s> Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
<s> It's me...
<s> No, honey... It was part of the deal.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
<s> Okay...
<s> Yes.
<s> Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
<s> Sure.
<s> Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
<s> Do ya good.
<s> His physical condition.
<s> All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
<s> Out in back.
<s> He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
<s> Not even close.
<s> FUCKIN' "A".
<s> No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
<s> But my head...
<s> No, no I don't. Are you sure?
<s> What night?
<s> All right.
<s> Thanks, guys.
<s> I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
<s> No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
<s> Okay... Lemme clear it with...
<s> Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
<s> Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
<s> Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't remember... What happened that night?
<s> Whatiya mean?
<s> You really don't remember?
<s> No... I really don't want to talk about it.
<s> I do like you, Sheila.
<s> Thank you.
<s> It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
<s> Well, what do you know about that!
<s> Okay, brother.
<s> I see.
<s> Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
<s> Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
<s> Nothing. Why?
<s> Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
<s> When are you going to start?
<s> How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
<s> Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
<s> Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
<s> That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
<s> I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
<s> The only one.
<s> The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
<s> Shall we have another?
<s> Suppose she should leave it?
<s> Why, no.
<s> Splendid!
<s> I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
<s> Oh, dear.
<s> How can we get in touch with them?
<s> Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
<s> Mine?
<s> Do you think this will come in my time?
<s> Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
<s> You?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
<s> It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
<s> Nothing about the porters yet?
<s> Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
<s> All right. Sorry, George.
<s> Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
<s> George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
<s> Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
<s> She's going with me.
<s> Yes, everything!
<s> Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
<s> In for what?
<s> My name's Sondra.
<s> That was easy. I read your books.
<s> I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
<s> Bump?
<s> You see, it's not a dream.
<s> Struggling, why?
<s> I was just going to.
<s> Why, mother?
<s> I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
<s> Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
<s> You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
<s> Hesitated, sir.
<s> Cowan--
<s> Cowan--
<s> It's not even a fucking door.
<s> I guess I lost:
<s> Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
<s> Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
<s> I'd go with number three.
<s> It was a long time ago.-
<s> Something seem unusual to you about that?
<s> A what?
<s> And what's this ... ?
<s> Where to?
<s> No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
<s> I think that's what's happening...
<s> What if he's telling the truth?
<s> I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
<s> For how long?
<s> Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
<s> Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
<s> Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
<s> It's... coming.
<s> They're not my pals--
<s> I wanna make a deal.
<s> But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
<s> Wait-- listen--
<s> So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
<s> Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
<s> If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
<s> And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
<s> They're inside.
<s> Please --
<s> What is it?
<s> Anne Lively...
<s> I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
<s> Yes, you did.
<s> How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
<s> I can't even stand up --
<s> Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
<s> I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
<s> On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
<s> So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
<s> I understand.  Sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
<s> Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
<s> Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
<s> I show a cop on horseback.
<s> Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
<s> Did he close the front door?
<s> Did Marks close the front door?!
<s> Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
<s> Any ID on the shooter yet?
<s> Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
<s> Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
<s> We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
<s> I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
<s> To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
<s> I need help with her.
<s> Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
<s> I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
<s> Once I even told him I loved him.
<s> The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
<s> I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
<s> Good-bye, Dad...
<s> Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
<s> Some -- somebody's father?
<s> No.
<s> Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
<s> You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
<s> If... you have one.
<s> No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
<s> Lamar --
<s> Tell him not now.
<s> I'll be right there.
<s> None of your damn business.
<s> He's my subordinate!
<s> Wait, just a second...
<s> Not quite.
<s> Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
<s> How?
<s> Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
<s> Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
<s> There's thousands of units like this one.
<s> No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
<s> Two?
<s> They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
<s> How many?
<s> Knott!
<s> Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
<s> You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
<s> Sure.  Raincheck.
<s> You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
<s> So you haven't seen his apartment?
<s> You mean after he lost your son.
<s> He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
<s> To what?  Trap him?
<s> I haven't seen him in two years.
<s> Shhh!  They're sleeping.
<s> Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
<s> No thank you.
<s> Snifter are for warm drinks --
<s> Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
<s> Is it a good room?
<s> Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
<s> Where's the place to go tonight?
<s> Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
<s> We used to take baths together.
<s> She's, uh, sleeping.
<s> Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
<s> They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
<s> I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
<s> Shhh. He'll hear you.
<s> Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> Draw.
<s> Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
<s> We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
<s> Yeah?
<s> And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
<s> Ricky's taken care of.
<s> That's it.
<s> Why?
<s> They were out of line --
<s> That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
<s> Then what are you saying?
<s> Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
<s> Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
<s> Excuse me, we need to make a call.
<s> Thanks.
<s> So?
<s> Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
<s> Don't be shitty.
<s> What are we delivering?
<s> I'm not taking her to a bar.
<s> This paint sucks. The white shows through.
<s> Is that the woman from..?
<s> Pretty nice.
<s> How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
<s> But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
<s> We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> They asked who it was.
<s> What the fuck do you...
<s> Sold it, stole it, whatever...
<s> What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
<s> Like I said, I don't know.
<s> You got that right.
<s> Where?
<s> I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
<s> You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
<s> It was six in the fucking morning.
<s> What do you have left?
<s> They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
<s> Let's just go now and wait.
<s> I don't want to take any more chances.
<s> You're not getting a gun.
<s> Bobby and Ricky.
<s> Fuck...
<s> What do you mean 'kinda?'
<s> Well, come on then. It's back here.
<s> What?
<s> He's on the list.
<s> Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
<s> I'll tell him someone else told me.
<s> Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
<s> Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
<s> No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
<s> Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
<s> You think this shit's funny, Ho?
<s> Word.
<s> Soho Grand, right?
<s> You're from LA, right?
<s> You'll love it.
<s> Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
<s> We're square.
<s> We're going to New York?
<s> And where do we bring it?
<s> You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
<s> You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
<s> So tell me how it is.
<s> Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
<s> Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
<s> And where might that be?
<s> Bet you like that shit.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
<s> Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
<s> You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
<s> 'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
<s> Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
<s> I ain't said I'm ashamed.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> That's what Mama used to say.
<s> Read it and keep on reading.
<s> Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
<s> A black man playing big league ball is something.
<s> I sure met some.
<s> For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
<s> Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
<s> Next week, Brother Minister.
<s> And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
<s> What?
<s> Are you?
<s> Yes.
<s> What do you think?
<s> I'm not made of glass.
<s> We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
<s> Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
<s> Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
<s> I'm tired of praying.
<s> Let's get out of this cold.
<s> I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
<s> What did I tell you about assuming?
<s> Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
<s> You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
<s> You put it very well.
<s> Allah Akbar.
<s> If she got eyes, she do.
<s> Your control over your children, therefore --
<s> 500.
<s> What mission?
<s> No. You'll be marked for death.
<s> ...That isn't a whore?
<s> Me?
<s> Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
<s> Shorty, this is Laura.
<s> Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
<s> Eat lead, coppers.
<s> The hell you are.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
<s> I'm the man.
<s> You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
<s> Watch your tongue, boy.
<s> I don't know shit about you.
<s> So you are going to talk me to death.
<s> [I have a friend there.]
<s> It's a little late.
<s> So where do we begin?
<s> [Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
<s> [No!]
<s> [Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
<s> [Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
<s> [Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
<s> [You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
<s> [Lucky how?]
<s> Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
<s> I drink.
<s> My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
<s> What do you mean, I'm here?
<s> Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
<s> You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
<s> A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
<s> You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
<s> Yes or no?
<s> Different door. Not far from here.
<s> Who's Emilio?
<s> Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
<s> I'm not crying.
<s> Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
<s> They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
<s> It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
<s> No, that was in Columbia.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
<s> Your father has business.
<s> I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
<s> That's not a question.
<s> You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
<s> It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
<s> So are you.
<s> Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
<s> I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
<s> For a year?
<s> She understands men.
<s> [No. Why?]
<s> I'm trying, mom.
<s> We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
<s> You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
<s> I think it's fantastic.
<s> She's young. She'll get over it.
<s> [He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
<s> [We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
<s> [I should start going for your tits first.]
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
<s> What was she to Creasy then?
<s> She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
<s> You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
<s> What?
<s> Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
<s> Which one was that?
<s> I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
<s> I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
<s> We just talked.
<s> Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
<s> Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
<s> Who?
<s> Your son Marty?
<s> I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
<s> Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
<s> I'm having a very good time, too.
<s> Benjamin Franklin High School.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
<s> Oh, I'm fine.
<s> Maybe that would be a good idea.
<s> All right.
<s> How do you do?
<s> We just live one flight up.
<s> Okay.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
<s> No, I'm not kidding.
<s> I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
<s> Where you going now?
<s> I'll see you around.
<s> Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
<s> Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
<s> Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
<s> Marty...
<s> You gonna die without a son.
<s> Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
<s> Sure.
<s> Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
<s> Hey, Ang'...
<s> You want a beer, Ang'?
<s> Waddaya read there, Joe?
<s> Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
<s> That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
<s> No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
<s> Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
<s> You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
<s> The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
<s> Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
<s> So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
<s> I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
<s> Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
<s> Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
<s> She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
<s> I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
<s> Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
<s> Just one for a start.
<s> Home.
<s> That's right.
<s> Hospital.
<s> There's only one way.
<s> You really think we hurt him that bad?
<s> Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
<s> ...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
<s> And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
<s> Duke Forrest.
<s> Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
<s> The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
<s> Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
<s> He can't take much more time on the table.
<s> Except we forgot one other small thing.
<s> Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
<s> This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
<s> What's he got to write, for God's sake?
<s> Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
<s> Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
<s> Don't stop now! Please...
<s> Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
<s> A football game?
<s> Right.
<s> Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
<s> We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
<s> I like an olive.
<s> An eternal damnation.
<s> Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
<s> On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
<s> We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
<s> Not necessarily.
<s> For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
<s> It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
<s> Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
<s> You're leaving tomorrow?
<s> I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
<s> Why would he do that?
<s> I didn't have much choice.
<s> I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
<s> I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
<s> Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
<s> Tell me the whole story, Walt.
<s> You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
<s> You can cut the bow.
<s> That. It's out of the act.
<s> Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
<s> They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
<s> But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
<s> I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
<s> There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
<s> It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
<s> I did. First and only blow. So far.
<s> Yes, sir?
<s> Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
<s> Stop that, O'Rielly!
<s> I can try, sir.
<s> It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
<s> Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
<s> Yeah, maybe.
<s> Um-hum.
<s> Against what?
<s> Oh, yuh did, huh?
<s> No.
<s> John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Go ahead, open it, open it.
<s> A third party?
<s> Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
<s> Your purse. I need ten dollars.
<s> Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
<s> Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
<s> Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
<s> It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
<s> I remember, distinctly, being fired.
<s> What letter?
<s> In what man!
<s> That's all, Ned. Thank you.
<s> Plus a bonus.
<s> He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
<s> I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
<s> Oh.
<s> No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
<s> I got it all ready. Here.
<s> If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
<s> Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
<s> You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
<s> Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
<s> Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
<s> Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
<s> Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
<s> The heelots!
<s> I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
<s> I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
<s> Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
<s> Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
<s> Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
<s> Better make it doughnuts, huh?
<s> Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
<s> I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
<s> How?
<s> That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
<s> No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
<s> How?
<s> Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
<s> Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah, okay.
<s> Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
<s> You want me to go up with you?
<s> May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
<s> It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
<s> I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
<s> I need to get something straight first.
<s> Am I gettin' the car?
<s> ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
<s> Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
<s> Solis said to keep you clear of this.
<s> Roper...
<s> Roper, we're into it...
<s> Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
<s> You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
<s> Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
<s> Only at the very end.
<s> I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
<s> Furthest point I could find from New York.
<s> Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
<s> We could fill it with water.
<s> Not the ones I'm at.
<s> Around. Barnett's tough competition.
<s> I think so.
<s> I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
<s> So what do I say to this guy?
<s> What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
<s> I'm not good at lying.
<s> So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
<s> How much you wanna bet?
<s> Occasionally you lose.
<s> Damnit!
<s> I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
<s> I ain't interested in your life story.
<s> She's the one to blame. Not me.
<s> Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
<s> Can I come in?
<s> If you did, you never showed it.
<s> Mmm, needs a little something.
<s> It's okay. We broke up.
<s> Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
<s> Hmm?
<s> You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
<s> He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
<s> What?
<s> Depends. What's up?
<s> Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
<s> 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
<s> Yeah, they are but...
<s> True.
<s> Okay...
<s> To live forever.
<s> No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
<s> About what?
<s> Nothing, go back to sleep.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
<s> One would assume so.
<s> Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
<s> It's his nature.
<s> We're going to have to reconfigure.
<s> At least a day.
<s> Who?
<s> But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
<s> Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
<s> -- He won't.
<s> It's not used for anything.
<s> Where?
<s> Insurance.
<s> -- You told me.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know.
<s> This.  No point to it.
<s> There?
<s> -- Waiter.
<s> Access established.
<s> Uplink selected.
<s> I've never been this sore in my life.
<s> I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
<s> Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
<s> Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
<s> ... I just pray we're not too late.
<s> Where did it originate?
<s> Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
<s> NINJA WOLF ZORD!
<s> OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
<s> THERE'S THE COMET!
<s> LET'S FLY!
<s> WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
<s> WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
<s> Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
<s> We could smell it's breath.
<s> Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
<s> You want me to place a few calls?
<s> Quack like a'duck!
<s> GO POWER RANGERS!
<s> Activating Power Scope!
<s> Strength in numbers!!
<s> And I ain't no nigger either!
<s> The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
<s> Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
<s> I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
<s> If we have to.
<s> But if ya can't catch the guys...
<s> Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
<s> If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
<s> What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
<s> Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
<s> Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
<s> I must be going.
<s> It's too late.
<s> Gives us something in common.
<s> It always is.
<s> It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
<s> Guess I'm not a single type guy.
<s> I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
<s> I told you twenty!
<s> It'll just be a few minutes.
<s> Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
<s> He's trying to make it.
<s> You gotta plan these things.
<s> How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
<s> Not if they all die at once.
<s> I must know more of you, my son.
<s> The name's Charlie.
<s> He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
<s> I found that out.
<s> I'll take care of the Boss.
<s> You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
<s> Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
<s> Shuddup.
<s> Guess I'm just lucky.
<s> Anything!
<s> That a Jew compliment?
<s> Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
<s> I don't know. I guess it was...
<s> Stu. That was right about the time we met.
<s> Yeah...before your time.
<s> He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
<s> Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
<s> Sad commentary, huh?
<s> Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
<s> I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
<s> Well - you'd need a body.
<s> Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
<s> Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
<s> Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
<s> I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
<s> Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
<s> A piñata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
<s> Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
<s> You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
<s> But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
<s> Monkeybone...!?
<s> Stu, are you...feeling okay?
<s> You're acting kind of...odd.
<s> I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
<s> I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
<s> They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
<s> Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
<s> Who?
<s> I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
<s> The ring...
<s> Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
<s> Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
<s> Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
<s> I don't <u>know</u>.
<s> IT'S NOT WORKING.
<s> Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
<s> Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
<s> What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
<s> That's why it's good you came to visit me.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
<s> Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
<s> I can make my own decisions.
<s> What does he do?
<s> And where is she?
<s> Forty-five all total.
<s> Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
<s> Thanks very much, sonny--
<s> Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
<s> It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
<s> Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
<s> No!
<s> Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
<s> I would cherish you--and stay sober.
<s> Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
<s> You know--little worms--ambition.
<s> Whadaya mean--*right*?
<s> Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
<s> Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
<s> What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
<s> What do I play?
<s> "There's more light here," he says--
<s> My friends?
<s> Shut up, Diz.
<s> Again? Good idea.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, let's get going.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Right now--everything I own--!
<s> Why me?
<s> Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
<s> Can't that wait, Hubert?
<s> No wonder--without your dinner.
<s> Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
<s> Henry Hill.
<s> Me! Jim--how--?
<s> Y-yes, Jim.
<s> This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
<s> Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
<s> The--head?
<s> Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
<s> Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
<s> Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
<s> Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
<s> The porter's got them. They're coming.
<s> H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
<s> I yield.
<s> Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
<s> No.
<s> Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
<s> Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
<s> Will he *yield*?
<s> The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
<s> Jefferson--
<s> Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
<s> Office of--Senator Smith?
<s> The man downstairs said number--
<s> Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
<s> Convene?
<s> Oh, but this one is so simple.
<s> And with your help--
<s> Tonight.
<s> We're over in the House.
<s> Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
<s> I said--shall we get started *now* or--
<s> Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
<s> Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
<s> No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
<s> Have I?
<s> Why?
<s> Look--I think we ought to skip it.
<s> You win. It's--Clarissa.
<s> No--
<s> Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
<s> Second drawer.
<s> Thanks a lot.
<s> *Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
<s> Wow!
<s> Wait--
<s> Saunders--if there was *any* way--
<s> Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
<s> Splendid.
<s> How'd you like a punch in the nose?
<s> What do you mean? What's going on?
<s> Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
<s> Well, well!
<s> You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yes--
<s> He's lost complete faith in me--
<s> Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
<s> Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
<s> Jim, I won't stand for it.
<s> I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
<s> Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
<s> *I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
<s> Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
<s> What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
<s> Senator Paine.
<s> Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
<s> Order!
<s> Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
<s> Deeds?
<s> Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
<s> No, no children.
<s> No.
<s> No!
<s> They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
<s> Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
<s> Really?
<s> I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm from a small town too, you know.
<s> You have?
<s> He did? I play the tuba—
<s> Sure!
<s> I'd like to read it some time.
<s> Are you? When?
<s> I don't blame you.
<s> No, I don't mind.
<s> Oh, hello darling.
<s> No. It's nothing.
<s> Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
<s> I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
<s> Hello.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
<s> Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
<s> I'm going to tell him the truth.
<s> Come on - let's go!
<s> John—
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh, yes sir.
<s> A smaller bowl of flowers.
<s> That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
<s> Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
<s> Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
<s> Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
<s> Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
<s> What?
<s> I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
<s> Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
<s> Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
<s> Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
<s> You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Entertainment?
<s> Arthur wants to quit!
<s> Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
<s> They can have the Estate.
<s> Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
<s> It isn't? What is it conducted for?
<s> Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
<s> You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
<s> One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
<s> Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
<s> Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
<s> You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
<s> Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
<s> No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
<s> Thank you, Your Honor.
<s> I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
<s> What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Excuse me. What did you say?
<s> That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
<s> I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
<s> What two policemen?
<s> Looking for?
<s> What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
<s> Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
<s> Uh-huh. What are they?
<s> One hundred books?
<s> Why's that?
<s> Not any more.
<s> No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
<s> I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
<s> I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
<s> Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
<s> Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
<s> Good, then go.
<s> You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
<s> It's a thought I had.
<s> What exactly is it supposed to do?
<s> -- Which I don't necessarily agree.
<s> Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
<s> A little.
<s> Oh?
<s> It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
<s> Why do you watch?
<s> ...so accomplished.
<s> That's it? That's what you're giving me?
<s> Sure.
<s> Martin.
<s> Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Why don't you tell me?
<s> Could I see Sofie, please?
<s> Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
<s> I thought only action movies had villains like that.
<s> Of course.
<s> Is something wrong, Sofie?
<s> I don't follow you.
<s> Which show was that?
<s> Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
<s> What?
<s> Where was this?
<s> That's not quite what I said --
<s> What do you want me to see?
<s> Was it something that happened at school?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> What'd he say?
<s> First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
<s> How are you?
<s> Nah... scotch.
<s> Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
<s> Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
<s> Yep.
<s> You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
<s> Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
<s> No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
<s> It's not?
<s> Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
<s> You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
<s> English Lit.
<s> Yes, yes it does...
<s> I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
<s> Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
<s> I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
<s> Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
<s> None of the above, thank you.
<s> Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
<s> You shall see.
<s> That's one way of putting it.
<s> All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
<s> When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
<s> No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
<s> Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
<s> Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
<s> Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Broad?!
<s> Want to know?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> We're about to be shown the way.
<s> Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
<s> And what is that?
<s> It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
<s> FINE.
<s> Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
<s> I was mistaken.
<s> Did you ever see him eat?
<s> Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
<s> He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
<s> I know you did.
<s> I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
<s> Atta, boy!
<s> I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
<s> What did he mean?
<s> It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
<s> Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
<s> I got it.
<s> And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
<s> Against.
<s> Me.
<s> I'm not that kind of girl.
<s> Date?
<s> That was easy. 
<s> Why?
<s> Roy.
<s> It's home.
<s> Monica, where are you?
<s> What?
<s> But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
<s> But there's still only six of us.
<s> Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
<s> With what?
<s> I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
<s> I can't.
<s> Wait!... Look!
<s> The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
<s> Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
<s> Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
<s> He hasn't stolen it yet.
<s> No.
<s> And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
<s> Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
<s> And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Sorry.
<s> But how do we get in?
<s> Through there!
<s> I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
<s> Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
<s> I did, sir.
<s> May I come to the map?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> What do you have in mind?
<s> Properly arranged, yes.
<s> Unhappily, it is true, sire.
<s> But who made this treaty?
<s> It is a terrible shock.
<s> I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
<s> That is incredible.
<s> Yes, sir, I am.
<s> No, sir, none at all.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
<s> You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
<s> I see...
<s> Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
<s> His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
<s> The first reports came in at about ten.
<s> Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
<s> Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
<s> He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
<s> You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
<s> Yes -- an excellent idea.
<s> My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
<s> Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
<s> Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
<s> One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
<s> Are you staying with a friend, sir?
<s> Do you have three francs, sir?
<s> Oh, I'm sorry about that.
<s> You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
<s> I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Where is Madame Trillaud?
<s> I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
<s> I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
<s> My God, what do you think?
<s> God help me -- yes.
<s> I know.
<s> Yes, of course.  What do you want?
<s> You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
<s> Yes, I do -- very much.
<s> Of course, my dear.
<s> We have a treaty with Austria.
<s> What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
<s> He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
<s> No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
<s> It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
<s> If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
<s> With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
<s> A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
<s> Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
<s> You paid cash?
<s> Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
<s> I don't know... I think he went out the back.
<s> That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
<s> That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
<s> Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
<s> You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
<s> I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
<s> Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
<s> Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
<s> I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
<s> You don't know Baby D.
<s> I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
<s> Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
<s> Okay, plan B.
<s> I didn't see nothing.
<s> It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
<s> No, man, just wait.
<s> I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
<s> Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
<s> Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
<s> So what?  Let's make'em wait.
<s> Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
<s> Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
<s> Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
<s> No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
<s> Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
<s> Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
<s> You damn right that's the big one.
<s> Negative...they vamped.
<s> Thanks for the help.
<s> What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
<s> Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
<s> Take your car.
<s> Yeah, and hurry up.
<s> Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
<s> Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
<s> Shut yo' ass up.
<s> What happened here?
<s> Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
<s> The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
<s> I...
<s> My security people are right next door.
<s> It was because I had this...in my pocket
<s> I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
<s> Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
<s> What?
<s> Good.
<s> Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
<s> No, please...
<s> I want'to talk to her.
<s> Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
<s> I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
<s> Over and out.
<s> Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
<s> I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
<s> No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
<s> It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
<s> Don't think I won't.
<s> No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
<s> Everybody does?
<s> My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
<s> Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
<s> Why?
<s> Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
<s> Come with me, honey.
<s> 'Daddy has to go now.
<s> He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
<s> How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
<s> Keep talkin', Preacher.
<s> Not even her?
<s> I will guard Pearl with my life...
<s> How's your sister Pearl?
<s> There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
<s> They hid in a broom closet!
<s> About what!
<s> Sshhh! He's in there.
<s> Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
<s> Icey, I don't want a husband.
<s> It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
<s> John don't like him much.
<s> I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
<s> She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
<s> You better not sing that song.
<s> Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
<s> John! Don't!
<s> Why?
<s> Somewheres. I don't know yet.
<s> Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
<s> She talks to herself.
<s> Dead.
<s> You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
<s> No. No.
<s> Come to me, boy!
<s> All right.
<s> But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
<s> Can I have this?
<s> Pearl and John.
<s> Only she won't never let me play with it.
<s> Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
<s> Harry, what --
<s> Yes.
<s> Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
<s> How'do.
<s> It's about that John and that Pearl?
<s> Where's she at?
<s> Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
<s> How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
<s> What you been up to?
<s> No, nothing.
<s> Since the murder. She was fine before that.
<s> It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
<s> Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
<s> R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
<s> Haven't slept, have you?
<s> Okay, okay.  I think.
<s> And if you can't do that, you sleep.
<s> Hi.
<s> I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
<s> Who?
<s> My dream.
<s> Hi daddy. I know what happened.
<s> Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
<s> I don't mean her --
<s> I won't.
<s> Right.
<s> But that's just not reality, Nancy!
<s> S'curity.
<s> I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
<s> They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
<s> We should get her out of here...
<s> Nobody's gonna kill you.
<s> How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
<s> No.
<s> Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
<s> Have you any money?
<s> From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
<s> No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
<s> Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
<s> You should be more careful, Anna.
<s> As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
<s> Evening gown?
<s> They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
<s> Just for the honeymoon.
<s> Positively not!
<s> Or it might be the firing squad!
<s> Right now it's on the balcony.
<s> But what can we do?... We have to accept.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yes, he looks like a comrade!
<s> Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
<s> That's right... and we might as well face it.
<s> Monsieur.
<s> Which part of the room is mine?
<s> With two f's, if you please.
<s> Good evening, Monsieur.
<s> Go to bed.
<s> I don't feel like any breakfast.
<s> Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
<s> No, sir.
<s> While you eat, you look at the view.
<s> My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
<s> I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
<s> No, no.
<s> Two thousand francs.
<s> She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
<s> No, thank you.
<s> It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
<s> We did our best, Comrade.
<s> No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
<s> Well, we're back home.
<s> That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
<s> She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
<s> You believe in our cause?
<s> But you had!
<s> No visa.
<s> Gladly.
<s> No.
<s> I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
<s> Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
<s> Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
<s> What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
<s> I will do my best.
<s> He takes good care of that.
<s> No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
<s> For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
<s> Thank you. Thank you.
<s> Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
<s> Wounded? How?
<s> I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
<s> Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
<s> It's twelve o'clock.
<s> I don't like your following me.
<s> What?
<s> At what?
<s> Do you like Scotch stories?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
<s> For twelve francs, seventy-five.
<s> A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
<s> Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Ninotchka, I love you.
<s> Ninotchka, you're jealous.
<s> From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
<s> Darling, darling... please!
<s> Please.
<s> Yes, sweetheart. 
<s> The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
<s> If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
<s> Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
<s> How do you do?
<s> No... please...
<s> I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
<s> I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
<s> Has done what?
<s> Hello.
<s> Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
<s> If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
<s> I must ask you to leave.
<s> I told you to go, madame.
<s> Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
<s> I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
<s> That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> This will do. 
<s> Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
<s> You did say it, sir.
<s> Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
<s> You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
<s> Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
<s> Yes ... I got the money.
<s> It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
<s> How so?
<s> Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
<s> No, sir.
<s> The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
<s> No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
<s> Mr. Hoover was a realist.
<s> Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
<s> A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
<s> Sir?
<s> What's Liddy got?
<s> What do you mean, sir?
<s> Sir?
<s> The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
<s> What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
<s> Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
<s> So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
<s> Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
<s> It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
<s> Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
<s> Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
<s> You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
<s> Let him finish, Bob.
<s> Sir?
<s> My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
<s> It's Helms -- it's got to be.
<s> How?
<s> What about the documents he promised?
<s> I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
<s> What ... ?
<s> Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
<s> I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
<s> You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
<s> He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
<s> Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
<s> Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
<s> How about you?  Are you going to win?
<s> It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
<s> It won't.  As long as I'm here.
<s> A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
<s> I won't tell him if you won't.
<s> We'll see about that.
<s> She's quite pretty.
<s> Agreed.
<s> I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
<s> We have to entertain the possibility ...
<s> I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
<s> Yeah ...
<s> How a fat man gets so many girls.
<s> How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
<s> Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
<s> You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
<s> Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
<s> You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
<s> Syracuse.
<s> Hello ...
<s> Elvis I like, too.
<s> She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
<s> Yes, I understand that.
<s> It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
<s> That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
<s> He doesn't want me at the funeral.
<s> We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
<s> I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
<s> No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
<s> But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
<s> Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
<s> Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
<s> Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
<s> No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
<s> The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
<s> How's that?
<s> I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
<s> Yes, you've circled round.
<s> I'm... discouraged.
<s> No ID in her room?
<s> Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
<s> If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
<s> Nothin'?
<s> Some pretty bad people.
<s> It could be.
<s> You sure?
<s> Mm.
<s> That's possible.
<s> I'm hidin' behind you.
<s> So when was he here?
<s> I'm ahead of you there.
<s> I don't know. He ought to...
<s> Yes sir.
<s> The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
<s> No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
<s> Natural to the line of work they was in.
<s> My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
<s> That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
<s> I always am.
<s> Okay.
<s> I can't plan your day.
<s> Well they always is to the party concerned.
<s> Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
<s> I ain't got the money.
<s> No. But I gave my word.
<s> Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
<s> I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
<s> Yes. Things fall into place.
<s> It's full a money.
<s> What? Quit hollerin'.
<s> Just keep it up.
<s> Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> You know what's goin' on?
<s> She'll be all right.
<s> Why would I let you do that?
<s> If you knew, you would have it with you.
<s> Where does he work?
<s> You expect him?
<s> Step out of the car please, sir.
<s> Screwgie.
<s> In the truck.  I'll get it.
<s> No me mate.
<s> You from around here?
<s> Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
<s> I don't need to talk to you.
<s> No. Do you?
<s> Y'all getting any rain up your way?
<s> Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
<s> See about closing.
<s> No.
<s> Everything.
<s> Sir?
<s> Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
<s> What room?
<s> Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
<s> Yes?
<s> I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
<s> Another additional.
<s> Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
<s> I know how he found me.
<s> I know what it is. He won't find me again.
<s> Not any way.
<s> I been immobile.
<s> Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
<s> If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
<s> You do, I reckon.
<s> I got an overcoat on.
<s> No sir.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Yes sir. Two tours.
<s> Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
<s> C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
<s> It's fine. Mind your own meal...
<s> And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
<s> They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
<s> Oww! My arm, careful!
<s> I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
<s> Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
<s> Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
<s> I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
<s> No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
<s> ...I... I know what you are.
<s> WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> I gotta go make dinner.
<s> Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
<s> I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
<s> Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
<s> Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
<s> Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
<s> She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
<s> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
<s> No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
<s> She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
<s> All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
<s> What?
<s> You did? Was it anyone that you...?
<s> Ahh, look, right now's not very...
<s> It's not really a good time, guys...
<s> Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
<s> You mean... George McCord, the actor?
<s> I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
<s> I came for love. My fiancé is here.
<s> Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
<s> Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
<s> Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
<s> How many men have I talked to?
<s> What? Where was he?!
<s> I have no idea what you're talking about.
<s> Fine.
<s> This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
<s> To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
<s> There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
<s> I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
<s> Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
<s> Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
<s> I don't follow...
<s> My socks?
<s> I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
<s> Hell of a way to die.
<s> A mark, huh?
<s> He told us it's in the Buick.
<s> ...that's a good motto.
<s> I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
<s> We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
<s> So what the fuck's a Finn?
<s> Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
<s> What the hell's the matter with you?
<s> I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
<s> I said, 'No.' N-O.
<s> Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
<s> Where? Where is she?
<s> I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
<s> I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
<s> "It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
<s> It just didn't fit her profile...
<s> She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
<s> Man, you have got to get some therapy.
<s> ...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
<s> Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
<s> I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
<s> We know that...
<s> Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
<s> "Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
<s> No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
<s> No! Let me try this!
<s> I SAID FORGET IT!
<s> Better.
<s> You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
<s> Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
<s> She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
<s> I swear to God!
<s> Mr. Campbell?
<s> Waitaminute -
<s> You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
<s> Do not seek the treasure!
<s> Four hundred, Delmar.
<s> I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
<s> I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
<s> Oh my God!
<s> Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
<s> Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
<s> In any state.
<s> Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
<s> I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
<s> ...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
<s> We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
<s> You -
<s> You didn't know that at the time!
<s> Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
<s> ...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
<s> I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
<s> No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
<s> I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
<s> Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
<s> Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
<s> Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
<s> Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
<s> Blooey!
<s> Great.
<s> I joined the Navy.
<s> Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
<s> I never said any of that!
<s> Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
<s> The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
<s> Yes, Joe.
<s> A long time ago.
<s> Not exactly, sir.
<s> What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
<s> Pity you don't have the character.
<s> It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
<s> Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
<s> Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> Well, goodbye.
<s> What are you tired from?
<s> Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
<s> Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
<s> What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
<s> My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
<s> What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
<s> That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
<s> I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
<s> Well, I'll be goddamned.
<s> No. I never feel like that.
<s> That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
<s> Seriously.
<s> Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
<s> Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
<s> You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
<s> My kinda group!
<s> I know who you are and what you want.
<s> Does it still hurt?
<s> Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
<s> Your real father?
<s> Twenty-two years ago.
<s> Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
<s> Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
<s> He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
<s> Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
<s> I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
<s> She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
<s> Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
<s> But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
<s> Not with me.  Not with people.
<s> Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
<s> Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
<s> Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
<s> You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
<s> You know how this gotta end.
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
<s> Different tables.
<s> Pure idiot.
<s> Shut up and let me think.
<s> Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
<s> I did.
<s> They're gonna die in there!
<s> Can we come in?
<s> We'd like to come in.
<s> No ball, kid.
<s> The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
<s> Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
<s> If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
<s> How many more do we have after this?
<s> This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
<s> It doesn't work?!
<s> Don't though. 
<s> I am.  I'm here.
<s> Uh uh.
<s> Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
<s> Fuck that, we've got company...
<s> I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
<s> No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
<s> I got you.
<s> Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
<s> Who's they?
<s> Who? I mean besides the FBI?
<s> Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
<s> Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
<s> No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
<s> Naw... I gotta...
<s> N... N...... Not... Oh.
<s> Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
<s> Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
<s> Jesus...
<s> Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
<s> Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
<s> ...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
<s> And did you witness the shoot-out?
<s> Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
<s> Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
<s> We need money first...
<s> No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
<s> Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
<s> You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
<s> Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
<s> A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
<s> Yeah.
<s> So what's the deal?
<s> I don't know.
<s> No man. Gonna walk.
<s> I'm down.
<s> Right on Brother Judge...
<s> I don't know about that.
<s> You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
<s> Well, act like it. Come on.
<s> Just the legit shit.
<s> Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
<s> What?
<s> Uh... uh... I...
<s> I expect to try.
<s> No, he takes after his mother...
<s> You got me beat on both accounts.
<s> He's my father.
<s> Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
<s> Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
<s> Apology accepted.
<s> Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
<s> Probably.
<s> Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
<s> Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
<s> The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
<s> Not yet.  What happened?
<s> It's already over.
<s> You know how old I am.
<s> No...
<s> She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
<s> What?
<s> Where?
<s> You know what happened.
<s> Go on.
<s> Please.
<s> I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
<s> So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
<s> How many men have we seen die?
<s> They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
<s> Goodbye, Harry.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
<s> That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
<s> I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
<s> For what?
<s> Worse.
<s> When?
<s> Bite?
<s> Yaay!
<s> I will. Come and kiss me.
<s> Well, I thought it was safe--
<s> Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
<s> Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
<s> No more chocolate chip cookies.
<s> Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
<s> Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
<s> And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
<s> Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
<s> Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
<s> Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
<s> Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
<s> Is there quicksand?
<s> Your cairn.
<s> No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
<s> Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
<s> A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
<s> Shit! Look at this mess!
<s> Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
<s> The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
<s> Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
<s> Jesus, the road!
<s> Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
<s> It's beautiful!
<s> Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
<s> I just said--
<s> I got eggs down here!
<s> I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
<s> AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
<s> You can't.  I can.
<s> Say the name, or I slit your throat.
<s> That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
<s> You can go to your grave not knowing.
<s> That so?
<s> Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
<s> Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
<s> Boy overboard!
<s> I can't breathe.
<s> What?
<s> And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
<s> -- then we never would have met.
<s> I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
<s> Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
<s> It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
<s> To the Black Pearl.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
<s> The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
<s> Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
<s> Smith.
<s> I said, no lies.
<s> We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
<s> I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
<s> Somewhat.
<s> Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
<s> Agreed!
<s> So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
<s> 'Bootstrap?'
<s> He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
<s> Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
<s> The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
<s> Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
<s> Yes, I have.
<s> And no lies!
<s> My apologies, Governor.
<s> Bleak.  Very bleak.
<s> Until he's done.
<s> A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
<s> Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
<s> You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
<s> Ain't it.
<s> The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
<s> Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
<s> It's ready now, I know it is.
<s> She let it escape because she wants me to die.
<s> Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
<s> Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
<s> That might work.
<s> In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
<s> Shut up and do it!
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
<s> Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
<s> A man?
<s> Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
<s> Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
<s> No!  Well, not those exact words.
<s> Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
<s> Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
<s> Is that so?
<s> It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
<s> Daniel!
<s> Three days ago it was.
<s> No, why?
<s> Yeah.  Old times.
<s> It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
<s> On the counter.
<s> I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
<s> I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
<s> Oh yes you are!
<s> Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
<s> Yeah, and what might that be?
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
<s> Yes, he might be.
<s> Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
<s> I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
<s> I don't mind her if you don't.
<s> Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
<s> Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
<s> How-di-do.
<s> I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
<s> I'm glad.
<s> Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
<s> Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
<s> Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
<s> Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
<s> Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
<s> Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
<s> Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
<s> Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
<s> Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
<s> Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
<s> But I don't want to meet your gang.
<s> Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
<s> Oh, hello Mother!
<s> I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
<s> All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
<s> You're the Tribune man?
<s> Hey, make up your mind, will you?
<s> A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
<s> Yeah - go on.
<s> Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
<s> Do you call yourself a reporter?
<s> Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
<s> A what?
<s> I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
<s> Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Now Mr. Smith, now please—
<s> Yes.
<s> Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
<s> Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
<s> I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
<s> Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
<s> No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
<s> Right!
<s> Never even been to New Madrid.
<s> Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
<s> Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
<s> No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
<s> Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
<s> Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
<s> Holy jumping swordfish!
<s> Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
<s> And now for that twentieth crack—
<s> Hello, Joe.
<s> Double strength!
<s> Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
<s> Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
<s> Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
<s> Now the lady said you may go—
<s> Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> A bird in a gilded cage?
<s> ... Sex.
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> Bud brought it to me.
<s> I've got to go ...
<s> I don't know.
<s> No I'm not.
<s> It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
<s> Um ... It's ...
<s> Oh, gosh no.
<s> ... Lover's Lane.
<s> Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
<s> I think ... I might be ill ...
<s> What?
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
<s> That's not going to happen!
<s> "Changes."
<s> No. What?
<s> One of those ... big beds?
<s> Yes I did.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
<s> It was accessible to everyone.
<s> Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
<s> But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
<s> Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
<s> Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
<s> Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
<s> Get lost!
<s> Just take deep breaths.
<s> Owns the hardware store.
<s> To who?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
<s> Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
<s> So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
<s> Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
<s> The pages filled in?
<s> That's great.
<s> I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
<s> ... Lover's Lane?
<s> You don't know?
<s> Rain.
<s> It was a prop for the school play ...
<s> Ooomph?
<s> A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
<s> It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
<s> Why?
<s> Why?
<s> Why don't you just take me back without it?
<s> Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
<s> Listen to me!
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Oh--what's the point, Bud?
<s> Just listen to me ...
<s> ... What's that?
<s> I'll never be able to do that.
<s> You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
<s> What's the rush?
<s> Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
<s> Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
<s> You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
<s> Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
<s> This is "Fly With Us?"
<s> I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
<s> It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
<s> No.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I'm gonna call you back.
<s> It's fine, but --
<s> I don't know.
<s> OH MY GOD. Look at that.
<s> -- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
<s> Hi, is this Jack?
<s> Do you like porno movies?
<s> Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
<s> Can I ask you a question?
<s> You don't even know how much it is.
<s> We got disconnected before....
<s> This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
<s> This is not cool.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> It's fine. It was fun, though.
<s> That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
<s> -- well, if you're gonna go --
<s> Sure.
<s> About six months.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm sorry. I thought you said --
<s> Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
<s> Nothing.
<s> You don't think you'll go --
<s> I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ok.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> ...I don't know what you mean....
<s> Lena?
<s> You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
<s> When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
<s> Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
<s> This really looks like Hawaii here.
<s> This is nice.
<s> Can I come home with you when we get there?
<s> It's ok to ask that.
<s> If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
<s> Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
<s> I'm fine, I have your work number.
<s> Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
<s> I know.
<s> ...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
<s> .....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
<s> No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
<s> I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
<s> You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
<s> ....I have seven.
<s> Hi Walter.
<s> That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
<s> Fine, thank you.
<s> ....yes.....
<s> ...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
<s> You're goin' on a trip?
<s> You should go on a trip.
<s> I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
<s> Ok.
<s> What?
<s> Please don't do this.
<s> Alright, alright.
<s> Are you serious with this?
<s> This is a bunch of bullshit.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> You can't be late though.
<s> You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
<s> Uch. Shut up, Dean.
<s> Sorry.
<s> You ready?
<s> Ok.
<s> He did seem a little strange.
<s> Ok.
<s> "One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
<s> "...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
<s> We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
<s> His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
<s> He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
<s> It's not even noon --
<s> What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
<s> But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
<s> Do I have your word?
<s> You always do.
<s> That's enough.
<s> Good day, Marquis.
<s> Because your writing continues, unchecked.
<s> A man after my own heart...
<s> I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
<s> A night spent with the partner of my choice.
<s> Your wig. Remove your wig.
<s> Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
<s> Why was it you never took her by force?
<s> Then it must've been love --
<s> I'm here.
<s> A few indiscretions in his youth.
<s> And his writing?
<s> Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
<s> But he's one among some two hundred wards --
<s> Oh indeed?
<s> It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
<s> Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
<s> I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
<s> And my own.
<s> No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
<s> I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
<s> Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
<s> Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
<s> It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
<s> Yes?
<s> It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
<s> I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
<s> Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
<s> Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
<s> Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
<s> Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
<s> I pray you: be succinct.
<s> Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
<s> I am not a wealthy woman.
<s> What thought is that?
<s> Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
<s> And I in yours.
<s> If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
<s> It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
<s> Forgive me, I beg you --
<s> I'd rather read, thank-you.
<s> No, when I was but a tender lad--
<s> Not you too
<s> So I've been told.
<s> Randolph!
<s> Why is that, Louis?
<s> Don't
<s> How much?
<s> There's nothing to explain
<s> I wanted it
<s> Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
<s> Sir, I-
<s> We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
<s> Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
<s> That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
<s> Can I talk to Hearst?
<s> Showing life
<s> You're a laugh-riot, kid.
<s> Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
<s> The old man has his own way of doing things
<s> No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
<s> Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
<s> I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
<s> Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
<s> They don't have to.
<s> To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
<s> This ain't George's doing--!
<s> Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
<s> I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
<s> Yes.
<s> Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
<s> 800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
<s> And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
<s> Again
<s> Again
<s> Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
<s> "Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
<s> It's just that my movie is so-
<s> Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
<s> Happy birthday.
<s> Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
<s> Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
<s> About what?
<s> Tommy, thanks for coming over.
<s> Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
<s> Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
<s> What?
<s> You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
<s> You heard me, I said hit me.
<s> Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
<s> She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
<s> You know, like bang her or anything?
<s> I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
<s> No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
<s> I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
<s> No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
<s> When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
<s> Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
<s> Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
<s> I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
<s> What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
<s> Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
<s> Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
<s> You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
<s> So what?
<s> I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
<s> Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
<s> Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
<s> Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
<s> I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
<s> Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
<s> It's OK.
<s> If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
<s> Who asked you?
<s> Who asked you?
<s> What're you talking about?
<s> With Salvy, eh?
<s> Yeah --
<s> OK. Talk.
<s> Why don't you just call him?
<s> Don't make no difference no more.
<s> What friends?
<s> Jake, sit down for a minute.
<s> Never felt better.
<s> Excuse me for living.
<s> Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
<s> Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
<s> But his leg!
<s> That's what they call a family problem.
<s> Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
<s> I'll bet it's been done.
<s> Who left -- where?
<s> Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
<s> What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
<s> He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
<s> All the things I hate.
<s> This is Doyle, Jeff.
<s> Your Lisa?
<s> Like an old hambone?
<s> If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
<s> You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
<s> I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
<s> You've got a hormone deficiency.
<s> Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
<s> Lisa Fremont.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> She's just not the girl for me.
<s> People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
<s> There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
<s> Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
<s> She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
<s> Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
<s> And some man will lose his.
<s> You called the police?
<s> And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
<s> Look!
<s> What?
<s> Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
<s> Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
<s> Only because it's expected of her.
<s> -- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
<s> Going on right here. It's a big night.
<s> Tired?
<s> How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
<s> You mean leave the magazine?
<s> That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
<s> Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
<s> Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
<s> She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
<s> Nothing, thank heaven.
<s> Now, Lisa --
<s> Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
<s> There's nothing to see.
<s> And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
<s> To get on home.
<s> Women aren't that unpredictable.
<s> Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
<s> Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
<s> Inside stuff?
<s> I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
<s> Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
<s> I do?
<s> The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
<s> I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
<s> No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
<s> It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
<s> It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
<s> Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
<s> Two minutes.
<s> Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
<s> A new disease.
<s> Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
<s> Somebody find him a knife.
<s> Hi.
<s> Okay.
<s> Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
<s> You still want to go home, Moose?
<s> You make any sandwiches?
<s> Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
<s> Shoot, Jimbo.
<s> Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
<s> You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
<s> I was in it.
<s> Will you wait a minute?
<s> No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
<s> He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
<s> Have some cigars.
<s> He's just loaded, honey.
<s> That's right!
<s> What's that pounding?
<s> He's home.  I heard the car.
<s> Look--just relax, will you?
<s> Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
<s> In my mother's drawer.
<s> I know.  That's why I came back.
<s> I just don't want trouble.
<s> They're still there!
<s> It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
<s> Hey!  How 'bout that!
<s> Get away from me!
<s> I'm here.
<s> Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
<s> They like you.  Okay?
<s> Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
<s> All right, darling.
<s> It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
<s> Grandma?
<s> Mess that kid up?
<s> You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
<s> Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
<s> Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
<s> Where what was.
<s> University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
<s> Oh.
<s> A what?
<s> They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
<s> Neither can I.
<s> I felt like it.
<s> I'm never going back.
<s> I feel as if I'm walking under water.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You don't need to do that.
<s> We have to go back!
<s> Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
<s> He hates me.
<s> Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
<s> I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
<s> Gabriel -- !
<s> Gabriel!
<s> I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
<s> To all those cons...
<s> What, he should see me help you catch him?
<s> That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
<s> No, no --
<s> What.
<s> I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
<s> Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
<s> He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
<s> Nick, what are you --
<s> Canada.
<s> But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
<s> No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
<s> All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
<s> Don't say my name...
<s> They all are. Football's on.
<s> Who wouldn't.
<s> You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
<s> The hell I can't.
<s> I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
<s> Yes!
<s> J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
<s> Bam Bam.
<s> No. It's her brother.
<s> When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
<s> Nick. I been trying to hit you.
<s> You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
<s> Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
<s> What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
<s> How'd you know my name was Rudy.
<s> Leave the tree.
<s> I don't know... what you're...
<s> GO!!!
<s> Mr. Bangs.
<s> Acid-chewer.
<s> That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
<s> My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
<s> My what?!
<s> I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
<s> Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
<s> How do we do that?
<s> DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
<s> Thought you hate your old man.
<s> Good for you. Protein.
<s> Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
<s> Alamo...
<s> GUARD!!!
<s> What? No...
<s> I'm ninety-two years old --
<s> Since when? What the hell is this room?
<s> No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
<s> Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
<s> No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
<s> Where was she from, Compton?
<s> Was he all pissed off?
<s> Really? Who's your P.O.?
<s> Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
<s> That's okay, Eddie, I do.
<s> Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
<s> Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
<s> Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
<s> What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
<s> How can you tell?
<s> What about?
<s> Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
<s> A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
<s> He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
<s> You can do some crazy things with it.
<s> Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
<s> It's a change.
<s> It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
<s> Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
<s> You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
<s> She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
<s> Juicy, junior, real juicy.
<s> Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
<s> Don't ask me that.
<s> He don't believe in it.
<s> Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
<s> You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
<s> Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
<s> I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
<s> Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
<s> What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
<s> How can you be so sure?
<s> Where?
<s> Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
<s> We can't take him to a hospital.
<s> You gotta idea, spit it out.
<s> Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
<s> That fuckin did it!
<s> So you wanna git bit, huh?
<s> This is what he was doin'.
<s> Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
<s> No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
<s> You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
<s> Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
<s> Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
<s> In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He's learning his letters.
<s> Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
<s> His letters will keep.
<s> I suppose it is.
<s> So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> It's going to Sonora.
<s> Hurry up.
<s> Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
<s> To the other side of the street.
<s> A man I used to know.
<s> No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
<s> And meet him there.
<s> I won't again.
<s> That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
<s> You better start.
<s> Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
<s> You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
<s> Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
<s> Three men on matched roans?
<s> All right, you didn't know.
<s> What's there to be fair about?
<s> Nobody asked you to.
<s> If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
<s> You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
<s> Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
<s> Depends on how good you drive.
<s> Maybe in Sonora.
<s> Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
<s> Stop it --
<s> Where is he?
<s> Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
<s> Don't you even know your letters?
<s> No.
<s> Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
<s> You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
<s> Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
<s> Alex, what are you doing?
<s> Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
<s> You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
<s> It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
<s> What?! What is it, a monster?!
<s> Hello Ray.
<s> Ray, have you been here all this time?
<s> No, stay.
<s> Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
<s> He's so brave.
<s> Thanks. I'm Cindy.
<s> Open chest!!!
<s> Then what kinda stuff can we do?
<s> It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
<s> Huh?
<s> Well... okay... but only as a friend.
<s> I know, but I've been thinking --
<s> Then what are we going to do?
<s> Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
<s> Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
<s> So, whatever happened to her?
<s> It's okay.
<s> I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
<s> Um, I'm not touching anything.
<s> Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
<s> Just wait, you'll see.
<s> Alright, let's take a vote...
<s> My child, you're alive!
<s> My child you are the only survivor.
<s> Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
<s> Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
<s> Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
<s> Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
<s> I told you it would taste just like chicken.
<s> That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
<s> Let me see the files.
<s> Are these all the subjects?
<s> Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
<s> What's this?
<s> How are we going to get them all up there?
<s> In about fifteen minutes.
<s> Right. What about condoms?
<s> Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
<s> Yes, I thought that it would be best.
<s> Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
<s> Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
<s> Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
<s> Just a little Rogaine.
<s> Oh, I couldn't do that.
<s> That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
<s> I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
<s> How is she?
<s> Soon. First, I must bless this house.
<s> Then let us prepare.
<s> Because she will lie?
<s> No, I'm fine.
<s> Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
<s> Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
<s> What happened?
<s> That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
<s> Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
<s> Jeeezzz!
<s> Why?
<s> She sure can pick 'em!
<s> But, Chip...
<s> This is so silly. 
<s> Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
<s> Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
<s> And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
<s> I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
<s> I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
<s> Oohhhh, Eugene!
<s> Ooohhhh!
<s> You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
<s> What a mess.
<s> It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
<s> Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
<s> Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
<s> Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
<s> GODDAMN YOU!
<s> PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
<s> Socially... I'll have a beer.
<s> I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
<s> You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
<s> Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
<s> We all have bad nights. 
<s> Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
<s> I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
<s> ...Browsing.
<s> I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
<s> Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
<s> Sure I do.
<s> Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
<s> Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
<s> Can we go there now?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
<s> She can only use cash.
<s> For the time being, I imagine that must do.
<s> She showed me a drawing.
<s> Then you know where Jacqueline is?
<s> Why?
<s> There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
<s> It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
<s> That you love Mary.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> You will die.
<s> Devil worshippers!
<s> It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
<s> I have to go —-
<s> It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
<s> He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
<s> They may have been friends of hers.
<s> I keep telling myself that.
<s> I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
<s> But why come to me?
<s> Uh—huh.
<s> I should like people to read what I've written.
<s> You don't expect me to do that do you?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> You know where she is?
<s> A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
<s> Unless what?
<s> You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
<s> I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
<s> No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
<s> I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
<s> No. Why?
<s> Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
<s> I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
<s> Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
<s> No.
<s> Kids? What about them?
<s> Agreed.
<s> Impotent.
<s> Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
<s> Nothing I can't finish later.
<s> Videotapes.
<s> Can we look at one?
<s> Maybe you want to go.
<s> I know.
<s> I know.
<s> Why not?
<s> What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
<s> Sometimes. Afterward.
<s> Why?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> So you lied to her?
<s> I'm not in love with you.
<s> Why not?
<s> No.
<s> I don't know. Possibly.
<s> I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
<s> I don't care.
<s> Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
<s> Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
<s> But I'm not.
<s> Always the lawyer.
<s> I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
<s> Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
<s> I want out of this marriage.
<s> Yes.
<s> You bitch. I knew it.
<s> Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
<s> But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
<s> Did you confront John about the visitor?
<s> What do you mean? I don't understand.
<s> But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
<s> Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
<s> He doesn't have a phone.
<s> What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
<s> Well, what, then?
<s> Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
<s> You touched him?
<s> I can't believe you did that!!
<s> So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
<s> What is it?
<s> No.
<s> She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
<s> She still is.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> No.
<s> Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
<s> My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
<s> No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
<s> Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
<s> Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
<s> Is that what he tells you?
<s> Okay.
<s> Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
<s> Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
<s> She's there? What's she doing there?
<s> I like the way he dresses.
<s> I wish you hadn't done that.
<s> I just... Ann is very...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
<s> Did he put you up to this?
<s> Graham.
<s> I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
<s> God, you... you're mean.
<s> I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
<s> It'll just be me.
<s> Or go someplace in a hurry.
<s> Goddamit...
<s> John Millaney.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
<s> Was he nice to you?
<s> I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
<s> Sure.
<s> No, nothing.
<s> Uh, OK. Sure.
<s> Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> OK. But late.
<s> A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
<s> Down to the incinerator.
<s> What do you want to call me at the office for?
<s> We live in 703.
<s> Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
<s> But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
<s> Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
<s> OK. I'll think about it.
<s> It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
<s> No? How come?
<s> It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
<s> I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
<s> I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
<s> WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
<s> BREAKING OUT
<s> BREAKING OUT
<s> BREAKING OUT
<s> Fools!
<s> No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
<s> Who trusts experts?
<s> Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
<s> No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
<s> What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
<s> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
<s> YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
<s> Absolutely correct.
<s> It's...
<s> Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm sorry, Officer.
<s> YOUNG BLOOD
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> Fabulous!
<s> I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
<s> I don't think he intends to go that far.
<s> Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
<s> And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
<s> YOU'RE NO GOOD
<s> YOU'RE NO GOOD
<s> WHAT A JOKE...
<s> CRIMINAL
<s> ...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
<s> LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
<s> Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
<s> I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
<s> Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
<s> And?
<s> What are you pouring tonight?
<s> A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
<s> Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
<s> You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
<s> Sure I know Maya. Real well.
<s> I know. I might need to be spanked.
<s> Good. How're you?
<s> Me too.
<s> No, we're paying for the wine.
<s> You said you had it all lined up.
<s> I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
<s> It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
<s> As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
<s> Let me call Christine.
<s> I owe her a call anyway.
<s> Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
<s> Yeah, that would be a good move.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> You know her?
<s> Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
<s> With Maya?
<s> I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
<s> Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
<s> If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
<s> I'm fine!
<s> Count me out.
<s> Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
<s> Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
<s> Understanding of what?
<s> And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
<s> Can you give me some room here?
<s> I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> What exactly are we going to do?
<s> He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
<s> Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
<s> I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Huh. Let me think.
<s> Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
<s> What's that?
<s> I don't know. I wouldn't know.
<s> You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
<s> Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
<s> What?
<s> Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
<s> Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
<s> Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
<s> The plan is... you go.
<s> My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
<s> You need a new car anyway.
<s> Twelve months in oak.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> How long have you been into wine?
<s> Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
<s> Yeah. Thanks.
<s> A paper?
<s> My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Good. So did I.
<s> It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
<s> Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
<s> Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
<s> So how're you doing?
<s> So what's happening with your book?
<s> About four weeks.
<s> Quaffable but far from transcendent.
<s> Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
<s> Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
<s> Where?
<s> Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
<s> I just got divorced. Phyllis.
<s> This one?
<s> It tastes funny.
<s> Me too.
<s> Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
<s> Are you going to do this or what?
<s> Yes, it was.
<s> The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
<s> They already know we're here.
<s> Me too.
<s> It's old Morgan.
<s> It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
<s> Who wrote this book?
<s> That means they're unemployed.
<s> I just asked his name.
<s> Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
<s> Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
<s> The footprints.
<s> There are none.
<s> What was the first thing?
<s> It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
<s> He definitely wasn't a midget.
<s> Six months.
<s> Posse? What the hell you talking about?
<s> ...And you had to kill him?
<s> What friend is that?
<s> Your next water ain't for three days.
<s> McKendrick.
<s> Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
<s> Is he alive?
<s> Have you thought at all about your plans?
<s> They've been kind to me.
<s> How's Mr. Parker doing?
<s> I already did that.
<s> My name is Emmett.
<s> I haven't done anything.
<s> I'll be long gone.
<s> Not for five years.
<s> Going to Turley, was it?
<s> I expect.
<s> Which way do you mean?
<s> Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
<s> You haven't got any money.
<s> Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
<s> Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
<s> Believe it.
<s> What's that?
<s> Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
<s> We didn't get that far.
<s> He'll be here.
<s> Howdy.
<s> So this is the guy you're going to hang?
<s> I don't have any family any more.
<s> Rae, I need help.
<s> Good luck, Mal.
<s> Lucky.
<s> Where's Emmett now?
<s> Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
<s> I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
<s> I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
<s> Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
<s> You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
<s> It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
<s> -- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
<s> How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
<s> I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
<s> Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
<s> She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
<s> "Forever".
<s> She'll drive herself.
<s> What about it?
<s> Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
<s> You really think so?
<s> Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
<s> Soon.  Soon.
<s> Viktor, you should have said something.
<s> No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
<s> I do?
<s> She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
<s> Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
<s> Not quite.
<s> Impossible.
<s> No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
<s> No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
<s> Not if I don't let her.
<s> Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
<s> Well, I --
<s> I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
<s> Who are you really?
<s> We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
<s> You never were together, Hal.
<s> -- Please, get away from me.
<s> That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
<s> That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
<s> Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
<s> I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
<s> She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
<s> -- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
<s> Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
<s> I do okay.  How about you?
<s> I noticed.
<s> I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
<s> No, that was me.
<s> I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
<s> This is the story.
<s> Abduction?
<s> I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
<s> -- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
<s> Yes.
<s> Good.
<s> I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
<s> -- What you don't understand --
<s> Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
<s> You know what I'm talking about.
<s> Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
<s> Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
<s> We can keep it in the bathroom.
<s> What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
<s> I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
<s> Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
<s> They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
<s> Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
<s> You mean aneurysm.
<s> That I'm a freak.
<s> No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
<s> I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
<s> Them?
<s> Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
<s> Where will you go, where no one has died?
<s> What?
<s> Lots of things.
<s> I'm ready to communicate with you now.
<s> Yes.
<s> Standing next to my window.
<s> They were the ones who hanged everybody.
<s> You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
<s> It's our pleasure.
<s> J. C. Penny's?
<s> Which street corner?
<s> The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
<s> Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
<s> He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
<s> I could. You sucked.
<s> Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
<s> All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
<s> I thought you said two hundred.
<s> She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
<s> I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
<s> Who? Us?!
<s> Who you callin' "boy?"
<s> Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
<s> Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
<s> Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
<s> Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
<s> About what?
<s> Then why go back now?
<s> I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
<s> Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
<s> You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
<s> Don't look.
<s> Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
<s> Like what?
<s> Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
<s> CARL??? Carl did this?!!
<s> Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
<s> That's not funny.
<s> Whatcha' doin'?
<s> Just checking out the lights.
<s> New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
<s> Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
<s> Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
<s> Yeah. Good.
<s> You took Bill.
<s> Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
<s> We're coming your way, man!
<s> Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
<s> Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
<s> Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
<s> Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
<s> Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
<s> Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
<s> Brought you munchies.
<s> Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
<s> What can I do you for?
<s> Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
<s> I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
<s> Out.
<s> Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
<s> Your what?
<s> If...?
<s> America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
<s> What do you think?
<s> All sound reasons for matrimony.
<s> Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
<s> I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
<s> Driving?
<s> Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
<s> Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
<s> Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
<s> You want to lose this putz or not?!?
<s> Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
<s> Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
<s> The minute you see him, you'll know.
<s> Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
<s> Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
<s> Well, thanks for the lift.
<s> Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
<s> That's me.
<s> If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
<s> Running blocker.
<s> Go.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
<s> They're jammed!
<s> Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
<s> This is Bandit I, come back.
<s> On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
<s> What does the old Timex say?
<s> I'm at marker eight-five.
<s> I'll believe it when I see it.
<s> Go breaker.
<s> Go head on, breaker.
<s> Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
<s> Believe me, that won't be a problem.
<s> Chickenshit money.
<s> -- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
<s> -- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
<s> Of course. Yes.
<s> Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
<s> Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
<s> All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
<s> That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
<s> Yeah.
<s> -- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
<s> Uh, yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And threw us into the lake.
<s> Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
<s> I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
<s> I'm not doing cocaine.
<s> Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
<s> That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
<s> Then what --
<s> Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
<s> That's right! RIGHT NOW!
<s> That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
<s> I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
<s> -- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
<s> It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
<s> Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
<s> But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
<s> No... We're trying to save Heller.
<s> Nah, nuthin' on my end --
<s> That's the punchline, y'ready?
<s> None whatsoever.
<s> Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
<s> -- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
<s> Got hit twice.
<s> Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
<s> I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
<s> ...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
<s> I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
<s> You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
<s> What!?
<s> No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
<s> What?
<s> ...What are they doin' right now...?
<s> He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
<s> All right.
<s> The same thing that could happen to any of us.
<s> He's dead.
<s> How much sleep?
<s> And professionally?
<s> To who?
<s> I don't know.
<s> -- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
<s> Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
<s> But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
<s> Human beings can die.
<s> I love her.
<s> To calm your anxiety.
<s> Yes.
<s> Rheya.  Not here.
<s> Let's go home.
<s> I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
<s> Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
<s> You don't love me.
<s> That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
<s> Do you?
<s> I can't stay here.
<s> Who are you, then?
<s> I want to stop taking those pills.
<s> I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
<s> We want to talk freely.
<s> Hello, Win.
<s> They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
<s> Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
<s> He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
<s> Beg pardon?
<s> Listen, that was my fault.
<s> Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
<s> Absolutely.  Look at this.
<s> Sleep good.
<s> They called here after you left...
<s> Not exactly.
<s> No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
<s> Do you dance?
<s> It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
<s> Yeah.  It's all over.
<s> So.
<s> I don't know...
<s> You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
<s> Just putting in an appearance then.
<s> Claire...
<s> What?
<s> You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
<s> Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
<s> I think -- she's crazy.
<s> I had to follow her to a store.
<s> Ellie, it was a formal party...
<s> Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
<s> I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
<s> What's the difference?
<s> What about Tommy?
<s> He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
<s> She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
<s> Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
<s> I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
<s> Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
<s> Lay back, Mack.
<s> She's taking singing lessons.
<s> She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
<s> We're gonna pass the street.
<s> I was sort of hoping to get out of--
<s> They'll never take me alive.
<s> Don't be pitiful.
<s> Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
<s> Mr. Jameson--
<s> Frmpph-yrr.
<s> Hmf-hrr?
<s> A spider.  Eight legs.
<s> How about tomorrow?
<s> Thanks, I already ate.
<s> I hate people with alliterative names.
<s> Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
<s> But you like that in a man?
<s> I'd never admit that.
<s> I'm sure you kept warm.
<s> Do you mind if I come too?
<s> I know what you mean.  I...
<s> Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
<s> Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
<s> Nah.
<s> Any sign of our friend?
<s> It'll shut itself off.
<s> How is he?
<s> I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
<s> No!
<s> I will finish what I've begun…
<s> Really, Professor, I--
<s> Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
<s> No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
<s> Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
<s> Phooey on that.
<s> I'm not so happy myself.
<s> Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
<s> No, no!  Not there!
<s> Is you all good Nazis?
<s> I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
<s> Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
<s> Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
<s> Looks good outside.
<s> Who is it?
<s> Yeah. Security.
<s> How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
<s> Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
<s> You stink, Sefton!
<s> Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
<s> And maybe a little something else?
<s> Why not?
<s> How much more do we have to take from him?
<s> Twenty-five.
<s> Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
<s> Sefton!
<s> What are the chances busting out of here?
<s> I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
<s> The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
<s> All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
<s> Then droppen Sie dead!
<s> Stop it, Harry!
<s> Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
<s> Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
<s> Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
<s> You're teasing me again!
<s> So what? There's other women!
<s> So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
<s> This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
<s> I'll open mine, too.
<s> Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
<s> Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
<s> Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
<s> Are we boring you?
<s> I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
<s> We did it.
<s> So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
<s> Nothing for Kuzawa?
<s> Just what makes you so popular?
<s> Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
<s> Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
<s> Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
<s> What time?
<s> Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
<s> All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
<s> You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
<s> How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
<s> And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
<s> Who's the guy, Schulz?
<s> Yes, you do!
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
<s> I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
<s> I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
<s> Twelve years, sir.
<s> When is it expected back?
<s> I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
<s> But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
<s> Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
<s> Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
<s> Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
<s> It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
<s> Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
<s> That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
<s> I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
<s> It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
<s> One minute to warp core breach.
<s> I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
<s> I'll go. You have the Bridge.
<s> There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
<s> Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
<s> Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
<s> Yes, where would you go?
<s> I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
<s> Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
<s> You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
<s> What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
<s> Phasing? To where?
<s> A photon torpedo?
<s> Make it so.
<s> You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
<s> As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
<s> The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
<s> Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
<s> The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
<s> Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
<s> And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
<s> Execute!
<s> He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
<s> Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
<s> Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
<s> Locate.
<s> On screen.
<s> It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
<s> Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
<s> You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
<s> Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
<s> Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
<s> I'll handle that later.
<s> But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
<s> Not exactly.
<s> I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
<s> ... How long?
<s> Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
<s> We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
<s> Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
<s> I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
<s> Aye, sir!
<s> They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
<s> But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
<s> Yes. And I know you.
<s> Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
<s> About a dozen officers and men.
<s> Come on!
<s> Go, Sulu!
<s> Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
<s> Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
<s> That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
<s> Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
<s> Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
<s> Any time.
<s> Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
<s> 
<s> All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
<s> You should take the Vulcan, too.
<s> "Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
<s> Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
<s> ... Yes...
<s> I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
<s> Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
<s> Wait!... Wait...
<s> 
<s> You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
<s> It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
<s> They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
<s> More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
<s> Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
<s> Amazing! I don't know what to say --
<s> Thank you.
<s> Ah.
<s> This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
<s> It's like the Garden of Eden...
<s> I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
<s> Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
<s> Why? Why didn't you tell me?
<s> Is that a poem?
<s> Maybe...
<s> Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
<s> Mother, go back!
<s> But we can't just sit here -- !
<s> Never mind! Hurry!
<s> Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
<s> You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
<s> Oh, I believe it.
<s> Let them eat static.
<s> We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
<s> Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
<s> I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
<s> KHAN!
<s> Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
<s> Scotty, let's have it.
<s> Admiral --
<s> Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
<s> Yes, SIR.
<s> The word is given: warp speed.
<s> The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
<s> How far?
<s> Be careful, Jim...
<s> Best we could do in two hours.
<s> Uhura, patch me in --
<s> He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
<s> The ship -- out of danger?
<s> Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
<s> Because... there was no way to win.
<s> As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
<s> It is still regulation, Admiral.
<s> Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
<s> You may ask, Lieutenant.
<s> Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
<s> We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
<s> If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
<s> '... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
<s> At what.
<s> Understood, sir.
<s> Aye, sir --
<s> Scotty!
<s> Battle stations.
<s> Course heading, Captain?
<s> No power to the weapons system, sir.
<s> Where must you go?
<s> Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
<s> Gillian --
<s> I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
<s> We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
<s> Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
<s> Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
<s> Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
<s> Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
<s> I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
<s> A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
<s> Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
<s> Acceleration is no longer a constant.
<s> No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
<s> It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
<s> Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
<s> Name?
<s> You play games with me and you're through
<s> I'm wery sorry, but --
<s> I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
<s> Sir, heat shields at maximum!
<s> Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
<s> We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
<s> Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
<s> LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
<s> A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
<s> Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
<s> How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
<s> You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
<s> Hm?
<s> All right. The truth?
<s> Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
<s> Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
<s> You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
<s> The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
<s> There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
<s> Explain.
<s> How do you know this...?
<s> Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
<s> Ah... The giants.
<s> Yes?
<s> Exaggerate.
<s> The hell I can't
<s> No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
<s> Right.  Will you help us?
<s> No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
<s> I will, Admiral.
<s> Steady as she goes...
<s> Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
<s> We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
<s> Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
<s> Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
<s> 283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
<s> Out of control, and blind as a bat!
<s> Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
<s> Humpbacked - people.?
<s> Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
<s> Mr. Sulu?
<s> How long, Scotty?
<s> Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
<s> Admiral, you'll be trapped!
<s> Millions?
<s> That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
<s> Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
<s> Sulu Hikaru.
<s> Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
<s> Then you must spend your life answering questions.
<s> Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
<s> I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
<s> You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
<s> There are caves in those mountains.
<s> This way!
<s> I'll be here.
<s> For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
<s> I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
<s> I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
<s> But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
<s> No.
<s> The artificial lifeform was right?
<s> Yes. But look at this medscan...
<s> It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
<s> I don't know.
<s> He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
<s> ... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
<s> A planet in Federation space...
<s> Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
<s> What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
<s> No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
<s> Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
<s> Do you have everything you need from command?
<s> The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
<s> It's nothing. I'm just tired.
<s> The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
<s> Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
<s> Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
<s> We're through running from these bastards.
<s> We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
<s> Commander Riker...
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> No, we're here to... rescue them.
<s> We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
<s> Make it so.
<s> Beam him out!
<s> No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
<s> No, sir...
<s> No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
<s> Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
<s> Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
<s> Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
<s> What...?
<s> No children?
<s> ... I believe you...
<s> They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
<s> It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
<s> Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
<s> Not yet.
<s> If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
<s> I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
<s> Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
<s> It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
<s> I wish to... go back to the way I was.
<s> No... no, please... you cannot...
<s> Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
<s> What?
<s> I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
<s> Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
<s> Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
<s> Always am.
<s> One minute to warp threshold...
<s> Active.
<s> There's a few of us left.
<s> Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
<s> Yes, he is.
<s> You're lying.
<s> Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> On screen.
<s> We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
<s> Fire.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Unless you'd like to stay.
<s> Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
<s> They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
<s> We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
<s> Where the hell are they going?
<s> Hold that thought.
<s> Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
<s> Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
<s> We DO sleep lying down.
<s> Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
<s> We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
<s> That's the question -
<s> I wish I knew. Uhura?
<s> Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
<s> I didn't mean this future.
<s> No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
<s> No way.  You see this?
<s> She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
<s> Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
<s> If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
<s> Very much.
<s> How can I trust --
<s> Yes...
<s> Those words WERE spoken by me.
<s> Yes.
<s> I am.
<s> Your honors, the State rests.
<s> Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
<s> Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
<s> Shields up. Battle stations.
<s> Aye, sir; thrusters...
<s> Shields up, Captain --?
<s> Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
<s> She programmed the torpedo hits?
<s> Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
<s> Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
<s> Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
<s> We must do this again soon.
<s> We didn't kill Gorkon.
<s> Anything else you want to tell me?
<s> There's gotta be a way out of this place...
<s> Where do we come in?
<s> Possibly.
<s> Candidate for what?
<s> Energize...
<s> Captain, if --
<s> Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
<s> Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
<s> Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
<s> I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
<s> You hear that?
<s> We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
<s> We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
<s> I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
<s> I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
<s> Who else?
<s> Faith...?
<s> A lie?
<s> Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
<s> You having hearing problems, mister?
<s> We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
<s> That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
<s> If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
<s> This one can.
<s> How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
<s> You are me.
<s> For how long?
<s> He turned out all right.
<s> That was another time.
<s> To happy endings.
<s> Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
<s> Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
<s> On my way.
<s> At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
<s> Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
<s> How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
<s> An individual more like you, you mean.
<s> It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
<s> As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
<s> I know how he thinks.
<s> Theories?
<s> Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
<s> He wants to look me in the eye.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> On screen.
<s> 
<s> A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
<s> Not with the Romulans.
<s> Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
<s> What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
<s> Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
<s> Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
<s> Counselor?
<s> Away team. Transporter room four.
<s> Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
<s> Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
<s> You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
<s> And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
<s> No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
<s> New worlds.
<s> I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
<s> In time.
<s> I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
<s> Why are you here?
<s> You know that's not possible.
<s> Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
<s> Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
<s> So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
<s> You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
<s> Should I raise shields?
<s> Let's go.
<s> She is here.
<s> Silence, Romulan!
<s> 
<s> And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
<s> It's still the full price.
<s> Eh... yes.
<s> Elmo's...
<s> Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
<s> What do you mean by 'contain?'
<s> We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
<s> We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
<s> When can we expect containment?
<s> It's taken on a disguise.
<s> You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
<s> I'm afraid we can't let you go.
<s> Shermin!! Shermin!!!
<s> Watch it. They're coming out.
<s> I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
<s> Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
<s> Don't... don't do this... please...
<s> Flashlight.
<s> Pancakes.
<s> Smile.
<s> No gas.
<s> I know.
<s> My... husband.
<s> Shit!
<s> Horses.
<s> Music.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
<s> What?
<s> It was a mistake.
<s> No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
<s> I understand.
<s> You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
<s> Horses.
<s> No.
<s> I gave you a baby last night.
<s> But...
<s> What for?
<s> I know how to gamble now.
<s> I want to get money for you and the baby.
<s> If you want to keep it, you can.
<s> You want the baby to laugh at me.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> I'm never going to see you again, am I?
<s> Call the police!!
<s> Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
<s> He doesn't understand... just walk away...
<s> Pull over. I've got to get back there.
<s> Sure.
<s> Give it a rest, Lyman.
<s> No.
<s> People have made mistakes in these situations before.
<s> We better get it into the box. Come on...
<s> It was a man though... right?
<s> It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
<s> Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> No.
<s> Judy, that's stupid.
<s> You know that's impossible!
<s> Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
<s> I wouldn't think so.
<s> Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
<s> Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
<s> Leave him alone, Tran.
<s> Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
<s> I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
<s> Fuck you.
<s> What're you going to do?
<s> I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
<s> Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
<s> I just got to talk to you for one second.
<s> Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
<s> Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
<s> Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
<s> Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
<s> Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
<s> We should talk alone.
<s> Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
<s> You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
<s> Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
<s> I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
<s> So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
<s> All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
<s> This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
<s> What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
<s> You bet.  Did you like it?
<s> You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
<s> Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
<s> What?
<s> Faith, can I talk to you a second?
<s> That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
<s> Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
<s> Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
<s> No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
<s> Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
<s> Let's talk in the car.
<s> I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
<s> I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
<s> No, you're just trying to get off.
<s> Look, I gotta get some sleep.
<s> She's my destiny.
<s> You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
<s> Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
<s> Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
<s> The gas tank's going to go any second!
<s> How long does it last?  Oh.
<s> I'm not going.
<s> Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
<s> Uh unh.
<s> Then we'll be right where we are now.
<s> Yeah.  We did.
<s> See you downtown.
<s> Um... he was older.
<s> Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
<s> Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
<s> No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
<s> I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
<s> Winona.
<s> I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
<s> This is Agent Mackelway.
<s> Whole country or just hereabouts?
<s> You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
<s> Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
<s> Why me? What do you want from me!?
<s> I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
<s> What's with the eyelids?
<s> Just an observer.
<s> Maybe cause he's smart.
<s> Another what?
<s> I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
<s> Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
<s> How long ago?
<s> What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
<s> An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
<s> I understand.
<s> There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
<s> Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
<s> You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
<s> Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
<s> Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
<s> Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
<s> That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
<s> "Gone live?"
<s> This is some serious shit.
<s> You got a point there.
<s> And one other thing.
<s> He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
<s> Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
<s> I know.
<s> We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
<s> You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
<s> No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
<s> Slow down a second, you met with Low --
<s> And you're working with him?
<s> I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
<s> Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
<s> I'm going to Amarillo.
<s> Kulok.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
<s> He's moved on to TV.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Whatever happened to MyDick?
<s> [The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
<s> [Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
<s> [And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
<s> So you're the new meat?
<s> Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
<s> The same.
<s> What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
<s> You're right. I know.
<s> I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
<s> You're a comedian?
<s> Nikki.
<s> I thought real men don't like quiche.
<s> Tell me about it...
<s> What else is going on?
<s> ...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
<s> They were auditioning for the same role as you?
<s> What an asshole.
<s> I'm a comedian.
<s> You want this in black chips.
<s> Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
<s> Why not?
<s> We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
<s> If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
<s> ...Nah. I'm right across the street...
<s> ...The red piece of shit over there...
<s> You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What kind of things?
<s> I thought you met someone else.
<s> Really?
<s> Why didn't you call?
<s> Goodbye. I lov... 
<s> Right.
<s> Right... or more likely the opposite.
<s> I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
<s> There's the rub.
<s> It's a gig.
<s> You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
<s> Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
<s> I don't know. Eight or Nine.
<s> Classy.
<s> I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
<s> Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
<s> Ah, there's the rub...
<s> I'll be your winger.
<s> Oh boy.
<s> Well, you're doing so well...
<s> They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
<s> I didn't make it...
<s> Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
<s> ...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
<s> Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
<s> Make someone bleed.
<s> I don't know...
<s> You're crazy.
<s> I'm not going to Vegas.
<s> Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
<s> I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
<s> That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
<s> She smiled baby.
<s> Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
<s> You think they're watching?
<s> I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
<s> What an asshole.
<s> That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
<s> Did she, or did she not smile.
<s> Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
<s> That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
<s> Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
<s> Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
<s> I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
<s> How?
<s> ...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
<s> I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
<s> You could make their heads bleed, though.
<s> ...Is he brown?
<s> ...How novel.
<s> No.
<s> You are so money, and you don't even know it...
<s> ...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
<s> ...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
<s> Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
<s> ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
<s> Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
<s> Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
<s> ...it's on.
<s> You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
<s> Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
<s> Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
<s> I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
<s> Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
<s> How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
<s> You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
<s> OK, but be careful.
<s> The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
<s> Maybe, or you gotta know now.
<s> Sure.
<s> On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
<s> Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
<s> Maybe I can help.
<s> No.
<s> You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
<s> Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
<s> Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
<s> Yes.
<s> This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
<s> This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
<s> Okay.  One minute.
<s> We're all tired...
<s> Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
<s> Can you do it Mike?
<s> Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
<s> I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
<s> Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
<s> Not so perfectly if you noticed.
<s> How is your father?
<s> Wake me up when you come to bed?
<s> How's Mom?
<s> Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
<s> To the city.
<s> Cut it out.
<s> They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
<s> Probably a year...
<s> I do renounce him.
<s> Be patient.
<s> No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
<s> He talked to you?
<s> Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
<s> Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
<s> Well, we ate everything without you.
<s> Is that good?
<s> Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
<s> Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
<s> It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
<s> Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
<s> That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
<s> I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
<s> No! I've got more than one shirt!
<s> Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
<s> Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
<s> No!
<s> I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
<s> Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
<s> I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
<s> I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
<s> To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
<s> That's good.
<s> Ripley's plans.
<s> Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
<s> I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
<s> Marge and I are getting married.
<s> You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
<s> What evening?
<s> Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
<s> It's Freddie. Let me in.
<s> I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
<s> Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
<s> I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
<s> Far cry from New York.
<s> You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
<s> I absolutely agree with Marge.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> What about Cortina?
<s> I'll go and see what's the matter.
<s> I think you're right.
<s> Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
<s> Get on. I'll take you to him.
<s> Hello Marge!
<s> Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
<s> And you, sir? Any better?
<s> Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
<s> What?
<s> I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
<s> Why? When?
<s> Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
<s> He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
<s> Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
<s> Emily.  Just kidding.
<s> What?
<s> Is Freddie in Rome?
<s> Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
<s> Okay then, you're crazy.
<s> He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
<s> Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
<s> Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
<s> Ten thirty?
<s> It's okay.
<s> It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
<s> No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
<s> Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
<s> No key, huh?
<s> You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
<s> Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
<s> Was who Meredith?
<s> You're such a liar...
<s> I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
<s> Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
<s> What about Thomas Ripley?
<s> November, I thought.
<s> Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
<s> I can believe that.
<s> No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
<s> If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
<s> Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
<s> It keeps ya busy.
<s> I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
<s> He'll, what else can I do with it all?
<s> I mean porno movies.
<s> My God!
<s> Keep it.
<s> Hello, Betsy.
<s> Just didn't get around to it, huh?
<s> Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
<s> This is gotta be a game, right?
<s> Is he Italian?
<s> Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
<s> With the other hand, right?
<s> I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
<s> Awh, come off it, Pal.
<s> Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
<s> Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
<s> And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
<s> Stick up?
<s> No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
<s> It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
<s> Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
<s> Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
<s> You can do it in my mouth.
<s> Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
<s> Where is home?
<s> Huh?
<s> He looks like a killer.
<s> I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
<s> I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
<s> Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
<s> I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
<s> Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
<s> Yes.
<s> I can't sleep nights.
<s> I know. I tried that.
<s> You moonlightin?
<s> We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
<s> Iris?
<s> Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
<s> It happens.
<s> I know.
<s> Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
<s> Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
<s> You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
<s> I'm a field agent.
<s> You suppose?
<s> Wrong.
<s> I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
<s> It's about time.
<s> Womack ripped it up, right?
<s> Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
<s> Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
<s> And  I love you, Pete!
<s> Delly?  In here.
<s> Well...
<s> You mean,  me?
<s> No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
<s> Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
<s> You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
<s> I'm  fine.  Really.  
<s> Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
<s> Oh...
<s> A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
<s> Oh.
<s> Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
<s> Guess I must've learned.
<s> Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
<s> Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
<s> Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
<s> No, sir.
<s> I'm not refuting anything.
<s> I do.
<s> The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
<s> Mr. Appleton, you will...
<s> Ben, when's Delly due back?
<s> Shhhhhh.
<s> I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
<s> Good to meet you.  Again.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
<s> Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
<s> Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
<s> Dad, I...
<s> ... what?
<s> Anybody take it?
<s> What.
<s> I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
<s> It's possible.  I just don't remember.
<s> Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
<s> Huh?
<s> Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
<s> And I won't be a communist anymore.
<s> Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
<s> What?
<s> We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
<s> Yeah... me too.
<s> What exactly did you hear?
<s> I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
<s> No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
<s> No.  Absolutely not.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
<s> Yes.
<s> No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
<s> I despise it.
<s> Different?
<s> A trifle.
<s> No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
<s> Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
<s> Then go.
<s> In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
<s> I don't think your mother would like that.
<s> She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
<s> It's Alice.
<s> Yep.
<s> Yep.
<s> Right here. Bodega Bay.
<s> Mmmm.
<s> Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
<s> Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
<s> Birds are not bad!
<s> Shall I call the doctor?
<s> We'll make our own fog.
<s> For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
<s> ...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
<s> I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
<s> I'm simply quoting the law.
<s> Mother, where did you go to law school?
<s> I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
<s> I'm sorry, Mitch.
<s> If they are?
<s> No, not exactly.
<s> Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
<s> I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
<s> And if you don't?
<s> Would you like me to go for her?
<s> Did you close the door?
<s> What are we going to do about it, Al?
<s> What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
<s> Monday?
<s> Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
<s> Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
<s> What?
<s> The sign says strawberry finches.
<s> I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
<s> No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
<s> No, San Francisco. What are you...?
<s> I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
<s> Seven o'clock then.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, I was lying.
<s> It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
<s> Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
<s> I don't give a damn what you believe!
<s> What do you want ?
<s> Helping travelers.
<s> What about Thursdays and Fridays?
<s> What?
<s> No, I have my things in the car.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> I'll get it.
<s> After the gulls attacked.
<s> I'm frightened, Mitch.
<s> I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
<s> The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
<s> I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
<s> Mitch...
<s> Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
<s> There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
<s> Maybe! Is it impossible?
<s> With smoke.
<s> Can we go on living here otherwise?
<s> Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
<s> I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
<s> It is a pity.
<s> But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
<s> I've heard of it.
<s> Where can I find him?
<s> At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
<s> Come in, boy -- come in.
<s> Well? And are you not a good student?
<s> From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
<s> Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
<s> Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
<s> This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
<s> I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
<s> Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
<s> I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
<s> They'll be thinking of that, too.
<s> You've no thought of going there?
<s> No.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Why, yes.
<s> I want it --
<s> I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
<s> Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
<s> A doctor?
<s> I am the best man for the job.
<s> I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
<s> The heart pumps it.
<s> I've ordered nothing from you.
<s> We have never been friends.
<s> Would you bribe me to leave you be?
<s> Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
<s> I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
<s> Burke them?
<s> That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
<s> Three years.
<s> But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
<s> But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
<s> You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
<s> I'll get him.
<s> Yeah. I sure will.
<s> I think we should get some support?
<s> I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
<s> A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
<s> Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
<s> There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
<s> They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
<s> Good thing in a situation like this.
<s> What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
<s> I was talking about you.
<s> I know her friends.
<s> I told you, I knew your sister.
<s> When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
<s> Yes I do, I really do.
<s> So you're going to kill him?
<s> It's not. I can't take it.
<s> Not tonight. Honest.
<s> What did I say?
<s> It's not what you think.
<s> Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
<s> Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
<s> It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
<s> That was my first question.
<s> Would you care to be more specific?
<s> My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
<s> Yes.
<s> Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
<s> I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
<s> No -- I'm afraid not.
<s> I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
<s> He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
<s> Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
<s> No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
<s> Why not, Bobby?
<s> Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
<s> He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
<s> I mean the reasons for my coming here.
<s> Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
<s> I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
<s> Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
<s> There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
<s> The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
<s> Come on in.
<s> All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
<s> You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
<s> That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
<s> But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
<s> I feel different right now.
<s> Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
<s> There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
<s> Remember those words.
<s> I -- I thought you were--
<s> You mean he has the power of life and death?
<s> You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
<s> There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
<s> Would you like to sell it?
<s> I'd give you a very good price.
<s> How long will that take?
<s> This one could save your life.
<s> You better get some fresh air.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We don't ride with vampires.
<s> Time to activate Plan B.
<s> Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
<s> Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
<s> Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
<s> You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
<s> For a ride.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I will, David!
<s> Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
<s> Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
<s> His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
<s> Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> I told Max eight o'clock.
<s> You have a T.V.?
<s> This is Michael.
<s> No.  Just you.
<s> Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
<s> I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm tired now.
<s> Michael!...
<s> Smells like something died.
<s> I thought we were poor.
<s> I guess no one cares what I got a job.
<s> We can't talk about it on the phone.
<s> Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
<s> Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
<s> Mom!
<s> I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
<s> Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
<s> I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
<s> No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
<s> Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
<s> Star.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
<s> Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
<s> Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
<s> Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
<s> Piss off.
<s> Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
<s> Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
<s> Huh?...
<s> I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
<s> Dogs don't eat each other.
<s> No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
<s> Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
<s> Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
<s> Have you come across Fuchs?
<s> We'll see...
<s> Ain't it there?
<s> Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
<s> Now hold on, you dumb...
<s> Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
<s> Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
<s> Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
<s> The dogs?
<s> You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
<s> Then I'll have to kill you.
<s> What do you mean "you think so?"
<s> Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
<s> What's that?
<s> Well, stick to it.
<s> Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
<s> Don't let up, Childs!
<s> You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
<s> Damn if I won't.
<s> Blair.  He's gone berserk.
<s> Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
<s> I ain't going with Sanchez.
<s> He's dead.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
<s> Calm down and get in your position.
<s> What?!
<s> I had an accident.
<s> I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
<s> I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
<s> This way.
<s> End...?
<s> What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I will...
<s> You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
<s> As slaves.
<s> Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
<s> No...
<s> I'm a foolish man.
<s> I know.
<s> I just love mechanical things.
<s> Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
<s> I -- what are you?!
<s> Why is it -- breaking up?
<s> Got here as soon as I could.
<s> Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
<s> You know I can't.
<s> Not here... alone.  Please.
<s> You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
<s> Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
<s> I live with it every minute of every day.
<s> Thank you...
<s> Sir...?
<s> Thank you...
<s> Thank you.
<s> I can see Kalen's point.
<s> What's it all for?
<s> Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
<s> Did you have fires at night?
<s> Go back to your own time?
<s> Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
<s> My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
<s> Here?
<s> Tell him to go away --
<s> Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
<s> The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
<s> Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
<s> What are your people called?
<s> No...
<s> Why?
<s> New Yorkers.
<s> We choose to believe it.
<s> We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
<s> That's quite enough, Kalen.
<s> Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
<s> [Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
<s> In where?
<s> Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
<s> They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
<s> You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
<s> Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
<s> He didn't either.
<s> I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
<s> I can't take you out of here in your condition...
<s> His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
<s> Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
<s> Well, you belong in one.
<s> How?
<s> I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
<s> After I...
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> I know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
<s> They're not.
<s> It's Sunday.
<s> No, he didn't.
<s> Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
<s> Then, where are you going?
<s> Ok.
<s> I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
<s> How do you know about Dr. Becker?
<s> [Beat] Yeah, it is.
<s> Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
<s> Well, what time is it?
<s> It doesn't look all that different.
<s> Because I don't have time.
<s> Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
<s> Who told you this?
<s> Don't you go to jail for that?
<s> [Beat] Thanks.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Why "of course"?
<s> The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
<s> [Beat] Why?
<s> Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
<s> May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
<s> I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
<s> Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
<s> Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
<s> If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
<s> It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
<s> How are things goin' out there?
<s> You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
<s> Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
<s> A .38.
<s> Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
<s> Well, you wanna use the shower?
<s> Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
<s> You're a little angle, you are.
<s> Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
<s> Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
<s> Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
<s> Can't it go to any office?
<s> I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
<s> No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
<s> That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
<s> Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
<s> What time are you gonna pick me up?
<s> Okay.  I will, too.
<s> I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
<s> In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
<s> We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
<s> How come he let you go?
<s> Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
<s> Which part?
<s> Yes.
<s> What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
<s> I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
<s> I think better when I drive.
<s> Thelma kinda took to him.
<s> He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
<s> Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
<s> I won't wait up.
<s> You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
<s> Taking a shower.
<s> Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
<s> Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
<s> They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
<s> You mean now or before?
<s> I can see that.
<s> ... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
<s> I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
<s> Just asking.
<s> Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
<s> That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
<s> Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
<s> And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
<s> About two hundred and fifty miles.
<s> What?!
<s> I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
<s> What?!
<s> It's grand!
<s> You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
<s> Grrrreat!
<s> Fresno.
<s> What?
<s> I'll try to be more careful.
<s> So you admit it?
<s> Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
<s> Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
<s> Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
<s> They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
<s> No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
<s> Jesus Christ you're right.
<s> Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
<s> Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
<s> Fucking Sully! Look at you!
<s> Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
<s> Big time.
<s> Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
<s> What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
<s> Am I?
<s> I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
<s> Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
<s> Thanks.
<s> -- He's in a cage?!
<s> Great.
<s> The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
<s> Deco.
<s> -- Love story of our time.
<s> Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
<s> Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
<s> Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
<s> Well, I know you're busy...
<s> No.
<s> I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
<s> So she's married?
<s> Oh my.
<s> Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
<s> Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
<s> Good good.
<s> Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
<s> What?! You're calling me a stalker?
<s> You're a sick man, you know that?
<s> Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
<s> Kim and I are close friends!
<s> Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
<s> Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
<s> How'd you manage that one?
<s> Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
<s> Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
<s> Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
<s> Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
<s> Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
<s> Healy.
<s> Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
<s> I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
<s> Puffy, get over here.
<s> Where's Puffy?
<s> Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
<s> I appreciate you looking out for me.
<s> Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
<s> Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
<s> You mean he's not a criminal?
<s> Thanks a lot, Ted.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Who's that?
<s> Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
<s> Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
<s> I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
<s> Trying to be.
<s> Mary, come on...
<s> Okay.
<s> Really?
<s> Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
<s> You got what stuck?
<s> I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
<s> Giddy-up.
<s> Bye, Ted.
<s> With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
<s> What if I can't?
<s> ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
<s> You can't take him out this late in the game.
<s> Something your father would've come up with.
<s> He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
<s> -- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
<s> McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
<s> Kids are supposed to get detention.
<s> I'll be evacuated with the President.
<s> Forget it, Scotty.
<s> Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
<s> He was.
<s> Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No you weren't.
<s> Not as far as the election goes.
<s> Good.
<s> You're scared to cancel on Daly.
<s> They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
<s> Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
<s> If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
<s> You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
<s> Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
<s> That may be what they want us to think.
<s> Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
<s> We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
<s> Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
<s> Hey. Nice tie.
<s> The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
<s> It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
<s> It ain't Geronimo.
<s> You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
<s> I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
<s> Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
<s> She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
<s> A long way from home. You be careful out there.
<s> You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
<s> After we've completed our investigation.
<s> Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
<s> Let's go.
<s> Medicine. As in medicine man?
<s> He knows me?
<s> They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
<s> At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
<s> Yeah. Fitful dreams.
<s> Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
<s> What?
<s> He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
<s> That's right. Turn around.
<s> You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
<s> You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
<s> Mister Tully.
<s> No. No, no. Thank you.
<s> They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
<s> How the hell do you know?
<s> Well, it is. It is that, too.
<s> Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
<s> I saw one.
<s> You let me make a fool of myself.
<s> For what?
<s> Evan... or Maverick.
<s> You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
<s> How about anything, anything you want to do.
<s> About as much as they think about killing me.
<s> They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
<s> Where?
<s> Anything.
<s> Why?
<s> What?
<s> Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
<s> What?
<s> That's what I want.
<s> It does.
<s> I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
<s> I hope you find him.
<s> Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
<s> F-14's sir.
<s> Remember one thing.
<s> YEAH, COUGAR?
<s> What is?
<s> Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
<s> What are you talking about, we gotta go!
<s> Well what?
<s> You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
<s> Like what?
<s> Got you here.
<s> So's my Johnson.
<s> Who's your pilot?
<s> No shit. The Iceman....
<s> Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
<s> I've had enough...for now.
<s> Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
<s> Let's go. Eject.
<s> No shit! That why they call him Ice?
<s> Come on. I died enough for one night.
<s> Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
<s> What now?
<s> GOT 'EM.
<s> SHIT!!
<s> You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
<s> Just below ten thousand.
<s> Tell me one thing.
<s> Didn't everybody?
<s> Me?
<s> Sir?
<s> ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
<s> Or....
<s> But maybe you can change all that.
<s> Hey, I got four kids to feed.
<s> Who are you?
<s> I am Quaid.
<s> That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
<s> No, sir.
<s> They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
<s> Why not?
<s> This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
<s> I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
<s> She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
<s> That's right.
<s> Any news of Quaid?
<s> You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
<s> "RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
<s> Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
<s> You went to Rekall, remember?
<s> Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
<s> Let me buy you a drink.
<s> I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
<s> Split up.  Find him.
<s> Nobody.
<s> Lori, move.
<s> I'm late.
<s> Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
<s> What did they do to you?  Tell me!
<s> Doug...
<s> I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
<s> I didn't know you were so kinky.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> How real does it seem?
<s> I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
<s> I guess he didn't.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Not any more.
<s> No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
<s> He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
<s> The one in the mine!
<s> It's just up ahead.
<s> Enough for everybody to breathe?
<s> Some kind of mutation...?
<s> One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
<s> Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
<s> You can't fight'em that way...
<s> Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
<s> In a minute.
<s> Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
<s> Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
<s> Well, who put you two in charge?
<s> Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
<s> I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
<s> VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
<s> No.  We go straight.
<s> Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
<s> Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
<s> Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
<s> Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
<s> Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
<s> Me, too.
<s> I'm gonna help you.
<s> Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
<s> We got a plan!
<s> Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
<s> I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
<s> Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
<s> Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
<s> If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
<s> Ran into the new college student, Rona.
<s> Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
<s> God, what a stink!
<s> You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
<s> You guys do all the odd jobs.
<s> Sustained.
<s> I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
<s> Can't I take a simple piss without --
<s> So go take your job on Wall Street.
<s> -- The Nazi he knifed?
<s> -- Remember?
<s> George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
<s> A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
<s> What's Art Esparza?
<s> Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
<s> ... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
<s> Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
<s> Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
<s> EXACTLY!
<s> Want to tell me what went down here?
<s> Maybe... because someone's afraid.
<s> About Chinatown. What went down.
<s> This and that.
<s> It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
<s> That's right.
<s> Calls for speculation.
<s> We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
<s> I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
<s> Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
<s> -- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
<s> I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
<s> Shouldn't one of us...?
<s> -- Roger --
<s> Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
<s> Soldado.
<s> I want you.
<s> Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
<s> Here he comes.
<s> Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
<s> We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
<s> An old woman and her grandson.
<s> Yep, it sure is.
<s> That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
<s> That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
<s> You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
<s> Smell something fishy, huh?
<s> YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
<s> No, sir, we did not.
<s> Sorry to hear it.
<s> I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
<s> Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
<s> Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
<s> Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
<s> I'll get my kit.
<s> Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
<s> You didn't do your homework?
<s> When?
<s> Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
<s> No, I want to smoke.
<s> If I can smoke it.
<s> No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
<s> YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
<s> All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
<s> Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
<s> Who would do that?
<s> But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
<s> I already made you two tapes.
<s> I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
<s> Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
<s> Let's go all the way.
<s> Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
<s> James...
<s> Not now.
<s> Everything, but everything.
<s> What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
<s> Eating?
<s> Sex?
<s> I understand.
<s> What?
<s> Sure you do, it's good for you.
<s> It's a school night... back by nine.
<s> Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
<s> Dad...
<s> Stay away from me.
<s> Oh, Leland.
<s> How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
<s> I'm kind of busy, Norma.
<s> There's no one here.
<s> Abrams...
<s> I'm fine.
<s> As far as we know, nothing.
<s> You thought it was just.
<s> Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
<s> ...yes. Get her on the phone...
<s> Gruber...
<s> What does it mean?
<s> No.
<s> I...
<s> You've just said you signed it.
<s> I thought I would need it.
<s> That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
<s> I'm just an M.D.
<s> I know of him.
<s> Meth... Methodology and Technique...
<s> I'm on the staff of...
<s> Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
<s> Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
<s> Objection.
<s> Frank Galvin. We've met before.
<s> Huh!
<s> I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
<s> ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
<s> Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
<s> Yes.
<s> What did these people do when her heart stopped?
<s> 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
<s> I completely understand...
<s> You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
<s> You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
<s> I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
<s> There's nothing they can do to me.
<s> In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
<s> No, you did fine.
<s> No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
<s> What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
<s> Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
<s> Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
<s> She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
<s> To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
<s> You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
<s> These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
<s> She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
<s> ...things change.
<s> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
<s> Thank you for seeing me.
<s> I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
<s> Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
<s> I changed my room at the Hotel.
<s> And what are you? A cop?
<s> I think I will.
<s> They, uh, they got to my witness.
<s> Isn't there something you...
<s> Yes.
<s> I... do you want me to leave?
<s> What is that to you...?
<s> No... no...
<s> No.
<s> ...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
<s> We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
<s> I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
<s> And ask me what?
<s> I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
<s> Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
<s> A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
<s> ...I understand...
<s> Dr. Gruber's not in.
<s> Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
<s> One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
<s> What do you want?
<s> ...I'm going to need your help...
<s> ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
<s> I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
<s> Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think we tried that. The case is over.
<s> The 'History'...?
<s> We got to talk.
<s> Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
<s> I don't want a mistrial.
<s> Yes, that's correct.
<s> ...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
<s> Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
<s> How'm I doing so far?
<s> That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
<s> We'd be in all the papers!
<s> Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
<s> We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
<s> Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
<s> Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
<s> Would you like some coffee, General?
<s> No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
<s> Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
<s> Don't you live at home?
<s> I liked him.
<s> I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
<s> It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
<s> You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
<s> I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
<s> If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
<s> I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
<s> It's always been a good persuader.
<s> From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
<s> We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
<s> Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
<s> He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
<s> Come on.  Kids love horror.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
<s> Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
<s> Chase, you'd better come home.
<s> No...
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
<s> They were safe and could sleep.
<s> You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
<s> A story?
<s> Read me some?
<s> Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
<s> It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
<s> Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
<s> Yes?
<s> No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
<s> What's that?
<s> I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
<s> By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
<s> But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
<s> Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
<s> Coffee'd be nice.
<s> It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
<s> I can take it.
<s> I haven't forgotten.
<s> Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
<s> Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
<s> My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
<s> No, I can't.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> I know.
<s> Figured what out?
<s> You don't give him enough credit Chas.
<s> Shut up, Phil.
<s> I guess.
<s> I gotta go.
<s> Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
<s> That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
<s> Do what?
<s> My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
<s> How do you know?  They might.
<s> My dad.
<s> Jesus, you never told them?
<s> Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
<s> You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
<s> I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
<s> He killed the dolphin.
<s> Of what?
<s> They have every right Chuck.
<s> I don't know.
<s> So is violating international law.
<s> I know.
<s> This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
<s> He's a big boy.
<s> I should be eating with the crew.
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
<s> They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
<s> She's Cuban.
<s> On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
<s> Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
<s> I don't have to listen to this.
<s> You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
<s> He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
<s> No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
<s> About anything.
<s> Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
<s> I'm not staying out here.
<s> I can't.
<s> What makes you so sure it was one?
<s> You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
<s> Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
<s> Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
<s> Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
<s> The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
<s> Yessir.
<s> We don't have no paper bags.
<s> Get out.
<s> No, haven't heard of it.
<s> You an indian?
<s> Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
<s> Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
<s> When did you talk to Lula?
<s> Have now.
<s> Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
<s> Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
<s> Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
<s> Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
<s> Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
<s> I couldn't say, which one?
<s> The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
<s> Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
<s> Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
<s> Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
<s> Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
<s> This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
<s> No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
<s> Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
<s> All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
<s> What I made you do, mama?
<s> Why, honey?
<s> Peanut...
<s> 'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
<s> I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
<s> Didn't he say somethin'?
<s> No, he picked me up.
<s> 'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
<s> One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
<s> That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
<s> Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
<s> At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
<s> You tell the boy who knocked you up?
<s> What's that?
<s> We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
<s> Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
<s> What'd you say to her?
<s> You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
<s> It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
<s> Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
<s> What kinda trash talk is that?
<s> That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
<s> Got anyplace special in mind?
<s> Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
<s> You do.
<s> Where?
<s> Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
<s> Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
<s> Under a hundred.
<s> That'd be good, Lula.
<s> This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
<s> I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
<s> I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
<s> Fan works.
<s> I'll come along.
<s> What could I be up to, Lula?
<s> It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
<s> Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
<s> Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
<s> What time's Sailor's train get in?
<s> Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
<s> Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
<s> I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
<s> Yes.
<s> What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
<s> Yes... Get rid of him.
<s> I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
<s> All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
<s> Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
<s> No... But...
<s> You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
<s> Someone's gonna see us.
<s> So?
<s> Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
<s> I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
<s> Life is unpredictable.
<s> I didn't see nothin'...
<s> That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
<s> Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
<s> The candelabras were my Gran's.
<s> Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
<s> How are you, Crabtree?
<s> I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
<s> Perfect. Well then, shall we?
<s> She's still a transvestite.
<s> Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
<s> This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
<s> Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
<s> And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
<s> Hit your brakes.
<s> Just go around him.
<s> Where would we go?
<s> What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
<s> It's a little late to call Admissions.
<s> Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
<s> Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
<s> So what's the problem?
<s> No wonder he screwed us over.
<s> That was MacCaulay.
<s> Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
<s> I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
<s> So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
<s> That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
<s> Her dog, yes.
<s> So is my friend... is Sara still here?
<s> No sweat. Only do me a favor?
<s> Stop calling me Vernon.
<s> Just what? Doing a little dusting?
<s> ...You carry firearms.
<s> She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
<s> You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
<s> I'll miss my bus.
<s> So I'm told.
<s> Yea, James.
<s> She is. Ah. Here we go...
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Who?
<s> Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
<s> Blocked.
<s> Well done, James.
<s> So where have you been staying?
<s> Your aunt?
<s> Maybe...
<s> Where's that?
<s> I never heard of it.
<s> What kind of dancer?
<s> James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
<s> Amazing.
<s> She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
<s> You're mad at me, aren't you?
<s> Jealous? Of me?
<s> I didn't mean it that way.
<s> Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
<s> Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
<s> James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
<s> James, like it or not, they're your parents.
<s> Yes, James.
<s> Just checking.
<s> Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
<s> James'll know about George Sanders.
<s> Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
<s> Walter just got it back from the framer today.
<s> All right. This morning --
<s> No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
<s> Really? That was fast.
<s> Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
<s> It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
<s> Grady.
<s> I think I might've said I was in love with you.
<s> He told me.
<s> Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
<s> And you're old.
<s> I'm your man.
<s> Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
<s> That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
<s> Jesus. Is that what he told you?
<s> Yes?
<s> Sick.
<s> Taking the long way home.
<s> I was thinking of you.
<s> Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
<s> A jockey? You mean, like --
<s> Just kidding.
<s> K through sixth.
<s> I like the noise.
<s> How is she?
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
<s> Sure.
<s> Their sound is quite musical.
<s> It's a bright sound.
<s> That was terrific.
<s> I have friends.
<s> I'm not pretty.
<s> Robin.
<s> I could get a search warrant.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Little Red Riding Hood.
<s> I count my blessings.
<s> I'm adjusting okay.
<s> Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
<s> How come?
<s> It sounds like you were banished.
<s> Yes?
<s> I know because... it's just something I know.
<s> Robin, listen to me.
<s> Yes?
<s> The job's okay.
<s> I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
<s> That was a joke.
<s> A diary?
<s> No way.
<s> No fucking way.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Have to talk about something.
<s> I'm not that crazy.
<s> If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
<s> I couldn't say.
<s> What is your idea of being normal?
<s> Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
<s> I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
<s> I want you to calm down.
<s> I want to talk about it now.
<s> Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't see --
<s> Not so fast.
<s> Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
<s> Did you and your sister often take naps together?
<s> All right.
<s> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
<s> Yes.
<s> I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
<s> Neither do you.
<s> K through sixth.
<s> Yeah, they could.
<s> It's been a while since...
<s> What did you do to them?
<s> Hey, I'm not --
<s> Why young girls, Walter?
<s> Nothing. It's over.
<s> Which brother did this?
<s> No you don't.
<s> What's your fucking problem?
<s> There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
<s> No way that could just be seawater.
<s> What is that?  You drop your dive light?
<s> Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
<s> I'm switching off now.
<s> Not for long.
<s> Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
<s> That must be it.
<s> I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
<s> I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
<s> Cute, Virgil.
<s> Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
<s> Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
<s> How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
<s> Chill out, Lindsey!!
<s> Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
<s> Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
<s> They'll come out after us.
<s> WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
<s> Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
<s> Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
<s> Why bring it here?
<s> I can't... make it... podner.
<s> You watch yourself.
<s> Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
<s> We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
<s> Neutron counter's not showing very much.
<s> Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
<s> What's you depth, Cab Three?
<s> Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
<s> Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
<s> I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
<s> It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
<s> Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
<s> You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
<s> But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
<s> It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
<s> That must be Basiluzzo.
<s> Well, what?
<s> Maybe you'd better ask him.
<s> How should I be ... arrogant?
<s> And why haven't they left each other?
<s> Occasionally, but always with affection.
<s> Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
<s> Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
<s> Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
<s> What! Get married?
<s> And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
<s> I deserve it.
<s> Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
<s> But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
<s> No.
<s> What do you think?
<s> We'll try again.
<s> I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
<s> What is it?
<s> And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
<s> Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
<s> But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
<s> No, not like this one.
<s> Because this is a Chinese radio.
<s> Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
<s> There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
<s> Yes, we will.
<s> They didn't seem too good.
<s> Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
<s> If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
<s> Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
<s> Yes. Until proven otherwise.
<s> Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
<s> Who?
<s> Agnes...
<s> Oh my dear child.
<s> Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
<s> My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
<s> Yes, of God.
<s> Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
<s> Anything... may I sit down?
<s> Everyone.
<s> Right now?
<s> In the confessional.
<s> Did it hurt?
<s> And what did you do?
<s> In the middle of all the pain?
<s> Where'd it come from before that?
<s> After God... before the waste-paper basket.
<s> No.
<s> Not at the moment, no.
<s> Does it bother you?
<s> What?
<s> No... do you?
<s> Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
<s> No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
<s> She'd get angry.
<s> A mistake... it was a mistake...
<s> If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
<s> ... makes me...
<s> And then...
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> No I'm not.
<s> But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
<s> Yes.
<s> Because I was afraid.
<s> I ate.
<s> Do you know who put it there?
<s> Go away, I don't want you here.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why?
<s> Who?
<s> Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
<s> Agnes, who did this to you?
<s> She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
<s> I put her to sleep.
<s> I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
<s> If I find anything I'll call you.
<s> Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
<s> Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
<s> The one up on the third floor?
<s> Unfiltered.
<s> She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
<s> If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
<s> That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
<s> It's possible isn't it?
<s> One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
<s> And you weren't shocked?
<s> I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
<s> Nothing.
<s> What is it?
<s> I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
<s> She drank too much. That's what killed her.
<s> I don't think I care to know.
<s> I'd like yours too.
<s> She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
<s> You just said...
<s> So you left the Church because you had freckles?
<s> Right...
<s> Oh, you've come a long way baby.
<s> Listen to her singing.
<s> Would it stop you if I did?
<s> For the Church?
<s> You think she's a saint?
<s> She is an innocent.
<s> I'm concerned about her health.
<s> I have a few more questions to ask her.
<s> Is it because she's a nun?
<s> Yes.
<s> The scandal...
<s> She didn't want any help.
<s> I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
<s> Shurrup!
<s> How about Ding Dong?
<s> Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
<s> They'll be here.
<s> Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
<s> Yeah, grotesque.
<s> I don't care.
<s> Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
<s> No, straight up.
<s> Now what's that supposed to mean?
<s> Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
<s> He comes from a large family.
<s> Follow your impulse.
<s> I'll look in here again.
<s> Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
<s> Eh, there's only three of them.
<s> Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
<s> Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
<s> I'm not ...
<s> Yes.
<s> And cunning.
<s> Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
<s> Well ... what's the matter with that?
<s> Books are good!
<s> Oh ... I dunno.
<s> Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
<s> Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
<s> Have they?
<s> Me!
<s> Eh?
<s> Every morning.
<s> You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
<s> And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
<s> Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
<s> Here, Pauly.
<s> For Ringo.
<s> Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
<s> Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
<s> He started it.
<s> Ah, go on, you swine.
<s> Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
<s> Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
<s> Oink! Oink!
<s> I'm not, no.
<s> Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
<s> I would have said so.
<s> No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
<s> What have you heard?
<s> Aah, shurrup, misery!
<s> Don't start. Look.
<s> Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
<s> Well, give a couple of minutes ...
<s> Nerves.
<s> Clever.  George.
<s> Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
<s> Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
<s> Dell, plot our location.
<s> Where the hell are we?
<s> Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
<s> Then take her down.
<s> Receiving.
<s> Take care.
<s> God I'm hungry.
<s> I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
<s> <u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
<s> A voice transmission.
<s> It grows on you.
<s> Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
<s> Shit...
<s> It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
<s> Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
<s> -- And the cooling unit on the other.
<s> Damn it!  How long to fix?
<s> Here, let me try.
<s> Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
<s> It wouldn't come.
<s> Careful, don't get under it!
<s> How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
<s> Still unconscious?
<s> Sounds like a rough one.
<s> At least it can't get up here now.
<s> We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
<s> Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
<s> What is it -- I can't tell anything --
<s> I think it's fizzled out.
<s> I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
<s> Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
<s> How far?
<s> Can you see anything?
<s> What is it?
<s> We're going into the freezers now.
<s> Are they close?
<s> Right.  Fire up all systems.
<s> Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
<s> Oh well... you know me.
<s> Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
<s> Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
<s> Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
<s> He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
<s> Quit complaining; we're in space.
<s> I guess we open the door and net it.
<s> Here, carry these.
<s> Kablooey.
<s> Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
<s> Has anybody talked to them?
<s> What?
<s> Anything you say, Mammacitta.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Just behind us, over to the right.
<s> Yeah, I...
<s> Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
<s> Sounds great.
<s> Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
<s> Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
<s> Not too much of the socializing type, then?
<s> Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
<s> Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
<s> I... I can't!
<s> I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
<s> Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
<s> I'm not enough for a paragraph.
<s> Yes. I do.
<s> Yes. The Shubert.
<s> Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
<s> I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
<s> Paved with what, then?
<s> Why'd call me a killer?
<s> It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
<s> A dull cliche.
<s> She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
<s> Yes, Addison.
<s> Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
<s> That's how you met me. In passing.
<s> Margo.
<s> I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
<s> Frankly, I don't remember.
<s> The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
<s> I'm a junk yard.
<s> Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
<s> All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
<s> Huh?
<s> As of this moment you're six years old...
<s> I love you...
<s> What?
<s> It won't play.
<s> You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
<s> She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
<s> So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
<s> For instance - you!
<s> You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
<s> What's all over?
<s> You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
<s> I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
<s> Margo, let's make peace.
<s> But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
<s> Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
<s> I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
<s> What would you like? Texas?
<s> I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
<s> Why you have to go out there.
<s> It's only one picture deal.
<s> I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
<s> It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
<s> Are you proud of me, Bill?
<s> When I told you what every young actress should know.
<s> Oh, brother.
<s> Night an' day.
<s> Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
<s> Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
<s> I - I guess I fell asleep.
<s> Probably not.
<s> I might.
<s> He's the best.
<s> Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
<s> Eve. Eve Harrington.
<s> My husband...
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
<s> The show must go on.
<s> But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
<s> If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
<s> They certainly don't waste much time.
<s> There can't be very much-
<s> - an understudy's performance.
<s> I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
<s> I'll never get over it.
<s> If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
<s> How do you do, Mr. Richards.
<s> Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
<s> Not at all...
<s> I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
<s> There are other plays...
<s> Well - if I'm not in the way...
<s> They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
<s> Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
<s> I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
<s> It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
<s> Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
<s> Roughly ten minutes.
<s> It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
<s> Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
<s> We've all seemed a little tense lately...
<s> You're Margo. Just - Margo.
<s> What about Bill?
<s> And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
<s> Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
<s> Where'd you get all that information?
<s> Eve?
<s> I wonder why.
<s> Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
<s> Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
<s> They'd die without each other.
<s> What is he talking about?
<s> Margo, you haven't got any age.
<s> Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
<s> It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
<s> She was a revelation...
<s> That's beside the point.
<s> Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
<s> Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
<s> City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
<s> Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
<s> It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
<s> I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
<s> Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
<s> A couple of weeks.
<s> This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
<s> Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
<s> --I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
<s> Yeah?
<s> Let me lay a little theory on you--
<s> What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
<s> Hmm.
<s> --a spy, you mean?
<s> --you do?--with access to records?
<s> You're not a kid anymore.
<s> It's safe, try it, you'll see.
<s> --you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
<s> And I'm a Republican.
<s> You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
<s> --Colson.
<s> --the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
<s> --I know, I know--
<s> Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
<s> --'cause I only know four chords--
<s> You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
<s> --Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
<s> Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
<s> 11:30.
<s> Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
<s> --so?
<s> --yes--
<s> If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
<s> --what?--
<s> We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
<s> ...No... never in so many words...
<s> Which people?
<s> Who were they?
<s> --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
<s> My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
<s> A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
<s> Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
<s> I will not talk about the other two.
<s> --this'll only take one second--
<s> I'm not your source on that.
<s> --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
<s> My non-denial denial.
<s> Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
<s> Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
<s> Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
<s> Where?  What do you mean, where?
<s> ...check...?
<s> Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
<s> John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
<s> I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
<s> The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
<s> Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
<s> Mitchell knew then.
<s> I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
<s> You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
<s> Good God!
<s> --I'm Woodward.
<s> I think so.
<s> Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
<s> --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
<s> --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
<s> --well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
<s> I did all right on McCord.
<s> Lotsa hints--
<s> --well, Sloan--
<s> Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
<s> --remember Toronto, Harry.
<s> I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> --can we use their names?--
<s> Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
<s> I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
<s> My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
<s> As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
<s> One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
<s> Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
<s> I'm not Miss Abbott.
<s> ...okay...
<s> Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
<s> I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
<s> Pardon me?
<s> First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
<s> Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
<s> Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
<s> Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
<s> You can call me Oz.
<s> How did you know I was here?
<s> Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
<s> You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
<s> No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
<s> Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
<s> Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
<s> Sure.
<s> Finch, you got the Latin homework?
<s> But --
<s> Pontificated.
<s> Went home to shit.
<s> She's already on a plane back home.
<s> Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
<s> Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
<s> A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
<s> Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
<s> You've got something going?
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
<s> Uh...yeah...sorry.
<s> Nadia, I can't --
<s> This just got a hell of a lot better.
<s> Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
<s> Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
<s> Okay, don't stop.
<s> How?
<s> Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
<s> Yeah, right here.
<s> Yeah, the time went by so fast.
<s> What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
<s> Qualify for what?
<s> Oh shit dude, the L-word!
<s> She works part-time at my dad's store.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Uhh! Would you die already!
<s> Also like sex with my wife.
<s> Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
<s> No it isn't! You're dead!
<s> You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
<s> You must get out of here. It's not safe.
<s> It's okay. I can see fine.
<s> Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Where did you go last night? What did you do?
<s> I know. He told me.
<s> A cure?
<s> Yeah. French fries...
<s> No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
<s> Where?
<s> Really.
<s> After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
<s> Well, they are French.
<s> Andy...
<s> "Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
<s> Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
<s> My uncle's in a coma you moron!
<s> He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
<s> Or else what? You'll kill me?
<s> You'll never get the chance.
<s> If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
<s> You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
<s> Andy? Andy is that you?
<s> Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
<s> Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
<s> How well did, er, do you know him?
<s> Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
<s> No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
<s> Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
<s> I told you. These murders are not normal.
<s> Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
<s> Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
<s> But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
<s> When you're older . . .
<s> Get on! Anastasia, get on!
<s> Then come find me.
<s> I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
<s> I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
<s> Yes, your highness.
<s> Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
<s> What happened to your parents?
<s> Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
<s> I was all out of dynamite!
<s> That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
<s> Trying... to... breathe...
<s> Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
<s> It's okay. Didn't hurt..
<s> Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
<s> I'm glad you	did too.
<s> I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
<s> THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
<s> Is it? Is this what you want?
<s> Yes, you do. You do.
<s> I cursed then all!
<s> Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
<s> That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
<s> It worked in Odessa...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
<s> Run, Anya -  go...
<s> How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
<s> You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
<s> What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
<s> No. Empress, you --
<s> Young	man, I...
<s> This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
<s> This guy's on television.
<s> Why not?
<s> Alvy.
<s> I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
<s> Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
<s> I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
<s> Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
<s> That movie makes me feel guilty.
<s> Oooh! Here! Here!
<s> Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
<s> Hey, that was last year.
<s> Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
<s> You-you play... very well.
<s> Me? Oh, downtown!
<s> Oh, I'm in her acting class.
<s> No, Chippewa Falls.
<s> Okay, that's good.
<s> M'hm...
<s> Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
<s> Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
<s> Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
<s> You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
<s> Oh, all right.
<s> Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
<s> Oh.
<s> As Balzac said...
<s> "There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
<s> No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
<s> H'm?
<s> U-huh.
<s> Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
<s> Do I love you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
<s> Mine.
<s> I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
<s> Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
<s> I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
<s> Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
<s> Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
<s> Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
<s> Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
<s> Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
<s> Who cares? Who cares?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
<s> Whatta you mean? Me?
<s> Will it change your wife?
<s> You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
<s> And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
<s> And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
<s> My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
<s> I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
<s> I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
<s> Oh. What?
<s> Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
<s> Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
<s> Oh, I had the radio on.
<s> It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
<s> Holy cow!
<s> Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
<s> Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
<s> Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
<s> No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
<s> I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh-
<s> Remember that day?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, Alvy, come on.
<s> No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
<s> I'm late.
<s> I thought just earplugs.
<s> Commentary.
<s> Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
<s> What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
<s> Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
<s> I can't.
<s> You catch Dylan?
<s> It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
<s> He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
<s> I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
<s> I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
<s> Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
<s> Whatta you mean?
<s> May I see your license, please?
<s> Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
<s> But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
<s> Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
<s> What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
<s> While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
<s> I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
<s> Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
<s> Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
<s> And... uh-
<s> Who's persecuting? She stole!
<s> I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
<s> If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
<s> We really had a good time.
<s> Oh, you remember her, Annie.
<s> Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
<s> Oh.
<s> I was a great beauty.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> I'm not that good.
<s> Why last?
<s> Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
<s> Leo?
<s> Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
<s> Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
<s> It's alright, isn't it?
<s> I'm in mourning.
<s> Didn't I say?
<s> They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
<s> Don't you miss it?
<s> Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
<s> Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
<s> Oh my God, the sitter.
<s> Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
<s> I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
<s> Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
<s> I love you, Joe Therrian.
<s> Let's go upstairs, okay?
<s> Lucy overdosed.
<s> Monica.
<s> We live next door.
<s> You're crazy baby.  I love you.
<s> Anytime, sport.
<s> Probably not.
<s> We've only been over this how many times?
<s> Ryan's novel.
<s> No.  I missed that.
<s> No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
<s> Who'd like to go and find Otis?
<s> It's taken care of.
<s> Truce?
<s> He'll find his way back.
<s> Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
<s> Otis!
<s> Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
<s> Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
<s> This is insanity.  Sally...
<s> What?!  You aborted our child?!
<s> I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
<s> I'll be with you.
<s> You don't have to.
<s> Me too.
<s> He's my favorite.
<s> She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
<s> Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
<s> But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
<s> I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
<s> Don't be silly.
<s> Oh.
<s> Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
<s> Lemon.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> How long have you been married?
<s> Come here.
<s> Time!
<s> Not good.
<s> I'm sure you understand.
<s> He always has two or three going...
<s> You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
<s> You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
<s> Don't go in, Ryan.
<s> There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
<s> How long ago was it?
<s> Not at all.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Really??
<s> Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
<s> Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
<s> She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
<s> You see, that's worse.
<s> Like your business managers?
<s> I didn't hear me say tonight.
<s> I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
<s> No, really, five thousand with your discount.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
<s> At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
<s> And here they are!
<s> Hm.
<s> Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
<s> And Cal's this massive adult?
<s> Why are you doing this?
<s> Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
<s> It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
<s> <u>What</u>?
<s> Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
<s> Wait!  When can I see you again?
<s> Quiet -- sshhh!!
<s> Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
<s> Hlllllllp!
<s> Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
<s> Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
<s> Yes?
<s> Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
<s> There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
<s> And do Princesses do improper things?
<s> Don't get all sappy about it!
<s> Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
<s> Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
<s> Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
<s> Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
<s> Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
<s> We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
<s> Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
<s> And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
<s> What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
<s> What do I do?
<s> You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
<s> I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
<s> Under the mat? 
<s> Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
<s> Good night.
<s> It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
<s> Eight-thirty!
<s> I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
<s> Cheers.
<s> Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
<s> Of course not.
<s> This is a bad day for me.
<s> After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
<s> My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
<s> I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
<s> In his apartment.
<s> That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
<s> A bad insurance risk?
<s> So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
<s> Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
<s> Was he really upset when you told him?
<s> Pick up your cards and let's go.
<s> You bet. I got a terrific hand.
<s> So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
<s> Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
<s> I don't want to talk to him.
<s> Sure.  What's that funny smell?
<s> Oh.
<s> I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
<s> It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
<s> Over a girl?
<s> In the knee?
<s> Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
<s> You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
<s> It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
<s> The dishes?
<s> What?
<s> Fine. How's your eye?
<s> Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
<s> No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
<s> Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Are you going to deny it?
<s> Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
<s> West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
<s> That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
<s> Relax, Baxter.
<s> Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
<s> You too, sir.
<s> No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
<s> I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
<s> Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
<s> Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
<s> Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
<s> What do you mean, sorry?
<s> I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
<s> Yes?
<s> Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
<s> All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
<s> I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
<s> Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
<s> Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
<s> Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
<s> No!
<s> Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
<s> You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
<s> Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
<s> Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
<s> My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
<s> Let me get my bag.
<s> I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
<s> Well, I have things to do --
<s> Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
<s> Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
<s> Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
<s> Good night.
<s> Who?
<s> Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
<s> Get more coffee.
<s> I took sleeping pills.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
<s> I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
<s> Six weeks. But who's counting?
<s> Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
<s> I wasn't trying.
<s> Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
<s> You mean you bring other girls up here?
<s> Go where?
<s> Captain Willard -- go ahead.
<s> I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
<s> I said I like all of them.
<s> Esprit de corps --
<s> No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
<s> I know.
<s> Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
<s> Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
<s> Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Where ?
<s> First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
<s> We're Americans.
<s> Looks pretty shallow.
<s> Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
<s> Would he remember you ?
<s> Ours.
<s> You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
<s> Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
<s> What is it?
<s> What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
<s> They must have seen the fire.
<s> This gentleman or myself ?
<s> I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
<s> He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
<s> About what ?
<s> Do you know that jungle?
<s> We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> What?
<s> Boss left.
<s> It's still pretty hairy, sir.
<s> Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
<s> He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
<s> You can't have water after morphine.
<s> What Truth?
<s> Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
<s> He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
<s> You knew him best.
<s> We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
<s> Why did they attack us?
<s> Why didn't he shoot you?
<s> Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
<s> No. Not really.
<s> You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
<s> Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
<s> 23   CONTINUED:  
<s> Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
<s> 107  CONTINUED:
<s> 134  CONTINUED:  
<s> I just want this over with.
<s> I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
<s> I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
<s> Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
<s> I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
<s> That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
<s> -- Corbett's a killer.
<s> Why?
<s> Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
<s> Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
<s> Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
<s> A daughter in Oregon.
<s> -- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
<s> I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
<s> I'm here to do my job.
<s> Where's my ELT?
<s> An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
<s> You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
<s> You don't know how true that is.
<s> You broke the radio, remember?
<s> Shut up!
<s> Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
<s> Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
<s> You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
<s> Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
<s> Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
<s> What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
<s> Musta never got a chance to -more-
<s> I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
<s> Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
<s> No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
<s> You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
<s> What's wrong with your son, anyway?
<s> How old are you?
<s> What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
<s> No!!! Stay away from me!
<s> I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
<s> He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
<s> Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
<s> Hey, what I did for you is working out?
<s> I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
<s> You take off when you have to.
<s> Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
<s> Welcome.
<s> Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
<s> Never.
<s> That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
<s> What do you mean? You said you liked it.
<s> I'll take a bus.
<s> I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
<s> Okay. Good-bye.
<s> ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
<s> Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
<s> You know what? I...
<s> I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
<s> Yes. I really would.
<s> No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
<s> No. No. Get Carol.
<s> What are you trying to do to me?
<s> I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
<s> Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
<s> What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
<s> Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
<s> It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
<s> Do it.
<s> Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
<s> Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
<s> Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
<s> If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
<s> Wait here.
<s> Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
<s> See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
<s> Well, I can't reach them.
<s> No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
<s> You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
<s> 'Love was... '
<s> Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
<s> Okay, then.
<s> It smells like shit in here?
<s> Where are all your queer party friends?
<s> Got any easier questions?
<s> Another place where?
<s> Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
<s> No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
<s> You're right.  Talking too much again.
<s> After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
<s> I ain't scared of you.
<s> That's right.
<s> Bain!
<s> What?
<s> Sick.  The flu.
<s> I'm worried about you, Robert.
<s> Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
<s> Where are we going?
<s> Until a minute ago.
<s> No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
<s> Right.
<s> If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
<s> He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
<s> Why?
<s> He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
<s> Why not?
<s> Then you went freelance?
<s> Yes.
<s> Because I want to know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
<s> You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
<s> Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
<s> Okay.  Then what?
<s> Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
<s> Yes.
<s> He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
<s> What?
<s> Why?
<s> I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
<s> It can be.
<s> I'm not sure that I care anymore.
<s> Right.
<s> I called because I just want... I need to talk.
<s> Everyone regrets something.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
<s> All the time.
<s> I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
<s> That's correct.
<s> American currency.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
<s> We're only joking.....It is your round though!
<s> No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
<s> Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
<s> It's big, right Jahn?
<s> Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
<s> You're nuts man, Katka's right!
<s> No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
<s> 'cause you stink of booze.
<s> Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
<s> But how did the wall get here?
<s> They'll never get us.
<s> Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
<s> You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
<s> No beer?
<s> Forget it Doug, it's no good.
<s> It just happened.
<s> She's cool.
<s> I could try and get a Western lawyer.
<s> Did you see anything in the files?
<s> What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
<s> Some deal you did there!
<s> We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
<s> What?
<s> No, by road?
<s> Yes.
<s> Ooh, well excuse me.
<s> I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
<s> Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
<s> It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
<s> No.
<s> Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
<s> Thanks.
<s> There's nothing there for me.
<s> And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
<s> Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
<s> Great....How long will it go for?
<s> Yo, dobree!
<s> Good, great....Dobchay!
<s> I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
<s> What for?
<s> No, it should be over soon.
<s> Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
<s> No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
<s> I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
<s> Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
<s> Yeah seems okay.
<s> Guests.
<s> Uh-huh!
<s> Yeah, but it was okay.
<s> Fuck you!
<s> It was the biggest I could find.
<s> I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
<s> Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
<s> I insist, it is the least we can do.
<s> You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
<s> Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
<s> The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
<s> Some Americans?
<s> All the more reason to eliminate him.
<s> Heart be still.
<s> We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I could take after Dad, too.
<s> I meant he's a doctor.
<s> Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
<s> Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
<s> No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
<s> Demented.
<s> It was.
<s> What kind of a man are you, son?
<s> -- Obviously.
<s> I don't want to have any conversation.
<s> -- This play means a lot to me.
<s> He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
<s> Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
<s> I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
<s> The dirty snowball at its core.
<s> My relationship with God is my own.
<s> You don't miss a thing.
<s> Belinda's a very jealous person.
<s> You don't know what you want --
<s> Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
<s> We're doing something -- ?
<s> Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
<s> Mars.
<s> No. Why? Are you seducible?
<s> Me.
<s> Sure.
<s> No.
<s> All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
<s> I will.
<s> That I want you to take me home.
<s> That was read at my parents' wedding.
<s> Better. I was really angry.
<s> You'll be fine for a few minutes.
<s> Landon. I can't even do for myself.
<s> Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
<s> That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
<s> I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
<s> Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
<s> That won't be possible.
<s> Your parents are divorced?
<s> In there.
<s> I'm no dummy.
<s> For pay?
<s> Yeah.
<s> A similar triangle?
<s> I don't know. National Cash Register?
<s> Have we ever met before?
<s> How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
<s> But he didn't ask me.
<s> No!
<s> Good.
<s> Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
<s> Not now....
<s> Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
<s> But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
<s> Why?
<s> Why is she gonna get angry with you?
<s> George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
<s> Not a holocaust --
<s> Run out of gas?
<s> Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
<s> What?
<s> Five cents, please.
<s> No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
<s> Home, school, here... 
<s> Shhhhhhhh!
<s> Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
<s> So what? We'd be rich!
<s> You know me?
<s> A mall?
<s> We don't....
<s> What if you lost your keys?
<s> Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
<s> Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
<s> But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
<s> Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
<s> Perfect...
<s> 87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
<s> According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
<s> But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
<s> Sure,.
<s> No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
<s> What did you do to yours?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not bad.
<s> No, he showed me one.
<s> He never bit me.
<s> You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
<s> Tom...
<s> Is that right?
<s> It's okay.
<s> Well, stop the world.
<s> Spanish.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> But it would hurt.
<s> You don't believe me, see for yourself.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
<s> Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
<s> No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
<s> Yes?
<s> No.
<s> Just thinking.
<s> Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
<s> Hold it right there.
<s> New Jersey?
<s> You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
<s> Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
<s> Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
<s> There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
<s> And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
<s> Just 'grazed' you, huh?
<s> Not really.  This is pretty important.
<s> Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
<s> Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
<s> Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
<s> Everybody okay up here?
<s> Who were you really trying to kill last night?
<s> Pretty terrible shot.
<s> Who?
<s> Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
<s> She was killed, Penny.
<s> She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
<s> I wish he was.  He's real enough.
<s> Go where?  Where're you going?
<s> Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
<s> A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
<s> I have a radio fix...
<s> John Whorfin will kill us!
<s> Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
<s> Why me?
<s> Asshole probably got lost.
<s> Flying to Cambodia.
<s> Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
<s> What?! He's a son of a bitch!
<s> He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
<s> If I can. He gets jealous; he-
<s> Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
<s> What are they like? What are they about?
<s> You wrote his scripts for him?
<s> Before Bill came to Hollywood.
<s> All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
<s> W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
<s> It's still a little early for me.
<s> Well... actually, no Bill...
<s> I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
<s> Ever act?
<s> We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
<s> What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
<s> Who?
<s> He's a great writer –
<s> But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
<s> Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
<s> Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
<s> No, what did it say?
<s> I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
<s> Well, I'm a writer, actually.
<s> Can be. Not easy, but –
<s> Doesn't surprise me at all.
<s> I can feel my butt getting sore already.
<s> Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
<s> Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
<s> ...Yeah, okay.
<s> Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
<s> In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
<s> I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
<s> We gotta call the police –
<s> Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
<s> Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
<s> I'm at the Earle.
<s> I apologize, Barton.
<s> Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
<s> Mr. Lipnik.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
<s> Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
<s> Anyway.
<s> Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
<s> Ya see how he's not writing it down?
<s> She was there, wasn't she?
<s> Did you find out about her parents?
<s> You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I thought you quit.
<s> Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
<s> Tell me about Catherine.
<s> You saw all the reports, Beth!
<s> Put your hands up!
<s> I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
<s> Yes it does, doesn't it?
<s> You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
<s> You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> I'd like to ask you some, too.
<s> There's a name from the past.
<s> Do you?
<s> Don't get too cocky.
<s> To see if he can get away with it.
<s> No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
<s> Do you want her to join us sometime?
<s> Fine.  How's your back?
<s> I don't have a choice.
<s> Make love to me.
<s> For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
<s> I found Lisa Henderson.
<s> Really.  What are you writing about.
<s> We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
<s> I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
<s> The usual -- a girlfriend.
<s> Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
<s> She misses me.
<s> No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
<s> I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
<s> Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
<s> I know what that's like.
<s> You don't like punk rockers?
<s> Why the hell not?
<s> She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
<s> Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
<s> You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
<s> What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
<s> Are you vice?
<s> Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
<s> Did you check all four years?
<s> Rene's been telling me about your work.
<s> Not sure. How was yours?
<s> Let's get out of here.
<s> The whole thing – painting.
<s> What about the shit they write?
<s> Ignorant art?
<s> Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
<s> Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
<s> Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
<s> I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
<s> That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
<s> No.
<s> Sure.
<s> Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
<s> Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
<s> You mean like an ape?
<s> Should there be?
<s> Very well.
<s> Use your fucking instinct.
<s> Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
<s> Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
<s> Willie Mays.
<s> We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
<s> He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
<s> You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
<s> You're your own baby.
<s> How is he?
<s> What's that about?
<s> You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
<s> Hi.
<s> Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
<s> You don't even know me. I want real respect.
<s> Fuck...  I forgot about that.
<s> So what?
<s> What time is it?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
<s> It's vichyssoise, sir.
<s> I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
<s> Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
<s> Have we?
<s> You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
<s> Yes and no ...
<s> Treat to be here.
<s> I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
<s> Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
<s> Nor I, on the second.
<s> Y'mean take off our costumes?
<s> I'm not scared of you, Max.
<s> I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
<s> He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
<s> The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
<s> Dad!  Save yourself!
<s> Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
<s> The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
<s> Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
<s> I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
<s> I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
<s> Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
<s> Too good?
<s> I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
<s> Actually, it's a lot like that.
<s> Oh no, those things frighten me.
<s> What is it?
<s> Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
<s> Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
<s> No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
<s> Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
<s> Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
<s> What seems to be the problem?
<s> Coming on line now, sir.
<s> Pheromones?
<s> It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
<s> I recognized the accent.
<s> Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
<s> Divide and conquer.
<s> I'm afraid to ask.
<s> Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
<s> Mr. Freeze.
<s> Surf's up.
<s> From the other side of the equator-
<s> Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
<s> Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
<s> I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
<s> Bruce?  What are you doing?
<s> Presumed dead.  No one knows.
<s> I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
<s> Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
<s> But he's never said a word-
<s> You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
<s> You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
<s> The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
<s> At you?  Polly want a kiss?
<s> Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
<s> I think they're getting worse.
<s> Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
<s> Ninety-three, including the sauna.
<s> Which `they' might that be, sir?
<s> Recognition, of course.
<s> Mystery.
<s> I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
<s> Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
<s> Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
<s> Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
<s> No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
<s> Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
<s> Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
<s> Not much.
<s> The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
<s> Would you? I'm not so sure.
<s> The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
<s> So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
<s> What?
<s> What I do isn't about revenge.
<s> Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
<s> Paranoid? The psychotic?
<s> Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
<s> Miss.
<s> A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
<s> Which bathroom is that, sir?
<s> Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
<s> Take me. Let the boy go.
<s> ... Murderer...
<s> I know. I called them.
<s> Well -- I think you might consider
<s> I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
<s> Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
<s> That's why I wear a target on my chest.
<s> Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
<s> That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
<s> Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
<s> Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
<s> In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
<s> I wish you'd...
<s> Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
<s> I feel naked without it.
<s> Finding out where she is.
<s> I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
<s> JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
<s> Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
<s> That's it.
<s> Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
<s> A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
<s> All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
<s> Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
<s> ... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
<s> ... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
<s> Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
<s> It's gone.
<s> Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
<s> I said I'd check with you.
<s> That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
<s> What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
<s> It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
<s> Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
<s> Meaning?
<s> Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
<s> It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
<s> Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
<s> Thanks, Annie.
<s> Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
<s> Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
<s> She's ... well, she's good.
<s> Isn't it?
<s> Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
<s> Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
<s> Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
<s> Great - keep him out of trouble.
<s> I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
<s> Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
<s> Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
<s> Richard Burton was very good-looking.
<s> There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
<s> I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
<s> Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
<s> Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
<s> Why thank you sir.
<s> Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
<s> Me first! Me first!
<s> Huh huh huh.
<s> Heh heh. Thank God.
<s> Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
<s> Uh... I think you scared them off.
<s> Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
<s> Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
<s> Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
<s> Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
<s> Butt-snatch...
<s> Just make sure it looks like an accident...
<s> Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
<s> Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
<s> It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
<s> D.C., Chief.
<s> Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
<s> Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
<s> Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
<s> Yup. Huh huh.
<s> Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
<s> Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
<s> It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
<s> Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
<s> That's how long you were gone.
<s> De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
<s> This is going to take some time.
<s> I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
<s> That's my girl!
<s> No, I'm not putting up with this.
<s> You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
<s> She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
<s> That's all we need.
<s> We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
<s> No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
<s> Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
<s> It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
<s> Of course I did.
<s> Maybe we should knock first?
<s> The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
<s> Who did the sushi?
<s> Little black party dresses?
<s> We're ghosts.
<s> <u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
<s> God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
<s> Really.  I don't know.
<s> For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
<s> But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
<s> And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
<s> <u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<s> <u>Out</u>.
<s> Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
<s> Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
<s> Are you Juno, our case worker?
<s> No.  You don't want his help.
<s> What do you mean?  What's he do?
<s> I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
<s> Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
<s> Step... mother.
<s> That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
<s> 'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
<s> Are you a spirit too?
<s> It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
<s> You've got to help them.
<s> ... I will.
<s> I'm beeyoo-teeful.
<s> There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
<s> What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
<s> Delia hates it.
<s> Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
<s> This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
<s> I say let's keep it the way it is.
<s> Viridian?
<s> Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
<s> <u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
<s> Look at the tiny figures.
<s> I don't know.
<s> My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
<s> The attic.
<s> Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
<s> How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
<s> Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
<s> To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
<s> We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
<s> Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
<s> I don't think so, he should be along soon...
<s> You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
<s> I have no idea...
<s> Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
<s> There's no need for a hospital.
<s> Yes. Thank you.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
<s> No. I like it here.
<s> I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> Thank you, Eve.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Good night, Eve.
<s> No, Eve. I like you to be here.
<s> Thank you, Eve.
<s> Yes. I like to watch.
<s> That's very interesting, Eve.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
<s> Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
<s> I see.
<s> Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
<s> Your foot! Give me your foot!!
<s> Do you think so? Do you think so?
<s> Yes. I like that name very much.
<s> Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
<s> Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
<s> I see. I would like to work in your garden.
<s> But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
<s> Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
<s> ... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
<s> You're looking much better today, Ben.
<s> Yes. That is correct.
<s> Yes, Ben - he is.
<s> I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
<s> I understand.
<s> Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
<s> A flower...
<s> Yes. I like to watch very much.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh. Thank you.
<s> It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
<s> Of course. I would like to look.
<s> Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
<s> How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
<s> Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. That is surprising.
<s> I hope so.
<s> Yes. I was there with Ben.
<s> Yes. We need a very good gardener.
<s> ... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
<s> Yes, Thomas - I understand.
<s> No, I do not have any of those.
<s> Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
<s> Come now, Mr. Chance.
<s> As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
<s> That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
<s> No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
<s> ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
<s> We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
<s> There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
<s> Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
<s> Clearly, yes comrade.
<s> Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
<s> Right, Chief.
<s> Right, Chief.
<s> Oh? What?
<s> ... Mr. President, how good to see you.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Mr. Gardiner...
<s> Malkovich!
<s> The one where you're that jewel thief.
<s> I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
<s> Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
<s> Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
<s> Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
<s> I'm sorry. How was your evening?
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah. You want a beer?
<s> Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
<s> You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
<s> Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
<s> I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
<s> It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
<s> I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
<s> You've always loved the animals.
<s> Fuck Maxine.
<s> Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
<s> That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
<s> Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
<s> You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
<s> Holy shit, yes!
<s> Holy shit! He said what I said!
<s> Let me try.
<s> Let me try!
<s> It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
<s> I said "yes."
<s> I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
<s> Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
<s> Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
<s> The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
<s> The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
<s> How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
<s> How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
<s> Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
<s> Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
<s> I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
<s> What's he been in?
<s> Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
<s> Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
<s> Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
<s> I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
<s> Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
<s> Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
<s> Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
<s> Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
<s> Gehginnis ondah foam?
<s> Think, Jew florist?
<s> Count me in.
<s> We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
<s> Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
<s> No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
<s> I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
<s> I have to see you.
<s> One hour.
<s> A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
<s> Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
<s> Great then.
<s> Oh, I'm really glad you called.
<s> Do you mind?
<s> Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
<s> No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
<s> Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
<s> I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
<s> There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
<s> I'm saying they came into my yard.
<s> ..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
<s> Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
<s> We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
<s> I don't. I have my own.
<s> I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
<s> Yes ma'am..
<s> Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
<s> I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
<s> DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
<s> Morning, ma'am.
<s> NO!...She wanted me to do it.
<s> That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
<s> Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
<s> Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
<s> Ella.
<s> No use thinking these things now.
<s> It ain't what you think.
<s> She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
<s> She was only-
<s> Paul D.
<s> She was my best thing.
<s> Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
<s> Make it the way I always do.
<s> Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
<s> Huh.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Oh, man, don't say that..
<s> No, man, nothing is fucked here--
<s> You don't know shit, Lebowski.
<s> Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
<s> Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
<s> I am the Walrus.
<s> I'm going home, Donny.
<s> I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
<s> Were you listening to the story, Donny?
<s> Were you listening to the Dude's story?
<s> They were Nazis, Dude?
<s> You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
<s> Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
<s> Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
<s> That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
<s> And the, uh, the briefcase?
<s> Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
<s> Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
<s> I thought you might know, man.
<s> Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
<s> Jeffrey Lebowski.
<s> In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
<s> He fixes the cable?
<s> I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
<s> I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
<s> Do you still have that doctor's number?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
<s> But he's--
<s> I want a child.
<s> What?
<s> What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
<s> MARK IT ZERO!
<s> No, you're not wrong--
<s> Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
<s> When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
<s> Huh?
<s> Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
<s> The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
<s> My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
<s> It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
<s> What the fuck is going on there?
<s> Easy, Dude.
<s> What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
<s> I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
<s> Walter, please--
<s> I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
<s> Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
<s> Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
<s> They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
<s> All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
<s> Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
<s> And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
<s> Huh?
<s> Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
<s> All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
<s> Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
<s> What's your point, Dude?
<s> What the fuck are you talking about?
<s> Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
<s> He can't walk, Walter!
<s> Wha.
<s> Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
<s> Shit!
<s> Yeah?
<s> Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
<s> You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
<s> You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
<s> Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
<s> Bunny.
<s> Where's the money, Lebowski?
<s> I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
<s> You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
<s> YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
<s> This is a league game, Smokey!
<s> Impressive.
<s> They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
<s> You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
<s> Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
<s> You don't have to hunt to do it.
<s> I wouldn't read too much into it.
<s> Not good.
<s> These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
<s> I don't like it.
<s> Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
<s> For what?
<s> Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
<s> Human?
<s> Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
<s> Getting your attention, Paco.
<s> Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
<s> Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
<s> They've made contact with the Reapers.
<s> No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
<s> No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
<s> Scud.
<s> Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
<s> You're wrong.
<s> It's because I'm human that I can do this.
<s> I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
<s> Who is LaMagra?
<s> How do I stop it?
<s> Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
<s> There is no cure.
<s> What do you see here?
<s> Look closer.
<s> Like me.
<s> For your miracle cure?
<s> Cancer.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
<s> For them. But for me --
<s> Deacon brought me back.
<s> Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
<s> Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
<s> You're wrong, Dragonetti.
<s> Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
<s> Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
<s> Go on, I'll be fine!
<s> What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
<s> --which she may have--
<s> Join the club.
<s> Don't know--just that she was afraid--
<s> Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
<s> Closer.
<s> Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
<s> There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
<s> You sure?
<s> --<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
<s> You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
<s> Yes.
<s> No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> --no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
<s> Whatever you want.
<s> --no, what's wrong with you?
<s> I know, I know.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Both. Now.
<s> Well, please keep me fucking informed!
<s> Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
<s> Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
<s> It's not about witches, goddamnit!
<s> --which'd be about ten bucks--
<s> Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
<s> Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
<s> Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
<s> Yeah?
<s> --coming out of the water--
<s> --Cotter: shut up.
<s> --anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
<s> Fucking owl!
<s> No idea--goddamitt!
<s> Down there in the Park.
<s> How's she going to know where to--
<s> --I don't know.
<s> --I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
<s> Anna's the witch.
<s> --a Wiccan--
<s> <u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
<s> Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
<s> All I need--
<s> --still go see the OB in the morning--
<s> Enough to keep sane.
<s> Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
<s> Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
<s> Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
<s> At least you still have the tapes.
<s> Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
<s> Then I have no idea.
<s> It touched me, don't you see it now?
<s> Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
<s> --a <u>lot</u>.
<s> I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
<s> Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
<s> --his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
<s> Who <u>is</u> this??
<s> Yes.
<s> No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
<s> Meurice--
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
<s> Thanks.
<s> ...You ever get tired?
<s> ...What do you mean?
<s> Marty.
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
<s> Going out with Meurice.
<s> I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
<s> ...Friday?
<s> Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
<s> I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
<s> Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
<s> You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
<s> No. It just made them feel better.
<s> Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
<s> Ya catch any fish?
<s> I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
<s> You said the usual--
<s> Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
<s> Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
<s> Tuesday.
<s> Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
<s> Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
<s> Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
<s> You did? A human ear?
<s> Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
<s> I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
<s> It must be great.
<s> Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
<s> I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
<s> Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
<s> Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
<s> I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
<s> I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
<s> Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
<s> He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
<s> Jeffrey nothing.
<s> Nobody.
<s> I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
<s> You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
<s> No.
<s> Nothing. Are you alright?
<s> You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
<s> No. please. I won't.
<s> . same here.
<s> There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
<s> Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
<s> . or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
<s> I sure don't hate you.
<s> Sure I do.
<s> I'm doing it.
<s> No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
<s> Yes.
<s> Frank would open you.
<s> Beeeee careful.
<s> Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
<s> There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
<s> I want you to stay with me.
<s> Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
<s> I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
<s> I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
<s> No thanks. what does that mean?
<s> I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
<s> Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
<s> I'm here, aren't I?
<s> Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
<s> Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
<s> You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
<s> I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
<s> Oh, okay. can I call?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
<s> Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
<s> It's okay. Don't worry about it.
<s> I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
<s> . Actually. I've been in twice.
<s> Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
<s> I'm really sorry.
<s> Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
<s> Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
<s> What is it?
<s> I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
<s> I can't dance fast.
<s> Let's wait for some slow one.
<s> No.
<s> No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
<s> OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
<s> No Jeffrey!!
<s> Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
<s> uh uh.
<s> Alright.
<s> Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
<s> Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
<s> I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
<s> What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
<s> Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
<s> Derek!
<s> You happy, baby?
<s> You'll see for yourself.
<s> Yeah, I don't feel so well.
<s> Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> I see.  How much?
<s> We want some grass.
<s> We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
<s> It's your grass.
<s> Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
<s> It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
<s> Barbara and me.  No one else.
<s> You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
<s> Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
<s> I heard.
<s> It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
<s> Oh hey, one more thing?
<s> Get me a six pack.
<s> Not really, no.
<s> Murder.
<s> Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
<s> And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
<s> Just a friend.
<s> George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
<s> Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
<s> Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
<s> You went behind my back and you cut me out.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
<s> Today.
<s> Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
<s> Oh, I see.
<s> I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
<s> That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
<s> Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
<s> Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
<s> I didn't come here to drink scotch.
<s> Tough spot.
<s> Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
<s> Dad.
<s> Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
<s> That's where you belong...
<s> Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
<s> What do you guys want?
<s> Tuna.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
<s> My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
<s> You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
<s> Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
<s> Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
<s> Kristina's fine.
<s> Better than you.
<s> What's happening to us?
<s> Are we gonna split up?
<s> You can call me Dad if you want.
<s> California.
<s> You swear?
<s> Swear on my life.
<s> I know, Dad.  I know...
<s> I know, Dad.  I love you too.
<s> Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
<s> All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
<s> I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
<s> What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
<s> Who speaks Spanish?
<s> Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
<s> That's right.
<s> I understand. What's your question?
<s> Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
<s> Third group.
<s> Don't move, Hacene.
<s> It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
<s> It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
<s> Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
<s> It could've happened to anyone.
<s> Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
<s> What good does that do -- it's the old will?
<s> For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
<s> How?
<s> Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
<s> Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
<s> Sex.
<s> No -- never.
<s> Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
<s> You may call your next witness.
<s> She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
<s> Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
<s> We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
<s> Aren't they all?
<s> I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
<s> I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
<s> That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
<s> I assume his girlfriend.
<s> Rebecca Lawson.
<s> No -- but I can get it for you.
<s> Six years.
<s> Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
<s> No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
<s> Yes.
<s> We were lovers.
<s> What would she do that made it hard to resist?
<s> I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
<s> Thank you.  The State rests.
<s> We stopped seeing each other.
<s> Yes -- Insulin and others.
<s> No.
<s> Then -- those are not your own words?
<s> We dated for about a month last year.
<s> He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
<s> What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
<s> It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
<s> You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
<s> You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
<s> You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
<s> A.M -- or P.M.?
<s> Then you would have gotten your money?
<s> What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
<s> You didn't know about it before that?
<s> And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
<s> I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
<s> No pain, no gain?
<s> Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
<s> If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
<s> I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
<s> We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
<s> Sure.  Where to?
<s> Hi.  It's Frank.
<s> I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
<s> It won't be that hard.
<s> I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
<s> I went out on the boat.
<s> It's only the beginning.
<s> You can see me now.
<s> She's waiting in the conference room.
<s> I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
<s> "Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
<s> How often do you use cocaine?
<s> You better.  Please answer the question.
<s> I'm always open to learning new things.
<s> Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
<s> That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
<s> Where have you been?
<s> We can't pretend this isn't happening.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
<s> Daddy -- stop it!
<s> I nearly died when we split the bill.
<s> Why are there two deeds here?
<s> Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
<s> I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
<s> He's not coming.
<s> Michael.
<s> Come here a minute.
<s> Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
<s> '82.
<s> Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
<s> No, what?
<s> Heat is heat.
<s> Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
<s> After the divorce.
<s> How long you been married?
<s> You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
<s> Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
<s> I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
<s> I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
<s> We got engaged.
<s> They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
<s> Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
<s> I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
<s> I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
<s> No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
<s> Yes! Hi.
<s> Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
<s> Near the church.
<s> He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
<s> You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
<s> Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
<s> No.
<s> You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
<s> What makes it different, Robert?
<s> The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
<s> TO HELL WITH YOU!
<s> I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
<s> I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
<s> I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
<s> Hmm?
<s> Cremated?!
<s> Apparently just before her death.
<s> You people really don't like dogs.
<s> It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
<s> The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
<s> What the hell you talking about?
<s> Spooked?
<s> Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
<s> Damned if I know.
<s> Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
<s> But that's your old hood, Pops.
<s> Wh-wh-whooo?
<s> All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
<s> Where we'll always be...
<s> Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
<s> They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
<s> We met.
<s> You mean as opposed to your life?
<s> Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
<s> Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
<s> You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
<s> No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
<s> Mother!  No.
<s> My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
<s> You moved into this block?
<s> It's alright.  If you want to go home...
<s> Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
<s> Okay, okay.  Listen:
<s> I can't find you.
<s> Back here.  At the end of the block.
<s> Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
<s> A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
<s> Daddy?
<s> That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
<s> You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
<s> You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
<s> I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
<s> We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
<s> No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
<s> Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
<s> Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
<s> I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
<s> That building?
<s> Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
<s> Ours!
<s> What we have to do is call the police.
<s> Where's what?
<s> Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
<s> No!
<s> No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
<s> What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
<s> What are you going to do with it?
<s> I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
<s> There's no time.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What are you, drunk?
<s> Why?
<s> Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
<s> All right, Caesar.
<s> But it could be anywhere.
<s> Caesar, this is crazy.
<s> You don't, you can't believe that ...
<s> Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
<s> Don't tell him --
<s> Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> Sure, Gino, sure.
<s> Go right ahead, sir.
<s> Five.
<s> Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
<s> Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
<s> Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
<s> Oh yeah.  Violet!
<s> I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
<s> Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
<s> My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
<s> You're doing everything yourself?
<s> That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
<s> I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
<s> No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Why?
<s> Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
<s> Basically.
<s> What about that guy this morning?
<s> I suppose he just wants to watch.
<s> For what?
<s> In his office.  I saw it this morning.
<s> ...  shit.
<s> Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
<s> Trust me, Violet.
<s> Not Caesar.
<s> What happened?
<s> I thought you were never going to do that.
<s> I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
<s> -- if we can get a clean shot --
<s> You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
<s> ...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
<s> ...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
<s> They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
<s> Jason...  They can't let you go...
<s> Look, maybe I should just...
<s> 
<s> -- sir? --
<s> One moment, sir.
<s> Who?  Who came?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I don't know.
<s> What?  Like amnesia?
<s> Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
<s> 
<s> Nothing.  It's just not there.
<s> There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
<s> I guess.
<s> You got me pretty fucking curious.
<s> All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
<s> -- please -- Jason -- omigod --
<s> -- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
<s> -- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
<s> -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
<s> -- how? --
<s> Nykwana Wombosi. 
<s> I don't know. 
<s> xxxxxx
<s> xxxxxx
<s> Not really.
<s> I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
<s> -- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
<s> That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
<s> You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
<s> Abbott wants to talk.
<s> I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
<s> I fixed it myself.
<s> ...elephoned sir.
<s> ...ditioning.
<s> ... have a look.
<s> ...sabotage!
<s> You don't have to sing it.
<s> Layton.
<s> David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
<s> Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
<s> Well ... well, I ...
<s> Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
<s> Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
<s> Jack!
<s> You sound worried.
<s> Really? - God, how time flies!
<s> You remember Alison?
<s> Er, I knew you looked different.
<s> What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
<s> You killed him?
<s> I'm sure you have
<s> So how ...?
<s> Yes. I'm impressed.
<s> She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
<s> Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
<s> Why?
<s> Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
<s> I do. Goodbye. 
<s> There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
<s> Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
<s> Information Adjustments.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
<s> Suit me?
<s> Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
<s> You're joking.
<s> Let go! We've got to stop!
<s> Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
<s> Are you sure?
<s> It's not our mistake!
<s> Information Retrieval.
<s> I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
<s> Next of kin!
<s> Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
<s> Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
<s> I did it for you.
<s> I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
<s> Yes.
<s> A woman eh? I see.
<s> {suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
<s> I know, I know ...!
<s> Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
<s> No, sir.
<s> Numero, trois.
<s> Fixed itself.
<s> Who fixed your ducts?
<s> Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
<s> What is this?  Who the hell are you?
<s> But ... I called Central Services.
<s> ... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
<s> You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
<s> No ...
<s> Pregnant.
<s> Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
<s> She say she in great pain.
<s> We are virgins.
<s> He looks like a cop.
<s> He flipped out.
<s> Stressed? He's psycho.
<s> Mary said you might be coming.
<s> Mary, we really have to go.
<s> Got a beer?
<s> I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
<s> What did you say?
<s> It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
<s> Our Lady of Misery.
<s> You look so different.
<s> It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
<s> I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
<s> I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
<s> I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
<s> No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
<s> There's no time.
<s> He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
<s> What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
<s> She's no whore, Marcus.
<s> It's coming.
<s> Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
<s> No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
<s> I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
<s> Crazy fucker.
<s> Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
<s> Look out!
<s> I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
<s> Better bring it all.
<s> Frank!
<s> It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
<s> It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
<s> He's drunk.
<s> Relax, will you.
<s> You really think so?
<s> Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
<s> Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
<s> I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
<s> There are only ten.
<s> I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
<s> Are you any closer to a decision?
<s> This conversation is not worthy of you.
<s> You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
<s> Eleven and a half.
<s> I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
<s> Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
<s> A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
<s> Okay, great -- good luck.
<s> You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
<s> Then it went well.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I lost six pounds...
<s> This is important to me.
<s> Yes, I guess.  Yes.
<s> Sit down, stop.
<s> Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
<s> I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
<s> Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
<s> Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
<s> Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
<s> Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
<s> Oh, come on -- tell us another.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, there is.
<s> No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
<s> Should I...
<s> Right there, Bobbie.
<s> No, I don't think so.
<s> Bad manners.
<s> One's enough.
<s> Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
<s> No.  Really...don't worry about it.
<s> Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
<s> Okay, sweetie.
<s> I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
<s> No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
<s> We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
<s> No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
<s> 'Really a lot appreciate it...'
<s> I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
<s> Billion.
<s> Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
<s> Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
<s> Great.
<s> No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
<s> How can you say that to me?
<s> It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
<s> What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
<s> God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
<s> Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> I'm going home!
<s> I didn't finish talking to you!
<s> Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
<s> Oh it's enough...
<s> N-no...
<s> What!
<s> Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
<s> It wasn't easy.
<s> Yes Walter.
<s> Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Just about anything, Walter.
<s> What are you doing here so early?
<s> I'm totally serious!
<s> When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
<s> I do the research.
<s> Well I was uh, just looking...
<s> Well it sure looks dead enough.
<s> I didn't mean to.
<s> Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
<s> I don't have another cat!
<s> Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
<s> I can't talk right now.
<s> Hm.
<s> Smack?
<s> Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
<s> Yes, get rid of them...
<s> Did you like it Mister Brock?
<s> Here here!
<s> Really?
<s> That's really nice of you Mayolia.
<s> I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
<s> Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
<s> My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
<s> The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
<s> Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
<s> I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
<s> Let's move out!
<s> Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
<s> Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
<s> Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
<s> We hate you guys!
<s> Bummer metaphor.
<s> You didn't like them.
<s> Would you sleep with them?
<s> You think?  Split?
<s> Get away from here.
<s> You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
<s> What's playing there?
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> Probably.  What movie is this?
<s> Eeyuu.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
<s> Didn't you get my message?
<s> I think you've forgotten something.
<s> No...
<s> Buffy.
<s> Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
<s> I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
<s> Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
<s> You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
<s> But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
<s> I'm glad you came.
<s> You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
<s> Why don't we see a movie?
<s> Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
<s> Where?
<s> I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
<s> To bring you... your birthright.
<s> In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
<s> China.
<s> Lothos.
<s> I have to show you.
<s> We wait for Robert to wake up.
<s> But you enjoyed it, yes?
<s> Who we gonna beat?
<s> Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
<s> Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
<s> Try to pay attention.
<s> A what?
<s> I...
<s> Five.
<s> Not if you're careful.
<s> It isn't important.
<s> Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
<s> I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
<s> I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
<s> And where are they now?
<s> He knows who I am!
<s> That's the plan.
<s> Thank you very much.
<s> My parents have money...
<s> Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
<s> Really?
<s> I'm just a girl.
<s> Got that.
<s> Oh, baby!
<s> No --
<s> Throw it out.
<s> Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
<s> Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
<s> I gotta bail.  You coming?
<s> Does Jeffrey know?
<s> Wit-tay.
<s> Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
<s> Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
<s> A little better.
<s> No, no, it was great.
<s> No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
<s> I did.
<s> I'll be back when we lose.
<s> it's okay..
<s> I think I'm ready for the Show.
<s> I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
<s> Crash, I didn't think you--
<s> Oh my...  Don't leave...
<s> Yep.
<s> Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
<s> You got me all confused.
<s> I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
<s> I want to be had.
<s> I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
<s> Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
<s> There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
<s> Yeah...you a witch?
<s> What?
<s> Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
<s> He looks wonderful, Jackson...
<s> Oh let's not...
<s> You got a live arm there.
<s> You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
<s> Who's he play for?
<s> You missed him!
<s> No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
<s> Beg me again!
<s> I thought I was--
<s> Well, I held it like an egg.
<s> God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
<s> Naw...
<s> By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
<s> I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
<s> If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
<s> Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
<s> Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
<s> Yep.  So how's Annie?
<s> Then go.
<s> Let go of me!
<s> My right.
<s> No.
<s> Crash, shut the door.
<s> Love to--
<s> Can I give you my testimony?
<s> Better find our bonus baby, eh?
<s> I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
<s> --we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
<s> Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
<s> Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
<s> He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
<s> He goes to a whorehouse every night?
<s> ...he did what he was told.
<s> This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
<s> Liar.
<s> Philip, if you would rise.
<s> These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
<s> What do you propose?
<s> They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
<s> ...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
<s> 702 472 1862.
<s> Help, Daddy!
<s> Matter of fact...
<s> Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
<s> Somethin', huh?
<s> Honey, come here.
<s> You mean, I have your permission?
<s> And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
<s> ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
<s> Listen...
<s> Hey.
<s> I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
<s> Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
<s> Yeah.
<s> A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
<s> No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
<s> Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
<s> I see you, you motherfuckers.
<s> Practice enough this week, you prick?
<s> What people?
<s> I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
<s> You never - ?
<s> And what'd she want?
<s> Well...
<s> No, that's quite all right.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
<s> Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
<s> ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
<s> Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
<s> Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
<s> Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
<s> We can't get rid of him?
<s> Certainly.  Senator.
<s> Who's this?
<s> Okay. 
<s> She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
<s> I - I - I...
<s> I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah. Yeah.
<s> Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
<s> All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
<s> ...they didn't know what really moved her.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> Okay.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> I don't need one.
<s> Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
<s> It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
<s> He needed some clothes.
<s> He wanted a watch, too.
<s> I threw it away.
<s> Who were you with?
<s> I can back him off.
<s> ...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
<s> Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
<s> Listen to me.
<s> You fuckin' whore!
<s> I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
<s> Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
<s> Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
<s> We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
<s> How many kids do you have?
<s> What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
<s> Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
<s> Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
<s> You're firin' me?
<s> That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
<s> You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
<s> Can't do it with both hands?
<s> God! 
<s> Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
<s> You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
<s> Get out of here.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
<s> Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
<s> What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
<s> Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
<s> ...fuckin' jerk-off.
<s> Nicky, I'm sorry.
<s> Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
<s> Yeah. Fuck him.
<s> Great!
<s> Carmine's gone.
<s> I'm over here now.
<s> Oh.
<s> Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
<s> We can't help him if -
<s> For what?
<s> Hm.
<s> Ma che cazzo!
<s> Mm.
<s> Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
<s> He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
<s> Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
<s> All right?
<s> Oh, come on.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Bye.
<s> Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
<s> I don't - 
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yes, you are.
<s> Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
<s> I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
<s> All right. Be careful.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> You are.
<s> You do?
<s> Here.
<s> It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
<s> Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
<s> Boy, look at this place, huh?
<s> All right.
<s> What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
<s> Stacy. 
<s> Nicky sends his warmest regards.
<s> But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
<s> Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
<s> I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
<s> Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
<s> Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
<s> No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
<s> Mr. Chairman -
<s> Oh, sorry -
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
<s> ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
<s> Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
<s> You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
<s> All right, all right. But I - I -
<s> You are right. What can I...
<s> I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
<s> Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
<s> Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
<s> I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
<s> Guilty. I am.
<s> Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
<s> There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
<s> You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
<s> Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
<s> But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
<s> It may be time to get the police involved...
<s> Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
<s> Wha-at?
<s> I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
<s> Even the skylight?
<s> What about "climbing in?"
<s> Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
<s> I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
<s> Now he'll be up all night...
<s> A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
<s> Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
<s> I still have one left...
<s> I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
<s> You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
<s> Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
<s> But of course you are.
<s> Not too cool...
<s> Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
<s> What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
<s> Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
<s> Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
<s> You going to talk all day?
<s> I don't see anybody in there but you.
<s> Taking messages.
<s> That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
<s> This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
<s> Then whose is it?
<s> I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
<s> I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
<s> Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
<s> Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
<s> It's taken care of.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
<s> That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
<s> I improved on the fucking original.
<s> Satisfied, Wiseass?
<s> Allow me.
<s> I was worried about you.  Both of you.
<s> I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
<s> They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
<s> They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
<s> You won't disconnect.
<s> I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
<s> No -- nothing.
<s> One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
<s> Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
<s> I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
<s> Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
<s> How much time do you have left on it?
<s> And that was the end of it?
<s> Sometimes I paint.
<s> Pictures.
<s> A price on everything.
<s> That's not her.
<s> She's gone --
<s> The City National on San Vincente.
<s> Don't say that.
<s> Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
<s> I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
<s> Why can't it be her?
<s> She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
<s> They put their hands all over me.
<s> There isn't any such person.
<s> Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
<s> Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
<s> As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
<s> There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
<s> You could've hit me.
<s> I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
<s> I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
<s> Why are we stopping?
<s> As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
<s> Took preparation.
<s> You won't live to see it.
<s> Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
<s> You're up on your details, aren't you?
<s> Keep talking.
<s> Got a phone in that van?
<s> Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
<s> I wish it had never been invented.
<s> We don't see you.
<s> Just relax.
<s> I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
<s> You'll still have the girl and the husband.
<s> And if you ditch us we get zilch.
<s> The fuck I will!
<s> I suppose you're in your taxi?
<s> Are you busting my chops or what?
<s> Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
<s> Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
<s> An excellent quality.
<s> Did I?
<s> You heard me --
<s> Fucking mad!
<s> Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
<s> She's not a tart.
<s> She's not that either.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Scottish?
<s> Not me.
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> You know.
<s> You can't leave me then, can you?
<s> I wonder.
<s> Must be.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Never said a truer word.
<s> Must be.
<s> A little.
<s> Anything.
<s> Afraid so.
<s> A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
<s> It's a secret.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Prescription. For my condition.
<s> I will be.
<s> Let them come then.
<s> Yes.
<s> Love you, Dil.
<s> Anything.
<s> Do I?
<s> Will I see you again?
<s> Stop it, Dil --
<s> Carnations.
<s> Need to lose myself awhile.
<s> Horny bastard.
<s> Someone's got to do it.
<s> Suits you.
<s> Yes.
<s> No way, Jude. I'm out.
<s> And what happens then?
<s> And what if you don't?
<s> Some judge...
<s> The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
<s> I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
<s> Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
<s> Definitely unusual.
<s> Right.
<s> Can't eat through a canvas bag.
<s> No. It's the truth.
<s> Could you?
<s> So I've noticed.
<s> I'm talking about your people, not you.
<s> She's not my type.
<s> What?
<s> She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
<s> Don't I know it.
<s> We got simple tastes, you and me.
<s> But you fellas never get a break, do you?
<s> Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
<s> What do you believe in?
<s> It's as simple as that?
<s> Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
<s> Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
<s> I don't know her.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Hurling --
<s> Tell me, Jody
<s> You shut your face --
<s> Shut the fuck up, Jude.
<s> No, we are.
<s> You're crazy --
<s> Where are you, ol' buddy?
<s> You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
<s> First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
<s> That's right.
<s> It's all right -- look.
<s> Why do you think I brought you here?
<s> No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
<s> You're going to look for him -- now?
<s> Why?
<s> Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
<s> Look.
<s> Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
<s> Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
<s> You mean spies and things like that?
<s> We? You mean you're --?
<s> May I have a sandwich, please?
<s> So that was it.
<s> Oh, I see.
<s> Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
<s> No.
<s> Can I at least keep the onion soup?
<s> But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
<s> Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
<s> Agents.
<s> The last one, please.
<s> Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
<s> Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
<s> We wait -- with our mouths shut.
<s> The view had better be worth it.
<s> But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
<s> I'll take that.
<s> I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
<s> But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
<s> I met a man with sharp nails.
<s> Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
<s> Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
<s> Cutting it out.
<s> What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
<s> I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
<s> But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
<s> You mean, you're a thief?
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
<s> How much is it worth?
<s> Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
<s> Here's ten.
<s> That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
<s> No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
<s> Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
<s> Leave me alone -- !
<s> I'm very cold.
<s> Leave?
<s> He didn't have one.
<s> I don't know. I suppose so.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.
<s> -- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
<s> A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
<s> You give up awfully easy, don't you?
<s> I'm Regina Lampert.
<s> Now you're angry.
<s> Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
<s> It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
<s> Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
<s> The man and the woman are married --
<s> He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
<s> Having a nervous breakdown.
<s> He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
<s> Be careful, Peter.
<s> There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
<s> Don't put yourself out.
<s> Va jouer, mon ange.
<s> Because I don't love him.
<s> Don't you want me to stay?
<s> At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
<s> The American Embassy.
<s> He took care of Charlie for us.
<s> Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
<s> You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
<s> WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
<s> But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
<s> Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
<s> Daddy you scared me!
<s> I thought you'd be pleased.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
<s> I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
<s> She just turned off her light.
<s> No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
<s> A bullet to the right cerebellum.
<s> No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
<s> I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
<s> Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
<s> Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
<s> I don't watch him eat everyday.
<s> Ok.
<s> You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
<s> Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
<s> Twenty eight years ago.
<s> I'll think about it.
<s> Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
<s> What?
<s> Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
<s> I love you.
<s> Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
<s> Pretend we're just another couple.
<s> That's what he said.
<s> What?
<s> You didn't believe her?
<s> And the police did nothing?
<s> The men. Do any of them still live around here?
<s> Just thinking about something.
<s> Hi Sandy.
<s> Did you want one?
<s> They're tasty.
<s> No.
<s> Told you to hide it.
<s> Yes. Unfair to me.

<s> But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
<s> Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

<s> Well, well, well.

<s> His girlfriend?
<s> That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
<s> Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
<s> The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

<s> How did she...  ...happen to have them?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
<s> Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
<s> Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
<s> Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
<s> Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
<s> Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
<s> Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
<s> Did you have affairs?
<s> Did he know?
<s> Where you were when your husband died.
<s> No, not for that one.
<s> Been meaning to talk to you about that.
<s> No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
<s> Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
<s> Yes. He never forgave him for it.
<s> For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
<s> What dam?
<s> What? What is it?
<s> Get in the car.
<s> I gave everybody the night off.
<s> What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
<s> Your eye.
<s> There's something black in the green part of your eye.
<s> You saw my fa... father? When?
<s> The police?
<s> Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
<s> ...That's not what I meant.
<s> What did you do that for?
<s> No...
<s> I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
<s> Where can we go?
<s> With us.
<s> But, Mr. Gittes.
<s> I think I got something.
<s> Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
<s> Oh no.
<s> We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
<s> J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
<s> And Mulwray isn't?
<s> Maybe he takes it very seriously.
<s> Yes...
<s> Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
<s> Well, no.
<s> When it comes? What'd you tell him?
<s> Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
<s> Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
<s> Who?
<s> But...
<s> But I have to know.
<s> Yes. Yes, they were partners.
<s> Yeah.
<s> She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
<s> You don't say?
<s> ...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
<s> Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
<s> No...
<s> Too bad!
<s> Come in, Alfredo.
<s> What you say is wonderful! But sad...

<s> That looks pretty nice.
<s> Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
<s> Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
<s> Hello, Bernstein.
<s> I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
<s> Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
<s> It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
<s> We've got a nice plant here.
<s> Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
<s> It isn't finished?
<s> Has he said when he'll finish?
<s> I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
<s> The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
<s> I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
<s> Emily -
<s> Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
<s> But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
<s> You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
<s> I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
<s> I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
<s> Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
<s> Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
<s> If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
<s> You're no Venus de Milo.
<s> In the water.
<s> On the chiffonier.  Here.
<s> Oh, me -
<s> Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
<s> Half past eleven.
<s> Half past eleven.
<s> You're my wife, Susan, and -
<s> We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
<s> Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
<s> Susan, it seems to me -
<s> No, you're not.
<s> I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
<s> If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
<s> You can't.
<s> Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
<s> Can you prove it isn't?
<s> Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
<s> Persia.  It belonged to a king.
<s> People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
<s> How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
<s> Good.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
<s> I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
<s> I'll get you some coffee.
<s> That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
<s> Why, Brad?
<s> She's going to leave you -
<s> Are you finished?
<s> Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
<s> Yes.
<s> Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
<s> All we saw on that screen was a big American -
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Good!
<s> I'll have a highball.
<s> She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
<s> Am I sure about what?
<s> What is this, a poll?
<s> It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
<s> It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
<s> What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
<s> The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
<s> I take it she likes the guy.
<s> Exactly.
<s> You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
<s> What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
<s> How like her.
<s> And you came here to what? To comfort me?
<s> Sang? His name is a past tense?
<s> You lie.
<s> Jesus, you're caustic.
<s> So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
<s> But can we date?
<s> You have a better suggestion?
<s> I hear that's a rather popular date.
<s> What about Sing?
<s> He's your fiancé.
<s> I'm just kidding.
<s> I left like an hour ago.
<s> What time was this?
<s> Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
<s> I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
<s> To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
<s> Lenin's Tomb.
<s> Are you open?
<s> What's your point?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I thought Redding had like three balls!
<s> Bunch of savages in this town.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> You called Caitlin again?
<s> Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
<s> That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
<s> What do you mean?
<s> That girl was vile to you.
<s> Chess team Allan Harris?!
<s> What about Veronica?
<s> Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
<s> Blasphemy.
<s> Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
<s> The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
<s> Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
<s> Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
<s> Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
<s> All of them.
<s> Why not?
<s> Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
<s> What?
<s> I know.
<s> No argument here. Insubordination rules.
<s> We're not playing in the street.
<s> Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
<s> Exactly. They drank it all.
<s> You've had sex with a dead person.
<s> Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
<s> I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
<s> I'm going with you.
<s> Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
<s> Balls resting on his lips.
<s> What, your dick?
<s> Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
<s> Let me borrow your car.
<s> It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
<s> And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
<s> I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
<s> No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
<s> Could be.
<s> I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
<s> I was born.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Leave me alone.
<s> You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
<s> You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
<s> THE GLADES MOTEL?
<s> They are not.
<s> How much can you bench?
<s> Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
<s> One seventy-nine.
<s> A half hour.
<s> I should start.
<s> It's not my store.
<s> We were going to start again, I think.
<s> Maybe.
<s> She's my girlfriend.
<s> No, he got hit by a bus.
<s> Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
<s> The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
<s> Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
<s> Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
<s> Three including you.
<s> After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
<s> After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
<s> He gets off on it.
<s> Please calm down.
<s> ...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
<s> ...it isn't there. Yes.
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't want to go back with her...
<s> Randal...?
<s> Can I have your name please?
<s> WHAT?
<s> An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
<s> The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
<s> Scumbag. What are you doing?
<s> He's your cousin?
<s> He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
<s> Swear.  Olaf, metal!
<s> He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
<s> I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
<s> That's tight. Solid.
<s> That's sick, Dante.
<s> I like the way you think.
<s> I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
<s> You're gonna be at John K's party?
<s> Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
<s> Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
<s> Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
<s> Which one?
<s> Says who?
<s> That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
<s> Hal will have my head for this.
<s> I copy.
<s> I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
<s> You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
<s> Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
<s> Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
<s> If you want, do it.  I don't care.
<s> Would you?
<s> My pleasure.
<s> That's it, you look like a professional.
<s> I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
<s> Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
<s> The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
<s> We spent a night there one night...
<s> Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
<s> On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
<s> Why are you yelling?
<s> He doesn't want my help.
<s> He can handle it.
<s> I only came back for you.
<s> How'd you get up here?
<s> For the same reason you did, to help.
<s> I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
<s> Call me sentimental.
<s> Sure, just give it back when you're done.
<s> Breathtaking.
<s> Up ahead.
<s> What?
<s> Don't let me fall!
<s> We were going together before I ever let go of you.
<s> Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
<s> Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
<s> Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
<s> Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
<s> The best he can since you gave him nothing.
<s> Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
<s> The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
<s> How far?
<s> We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
<s> When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
<s> Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
<s> It looks like a winding route.
<s> On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
<s> Let's move your ass in there!!
<s> We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
<s> Then go fetch.
<s> I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
<s> Good morning, Walt.
<s> For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
<s> Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
<s> Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
<s> Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
<s> Of course. Food alright?
<s> Try the wine!
<s> Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
<s> No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
<s> But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
<s> Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
<s> Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
<s> I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
<s> Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
<s> Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
<s> That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
<s> That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
<s> Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
<s> Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
<s> Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
<s> Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
<s> Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
<s> Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
<s> No, brother. What d'you want?
<s> Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
<s> C of E, sir.
<s> Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
<s> Blue eyes, yes, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
<s> Vitamins will it be then?
<s> I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
<s> Yes!!!
<s> I haven't seen you before.
<s> Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
<s> Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
<s> That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
<s> Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
<s> Good. I'm glad
<s> But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
<s> Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
<s> They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
<s> Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
<s> You have, my son.
<s> The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
<s> Prison custody?
<s> Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
<s> Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
<s> Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
<s> Sir.
<s> And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
<s> The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
<s> This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
<s> We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
<s> What?
<s> I used to play this piece back in high school.
<s> Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
<s> No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
<s> Bottega.
<s> How often you go?
<s> Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
<s> No, no, <u>wait</u>...
<s> Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
<s> Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
<s> ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
<s> Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
<s> He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
<s> Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
<s> What's your name?
<s> What am I gonna do with flowers?
<s> Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
<s> I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
<s> ...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
<s> Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
<s> Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
<s> Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
<s> I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
<s> ...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
<s> I'm trying...
<s> Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
<s> It's a mess.
<s> They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
<s> Play music.
<s> How can you kill him like that?
<s> Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
<s> Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
<s> Believe it.
<s> I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
<s> Lenny, my dispatcher.
<s> I need the job.
<s> Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
<s> Leave me alone.
<s> I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
<s> I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
<s> Makes two of us.
<s> Who?
<s> Some living.
<s> That's the reason?
<s> What happened to you?
<s> Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
<s> Slow down.
<s> Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
<s> Any special reason?
<s> But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
<s> The guy came right at us!
<s> Just drop me off.
<s> You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
<s> Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
<s> Shut the hell up.
<s> Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
<s> Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
<s> I think you're different.
<s> No.
<s> You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
<s> Switch the charts.
<s> I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
<s> For what?
<s> That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
<s> Yeah.  I think so.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Believe you about what?
<s> Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
<s> Getting rid of my hub!
<s> How is it possible?
<s> Not this again.
<s> What van?
<s> They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
<s> Realized what?
<s> Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
<s> Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
<s> Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Not today.
<s> You go.  Send me a postcard.
<s> No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
<s> Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
<s> It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
<s> You knew just what I was there for.
<s> Where are you?
<s> What about you?
<s> It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
<s> You think it's a conspiracy?
<s> Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
<s> You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
<s> Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
<s> Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
<s> Terminal?
<s> Yes, that's right.
<s> If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Working.
<s> I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
<s> Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
<s> Not today...
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Wait --
<s> You don't understand --
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> No doubt.
<s> Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
<s> What?  Why?
<s> Actually I'm running late --
<s> As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
<s> ... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
<s> Good luck, David.
<s> What would you have me say, David?
<s> How soon will you be able to decode it?
<s> A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
<s> Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
<s> Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
<s> This is how you see the sky?
<s> It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
<s> This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
<s> You want to classify prime numbers?
<s> You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
<s> And a hundred mile airspace.
<s> If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
<s> But what do I say?
<s> Okay.
<s> Many others.
<s> Can you help us?
<s> But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
<s> Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
<s> Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
<s> That's my girl...  Lights.
<s> You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
<s> Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
<s> That's what they all say.
<s> Peter Valerian.
<s> Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
<s> They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
<s> And?
<s> Jesus --
<s> Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
<s> Peter.
<s> Wait -- hold on a minute --
<s> Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
<s> Now you know.
<s> Can you try?
<s> And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
<s> Some of my best friends are scientists.
<s> You're willing to die for this.
<s> I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
<s> I'm sorry -- I can't --
<s> -- I don't know --
<s> And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
<s> I'm not sure it's come to that.
<s> In other words.
<s> Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
<s> Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
<s> Git movin', I said.
<s> Cut that backsass!
<s> It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
<s> We work down in the ditch?
<s> Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
<s> Here, Mom.
<s> Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
<s> You steal a car?
<s> I... I... I...
<s> No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
<s> Yes, Boss.
<s> Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
<s> Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
<s> Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
<s> He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
<s> What for?
<s> Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
<s> Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
<s> Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
<s> They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
<s> Like an elephant.
<s> That fool. That damn fool.
<s> No more than five. For a cold drink.
<s> Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
<s> Gettin' up, Carr.
<s> Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
<s> Well, how far didya get?
<s> Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
<s> This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
<s> No. No chains either.
<s> But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
<s> Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
<s> Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
<s> Tell her about <u>what</u>?
<s> What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
<s> You get me out first.
<s> I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
<s> You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
<s> You come and visit.
<s> That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
<s> Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
<s> Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
<s> For months... last October.
<s> How did you know they were stockings?
<s> I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
<s> Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
<s> He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
<s> Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
<s> Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
<s> He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
<s> It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
<s> W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
<s> He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
<s> Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
<s> The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
<s> Yes.  I have to go...
<s> <u>What</u>?...
<s> Go and look for a note.
<s> I know, baby.  I know.
<s> Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
<s> He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
<s> Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
<s> Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
<s> Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
<s> My promise.
<s> You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
<s> Look at him, grandstanding...
<s> Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
<s> Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
<s> I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
<s> Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
<s> That's always your privilege, sir.
<s> Yessir.
<s> I know.  Get out here.
<s> You're damn right I do.
<s> Helen Hudson...
<s> Because I think I'm wrong.
<s> "Spokes<u>person</u>."
<s> No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
<s> She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
<s> Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
<s> Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
<s> At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
<s> My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
<s> When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
<s> Are you still involving me in your crash?
<s> Hard to say.
<s> Yes.
<s> You could get your wish at any moment.
<s> You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
<s> What?
<s> We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
<s> We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
<s> I miss Beast a lot, too.
<s> Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
<s> Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
<s> Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
<s> I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
<s> Please, Letty.
<s> I'll be back before you can say souffle.
<s> Come on.
<s> I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
<s> We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
<s> And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
<s> Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
<s> A deal's a deal.
<s> Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
<s> There's a spider in my room.
<s> It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
<s> I guess so. I think that's right.
<s> Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
<s> By color.
<s> I've already checked it out 17 times.
<s> Good God.
<s> Exactly.
<s> The lady knows this is a dandelion.
<s> I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
<s> I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
<s> Tell the doctor.
<s> Your family just met me.
<s> Michael, I...
<s> But I do.     I love you, too.
<s> Home free.
<s> I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
<s> Open up.    I want to see.
<s> You like it?
<s> Do you like it?
<s> No.
<s> I'll be forced to tickle you.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I think I should call someone.
<s> I'm calling in sick.
<s> I'm going to the store.
<s> Yeah, I guess it's all right.
<s> That's a big question.
<s> You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
<s> I've met someone else.
<s> It doesn't matter who.
<s> No.
<s> I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
<s> Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
<s> That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
<s> Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
<s> I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
<s> Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
<s> I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
<s> It's Elvis...
<s> You're there now?
<s> My number's going to show up on his bill!
<s> You don't trust me?
<s> It's Daniel.
<s> When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
<s> No thank you.
<s> And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
<s> Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
<s> He missed three weeks.
<s> I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
<s> Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
<s> Why do I always have to answer the phone?
<s> I'm just setting my boundaries.
<s> No one? Then why is Zero here?
<s> And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
<s> I think he's already figured that out.
<s> Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
<s> We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
<s> Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
<s> I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
<s> You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
<s> All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
<s> He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
<s> What'd you get?
<s> You better.
<s> I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
<s> Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
<s> You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
<s> Good song though.
<s> The Holiday Hotel.
<s> And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
<s> What is it you do, Sami?
<s> We've got to get out of here.
<s> Relax. It will be fine.
<s> I'm the driver.
<s> I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
<s> Yeah, I can see that.
<s> Okay.   You can be Elvis.
<s> Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
<s> God, I want to go home.
<s> The baseball is mine.
<s> Get in the car.
<s> And you don't speak French?
<s> -- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
<s> Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Take a nap.
<s> Something like that.
<s> No.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
<s> Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
<s> That's why we're only breaking one arm.
<s> It's for you.
<s> I didn't have the heart.
<s> Wait!  I'm a friend!
<s> This Jade Fox is a woman?
<s> Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
<s> I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
<s> I'm just playing around.
<s> That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
<s> If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
<s> He is my defeated foe!
<s> Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
<s> My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
<s> Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
<s> Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
<s> His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
<s> Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
<s> How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
<s> Jen!
<s> My comb!
<s> Jen...
<s> I left the training early.
<s> No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
<s> Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
<s> Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
<s> Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
<s> You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
<s> It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
<s> Have you questioned him yet?
<s> She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
<s> It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
<s> To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
<s> Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
<s> Shu Lien...
<s> My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
<s> That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
<s> I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
<s> We must avenge mother!
<s> Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
<s> Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
<s> Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
<s> Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
<s> You don't say.
<s> I saw it, too.
<s> The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
<s> She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
<s> Mom tried to cook.
<s> I'm looking for a good guitar man.
<s> Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
<s> Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
<s> Another jolly nickname?
<s> T-Bird?
<s> I can see her.
<s> Does it hurt?
<s> Your pain ends now.
<s> Interested?  Follow the crow.
<s> Leave me alone -- !
<s> Go away.
<s> Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
<s> Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
<s> One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
<s> Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
<s> That's right.
<s> You what?
<s> I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
<s> No.
<s> What? Another letter from your friend?
<s> You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
<s> Refreshing.
<s> It's my house.
<s> What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
<s> Give it up.
<s> I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
<s> Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
<s> How about tonight?
<s> How was your date?
<s> I will.
<s> Okay.
<s> You must take me for a real idiot.
<s> Yes it does.
<s> No.
<s> You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
<s> I think that's for the best.
<s> Sure.
<s> I love you.
<s> What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
<s> I don't think that bothered him.
<s> Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
<s> Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
<s> Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
<s> You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
<s> Eww. No. That's gross.
<s> It was nothing.
<s> No.
<s> You'd do that for me?
<s> No.
<s> How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
<s> It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
<s> You think he'll like it?
<s> I know.
<s> I do.
<s> Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
<s> Yummy.
<s> I told you to lock the door.
<s> And you think she bought it?
<s> I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
<s> Likewise I'm sure.
<s> Outstanding.
<s> What?
<s> In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
<s> Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
<s> Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
<s> Shut up and turn to page 64.
<s> Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
<s> I hate it too.
<s> Cecile.
<s> I'm aware.
<s> What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
<s> Yeah.
<s> She's really getting to you, isn't she?
<s> I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
<s> Will you calm down?
<s> Get out!
<s> It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
<s> Oh please. I can't have you do that.
<s> Do you know where she is?
<s> Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
<s> I did?
<s> Oh... no thank you...
<s> Nope.
<s> How will I get to her?
<s> It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
<s> No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
<s> It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> At the old house with the voice.
<s> But it's already come true.
<s> She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
<s> Times have changed.
<s> No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
<s> But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
<s> I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
<s> Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
<s> I live right here.
<s> Daddy, it's true.
<s> I'm your friend.
<s> I can not tell you.
<s> No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
<s> A princess?
<s> Yes, yes! I see Prince,
<s> Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
<s> Oh, please!
<s> Don't cry, Amy.
<s> Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
<s> Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
<s> I'm trying to.
<s> Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
<s> I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
<s> It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
<s> But what happened to the little deer?
<s> If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
<s> Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
<s> Yes, yes -
<s> Anybody could know that song.
<s> Yes...yes, that's true.
<s> I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
<s> Good night...Barbara...
<s> Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
<s> I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
<s> That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
<s> I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
<s> No, it was another woman.
<s> I get crazy dreams and I black out.
<s> No it's mom.
<s> No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
<s> Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
<s> People notice you Frida.
<s> Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
<s> Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
<s> I'm sure they were exaggerating.
<s> Did I kill him? Of course not!
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
<s> I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
<s> I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
<s> No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
<s> He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
<s> Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
<s> Give him the tampon test.
<s> It is so hot in here.
<s> No you don't, believe me.
<s> It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
<s> You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
<s> Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
<s> Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
<s> Okay, I gotta go.
<s> You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
<s> Peter keeps asking me out.
<s> Check out what I found.
<s> Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
<s> You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
<s> Did I kill a guy named Benito?
<s> No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
<s> They say sex is great for cramps.
<s> I really gotta pee.
<s> I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
<s> I can't help it, it smells so good.
<s> You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
<s> This really isn't a good time.
<s> Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
<s> Yeah?
<s> On your desk.
<s> Your desk.
<s> I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
<s> Very well then. Is that all?
<s> Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Briefs.
<s> Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
<s> No. I was doing my laundry.
<s> Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
<s> Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
<s> Interesting possibility.
<s> This is a lot worse than "Betty."
<s> I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
<s> Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
<s> Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
<s> I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
<s> Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
<s> No, I said it was our first date.
<s> What makes you think I was the last one?
<s> You got a dog?
<s> She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
<s> Why would you want to be a cop?
<s> Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
<s> Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
<s> She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
<s> Like a vampire or some shit?
<s> Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
<s> Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
<s> Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
<s> The other one?
<s> Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
<s> How will we interrogate them?
<s> He's seriously disturbed...

<s> We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
<s> It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
<s> We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.

<s> No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
<s> It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
<s> Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!

<s> My Word
<s> It's just for a little while. You promised.
<s> What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
<s> Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
<s> Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
<s> I didn't know you taught.
<s> Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
<s> A madman.
<s> I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
<s> Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
<s> Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
<s> I'm calling her!
<s> Then you can help him.
<s> God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
<s> Father, I wasn't disputing you.

<s> Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
<s> I'll take him over mine.
<s> Yes.  But

<s> That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
<s> Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
<s> I guess.
<s> Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
<s> They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
<s> Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!

<s> He's not coming...
<s> So?
<s> Forget them...

<s> She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
<s> It won't open.
<s> Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
<s> Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
<s> Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
<s> Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
<s> I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
<s> Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
<s> No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
<s> No?
<s> Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
<s> Nick, she won't say why.
<s> Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
<s> Oh... You know...
<s> Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
<s> I don't know! I don't know either!
<s> I don't know.
<s> That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
<s> That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.

<s> Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
<s> Nick!... I thought you went home.
<s> Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
<s> That's my plan.
<s> Phantom Mary?
<s> Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
<s> Sure.
<s> What'cha got, Bennett?
<s> Wade's here.
<s> Wade did a little reminiscing.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Kimberly!
<s> Put that on your political resume.
<s> Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
<s> I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
<s> Later.  I want Doucet first.
<s> We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
<s> Out of the room.
<s> I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
<s> It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
<s> Not the 'T' word.
<s> You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
<s> Doucet killed my partner.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Bacon cheeseburgers.
<s> You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
<s> Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
<s> This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
<s> I'll be okay.
<s> No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
<s> How ya feeling?
<s> Hospital food.
<s> If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
<s> I'm signing off.
<s> No you don't.
<s> And you should be with your family.
<s> Take a look at this.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
<s> Jabez! Careful --
<s> They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
<s> Thank you, Belle --
<s> I didn't.
<s> A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
<s> Why? It don't hurt.
<s> Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
<s> All right, darling.
<s> Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
<s> I did not, Grandma.
<s> I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
<s> That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
<s> Belle.
<s> Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
<s> -- of what happens after we die!
<s> Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
<s> Look here now--
<s> He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
<s> Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
<s> Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
<s> Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
<s> Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
<s> They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
<s> Well, I --
<s> Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
<s> You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
<s> You want me to go around --
<s> You are not so sure that he'll come.
<s> Coming.
<s> Jabez!
<s> Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
<s> Oh -- Jabez.
<s> Yes, Mr. Selectman!
<s> But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
<s> No, no. I don't want to be idle.
<s> I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
<s> Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
<s> Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
<s> Consarn the consarn --
<s> Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
<s> And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
<s> But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
<s> Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
<s> Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
<s> Wouldn't profit him none.
<s> It don't matter!
<s> I say -- it don't matter.
<s> Sure, Ma.
<s> Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
<s> You aren't angry with me?
<s> Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
<s> Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
<s> I'll do my best, Mary.
<s> Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
<s> Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
<s> I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
<s> So, why didn't you come?
<s> That is Christmas music.
<s> I'll find someplace.
<s> Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
<s> Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
<s> He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
<s> You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
<s> It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
<s> Who are you, then?
<s> William Clay.  Call me Bill.
<s> We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
<s> Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
<s> No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
<s> Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
<s> I'm ahead of you...partner.
<s> 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
<s> Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
<s> I still feel like shit.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> What's it look like?  We're going in.
<s> Yessir.
<s> He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
<s> This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
<s> Don't let 'em off the ground.
<s> Yes, I would.
<s> What about the kids?
<s> They're not after you, they're after me.
<s> It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
<s> Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
<s> I'm really shakey.
<s> Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
<s> I know I am.  I know!
<s> What?
<s> All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
<s> That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
<s> Look... who's on the phone?
<s> Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
<s> Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
<s> Oh no!
<s> I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
<s> He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
<s> It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
<s> I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
<s> What are you doin' in there?
<s> They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
<s> Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
<s> So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
<s> Come on.  I want you to see something.
<s> They were ...
<s> There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
<s> Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
<s> Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
<s> Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
<s> Gimme the keys to get outta here!
<s> Give me the keys...
<s> They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
<s> I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
<s> What now, Sonny?
<s> What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
<s> They look like good kids.
<s> Special to me, too.
<s> Would I hire you?
<s> Why not?
<s> Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
<s> Howard!
<s> You were terrific, too!
<s> No, not until after they killed him.
<s> You stopped?  Why?
<s> You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
<s> My body?  What for?
<s> Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
<s> But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
<s> But I want to know what you think.
<s> All right ... send them the guard.
<s> What kind of a deal?
<s> What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
<s> Yeah ...
<s> It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
<s> They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
<s> Okay, Sonny.
<s> No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
<s> I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
<s> What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
<s> It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
<s> You follow my car. 
<s> I speak what I feel.
<s> I forgot she's in here.
<s> What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
<s> They're beautiful ...
<s> Yeah - it looks real official.
<s> My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
<s> If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.

<s> Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
<s> Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
<s> I don't follow.
<s> Don't we want them to talk to us?
<s> Oh, is this your special place?
<s> Can we eat there tomorrow?
<s> The second R is silent.
<s> A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
<s> LLOYD, she's my mom.
<s> I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
<s> Now you see why he was elected principal?
<s> You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
<s> When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
<s> HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
<s> You and me? Dream on, desperado.
<s> Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
<s> You can't marry my mom.
<s> Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
<s> I bet you want your head scratched.
<s> Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
<s> What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
<s> HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
<s> What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
<s> Am not.
<s> No. Look.
<s> He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
<s> Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
<s> Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
<s> I lugged it all over town!
<s> Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
<s> Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
<s> Roger that, Wilco.
<s> How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
<s> Damn! What are the odds?
<s> That's the one I wanted.
<s> Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
<s> Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
<s> Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> You know, "some". The fag stuff.
<s> Me too. I'm almost there.
<s> Looks like the best man won.
<s> I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
<s> It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
<s> So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
<s> No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
<s> Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
<s> Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
<s> The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
<s> No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
<s> Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
<s> Piter.
<s> Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
<s> So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
<s> Basically...
<s> That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
<s> I'm sorry Gurney.
<s> They said you were dead.  They said...
<s> Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
<s> Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
<s> Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
<s> Excellent!
<s> I'm ready.
<s> Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
<s> What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
<s> SILENCE!
<s> I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
<s> No.  I never drink -- wine.
<s> Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
<s> Ah, so I pull the strings!
<s> That's good.  I could use the money.
<s> Dracula?
<s> Ah!  This is very exciting.
<s> "Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
<s> So how'd we do?
<s> This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
<s> Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
<s> But maybe not.
<s> You'll be fighting with the octopus.
<s> This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
<s> I was thinking about killing myself.
<s> Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
<s> Formaldehyde.
<s> Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
<s> And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
<s> You mean a Tesla coil?
<s> Rolling.
<s> This is the big moment...!
<s> I made it up.  It's horseshit!
<s> Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
<s> Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
<s> Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
<s> I don't know.  It's so much money...
<s> Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
<s> Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
<s> I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
<s> Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
<s> Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
<s> Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
<s> Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
<s> But you used to say --
<s> But Bela Lugosi's in it!
<s> Hruphh...?
<s> Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
<s> Would that work?
<s> Tor!
<s> Mm, not good-lookink enough.
<s> But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
<s> But I thought me and Dolores had something.
<s> It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
<s> It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
<s> Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
<s> Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
<s> No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
<s> Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
<s> Oh.  My condolences.
<s> I just picked them up on the way over...
<s> Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
<s> Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
<s> The poor girl's out of a job.
<s> Who's Dr. Tom?
<s> No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
<s> You don't wanna be noticed?
<s> Lines around the block.
<s> So how long have you known Eddie?
<s> NOOOOO!!!
<s> No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
<s> You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
<s> Do they show it?
<s> Come on...
<s> Al!
<s> Al!!
<s> I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
<s> Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
<s> She doesn't give a shit about him.
<s> No, uh...
<s> Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
<s> I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
<s> Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
<s> You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
<s> Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
<s> What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
<s> Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
<s> What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
<s> When? Today?
<s> He made a mistake.
<s> He says --
<s> What's the matter?!
<s> Oh God. What hospital?
<s> Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
<s> The doctor said you were having sex.
<s> But Al is your husband now!
<s> Ma...
<s> And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
<s> Shari, Ray feels --
<s> She left.
<s> Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
<s> Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
<s> Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
<s> Welcome to work, Ed.
<s> So maybe this is my dynamite.
<s> Okay ...
<s> All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
<s> I missed you.
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> You should see the one we wear when it rains.
<s> The what?
<s> Why?
<s> I really like you too...
<s> So?
<s> Come on...
<s> Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
<s> No. It's your fault.
<s> What?
<s> What are you drunk?
<s> We're excited.
<s> What's the dif --
<s> She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
<s> It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
<s> No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
<s> You brought the cameras here!
<s> Save it.
<s> Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
<s> Me?! That's you!
<s> Who's Shari?
<s> What...
<s> Oh, man! So...
<s> So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
<s> Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
<s> Sure.
<s> Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
<s> If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
<s> Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
<s> pierdo.
<s> Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
<s> I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
<s> What kind of person?
<s> Here, get down.
<s> Yeah, uh, just a minute
<s> Yeah, just --
<s> Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
<s> What?
<s> Dick.
<s> Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
<s> I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
<s> Ethics are...
<s> Aren't you supposed to keep them?
<s> Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
<s> Good luck, Tracy.
<s> Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
<s> And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
<s> My mother's buying me a new car for college.
<s> Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
<s> Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
<s> Doing what?
<s> I've got an idea.
<s> Uh, Jim?
<s> Okay, Jim. I understand.
<s> I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
<s> I did it.
<s> I don't know. All I know is I did it I
<s> Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
<s> Dave.
<s> No, I... uh, didn't know that
<s> Still clear?
<s> Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
<s> Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
<s> Sherry... I love you.
<s> Okay, let's say
<s> So?
<s> I don't care.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
<s> Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
<s> Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
<s> It's not what you think.
<s> He's waiting for you to mention mention.
<s> It's Lynn.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
<s> He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
<s> Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
<s> When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
<s> Yeah.  But not for long.
<s> I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
<s> Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
<s> This business, Captain?
<s> Of course... But how?
<s> What work?
<s> I got to write my report first.
<s> Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
<s> What was that boyfriend's name?
<s> No!  Please leave!
<s> Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
<s> Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
<s> Lynn.
<s> <u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
<s> The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
<s> For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
<s> He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
<s> If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
<s> Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
<s> I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
<s> I don't know him.  Mr...
<s> You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
<s> Of course...
<s> I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
<s> It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
<s> I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
<s> All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
<s> Clean?
<s> Until he gunned down six people.
<s> I don't have time.  I have --
<s> Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
<s> Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
<s> Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
<s> He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
<s> In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
<s> Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
<s> Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
<s> At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
<s> His blood's always up.
<s> A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
<s> No.
<s> That's right.
<s> <u>Throwing me</u>?
<s> What?
<s> Give me a minute, will ya?
<s> I want you to follow Bud White.
<s> It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
<s> What?
<s> I want to do it right.
<s> I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
<s> Bud White's been here?
<s> Why's she seeing Bud White?
<s> I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
<s> Why?
<s> Some reality.
<s> I know how he feels.
<s> None.  Call it a hunch.
<s> What's Dudley's scheme?
<s> Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
<s> Officer White?
<s> Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
<s> I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
<s> Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
<s> Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
<s> Oh?  Anyplace else?
<s> It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
<s> You're not.
<s> Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
<s> The NSA?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
<s> I called from a payphone!
<s> Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
<s> They come after you?
<s> You sure?
<s> That wasn't so hard.
<s> What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
<s> <u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
<s> What if--
<s> Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
<s> A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
<s> Law enforcement?
<s> I'll say.
<s> Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
<s> <u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
<s> That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
<s> I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
<s> About what?
<s> I can't.
<s> Somebody took my blender.
<s> I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
<s> I saw a man die.
<s> In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
<s> No.
<s> How could you let me find out like this?
<s> Robert--
<s> "Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
<s> I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
<s> It's not real...  That's not me.
<s> Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
<s> I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
<s> This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
<s> This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
<s> A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
<s> Here, you can use this.
<s> Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
<s> I don't believe it is, no.
<s> I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
<s> That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
<s> That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
<s> I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
<s> You didn't squeeze DePinto?
<s> I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
<s> That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
<s> I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
<s> Why?
<s> The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
<s> We're screwed.
<s> You have to.
<s> It's not me?
<s> Merry Christmas, son.
<s> You're firing me.
<s> Good point.
<s> What are you talking--
<s> Hi, dad.
<s> Are those my Christmas presents?
<s> Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
<s> Alright!
<s> Did they take your clothes?
<s> You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
<s> Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
<s> Table 122?
<s> Bobby--
<s> Bobby--
<s> Why would the NSA--
<s> You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
<s> Bobby, you're in way over your head.
<s> Are you still in Crystal City?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
<s> I said fuck you.
<s> He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
<s> Get it.
<s> Hiding something?
<s> Sir--
<s> Dean's with Lyle.
<s> We don't know.
<s> What about the tape?
<s> Do you have visual?
<s> He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
<s> I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
<s> I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
<s> Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
<s> As the wife of one of our party.
<s> In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
<s> No.
<s> What?  No!
<s> It's a folk song.
<s> It's a long song - Szerelem means love…and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
<s> This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
<s> That day, had you followed me to the market?
<s> Shall we be all right?
<s> You will.  You will.
<s> A surprise, he said.
<s> Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
<s> I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
<s> Sorry, what's your point?
<s> Could I trouble you for some water?
<s> No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
<s> Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
<s> Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
<s> I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
<s> There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
<s> Okay.
<s> You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
<s> I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
<s> I liberated it.
<s> Are you planning to be the exception?
<s> Moose.
<s> I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
<s> Me?
<s> Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
<s> Off with his head!
<s> Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
<s> To arm-twisting.
<s> Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
<s> I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
<s> Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
<s> Are you remembering more?
<s> Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
<s> Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
<s> I've been told that before.
<s> Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
<s> Hey! -
<s> You'd better be.
<s> I'm not sewing anything else.
<s> I love you.
<s> The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
<s> Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
<s> I try not to expect you.
<s> I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
<s> No.  He's - no.
<s> Hello miss.
<s> Does he have to go?
<s> I had a hotel room.
<s> Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
<s> What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
<s> I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
<s> Why didn't I think of that?
<s> How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
<s> This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
<s> Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
<s> It's sold.
<s> Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
<s> No. Why would I be?
<s> Not a word.
<s> Give him the card.
<s> Can you follow simple directions?
<s> Look on the back. What do you see?
<s> No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
<s> What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
<s> I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
<s> They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
<s> That's because I wanted them to!
<s> We are...for the tools.
<s> A dozen times.
<s> Terrified. Still am.
<s> So you had to be your own lifeline.
<s> He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
<s> The Mask.
<s> No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
<s> A billion dollars.
<s> You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
<s> Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
<s> My job, my rules.
<s> You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
<s> Where the money is.
<s> It's no good without the argon gas.
<s> You've thought of everything.
<s> There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
<s> Surgically attached.
<s> No. You'll see when we get inside.
<s> Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
<s> Oh, I don't care about the money.
<s> Seen one billion, seen them all.
<s> They drive so recklessly there.
<s> We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
<s> You can do it.
<s> Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
<s> We need to make the trade tomorrow.
<s> Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
<s> Tina was a wonderful woman.
<s> It better be worth it for me.
<s> How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
<s> Remind me why.
<s> Check out my ball.
<s> You're impressed with her, aren't you?
<s> She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
<s> Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
<s> Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
<s> Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
<s> What do you think?  What's this?
<s> Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
<s> Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
<s> Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
<s> What's your point?
<s> Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
<s> Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
<s> Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
<s> Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
<s> Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
<s> Wow.  Why would they do that?
<s> I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
<s> Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
<s> Yup.
<s> If you hadn't used profanity --
<s> Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
<s> I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
<s> Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
<s> Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
<s> Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
<s> You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
<s> Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
<s> Erin --
<s> That's crazy -- why not?
<s> I know how DNA works, Erin --
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
<s> Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
<s> And that's what caused the contamination?
<s> Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
<s> We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
<s> PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
<s> Show me the document that proves that.
<s> Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
<s> D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
<s> I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
<s> I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
<s> Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
<s> Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
<s> "Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
<s> This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
<s> Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
<s> Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
<s> The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
<s> Right.
<s> Did he say why?
<s> Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
<s> That's right.
<s> At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
<s> Nope.  Maiden.
<s> Not anymore.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
<s> I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
<s> Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
<s> I'm gonna go live with George.
<s> You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
<s> Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
<s> No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
<s> How?
<s> Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
<s> Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
<s> Thinking.
<s> You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
<s> That's okay.  I understand.
<s> What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
<s> I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
<s> Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
<s> You did?
<s> Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
<s> Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
<s> And code the signal to my private chamber.
<s> Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
<s> Much anger in him, like in his father.
<s> The boy is our last hope.
<s> You must.  Luke, look at me!
<s> I can help them!
<s> I feel The Force.
<s> Everyone's invited, of course.
<s> No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
<s> Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
<s> Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
<s> Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
<s> Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
<s> Patience.  It's time to eat.
<s> It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
<s> There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
<s> You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
<s> He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
<s> The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
<s> If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
<s> I'm going to see what it is.
<s> Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
<s> Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
<s> I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
<s> And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
<s> Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
<s> Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
<s> I take it back.
<s> I'm against that.
<s> They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
<s> Yes, you do.
<s> Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
<s> Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
<s> Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
<s> The entrance is collapsing!
<s> No lightspeed?
<s> The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
<s> It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
<s> You look great.
<s> Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
<s> Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
<s> I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
<s> Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
<s> No hard feelings?
<s> Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
<s> Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
<s> Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
<s> Luke!
<s> It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
<s> I understand.
<s> I thought you knew this person.
<s> Let's go.
<s> I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
<s> What did you say?!
<s> I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
<s> Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
<s> Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
<s> Never.
<s> Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
<s> Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
<s> The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
<s> They look pretty docile.
<s> C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
<s> You never heard of Snake Plissken?
<s> Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
<s> Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
<s> Where?
<s> What?
<s> Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
<s> My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
<s> I got a new deal for you.
<s> Dream on, blue eye.
<s> My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
<s> There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
<s> Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
<s> No.
<s> No way.
<s> All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
<s> Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
<s> Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
<s> Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
<s> Yeah, kinda.
<s> If he lets you get close enough.
<s> Which way?
<s> Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
<s> Who?
<s> The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
<s> What the hell is this?
<s> Give me the prototype.
<s> Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
<s> Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
<s> I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
<s> But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
<s> Of Merlin?
<s> I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
<s> You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
<s> The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
<s> The dragon! There...
<s> ...of course...
<s> Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
<s> Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
<s> And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
<s> You freed it, son?
<s> --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
<s> Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
<s> Not you, my husband?
<s> The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
<s> You, my lord.
<s> You.
<s> I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
<s> The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
<s> --I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
<s> One land, one king! That is my peace!
<s> I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
<s> Thank you your excellency.
<s> Maybe the circuit is busy?
<s> Yes, I'm affraid it is.
<s> We still don't know.
<s> Not that I know of.
<s> No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
<s> What!
<s> What man?
<s> No thanks Karl.
<s> Why the math?
<s> Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
<s> Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
<s> Convulsion?
<s> No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
<s> It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
<s> He didn't mention her.
<s> If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
<s> But how?
<s> Could you see her?
<s> Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
<s> No.
<s> I found it.
<s> The closet
<s> No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
<s> Well, maybe he's sleeping.
<s> I wouldn't talk.
<s> Do you not like him like daddy?
<s> Honey it's to help you.
<s> Damien Karras.
<s> Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
<s> That's good.
<s> Okay.
<s> There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
<s> What's playing.
<s> You might loosen the straps then.
<s> You and us.
<s> Ego te abslovo.
<s> Bon Jour.
<s> Uoy era ohw.
<s> How's your leg?
<s> Okay
<s> No momma.
<s> I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
<s> But deliver us from the evil one.
<s> Who places her trust in thee, my God.
<s> The Lord be with you.
<s> Amen
<s> And let my cry come unto thee.
<s> Her heart.
<s> I've seen him.
<s> Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
<s> Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
<s> Unlikely.
<s> Is that a threat?
<s> Be silent!
<s> It's our goddamn car!
<s> No.
<s> You wanted to see me, Charlie?
<s> It's all there.  Both nights.
<s> Baker.
<s> How many?
<s> Go fuck yourself.
<s> I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
<s> How's the birthday girl?
<s> I thought maybe held gotten over that.
<s> Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
<s> Two nights.
<s> Am I late?
<s> Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
<s> Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
<s> Yamaha white.  Nice.
<s> Funny.  Strike a bell?
<s> So do I.
<s> You'll see.
<s> Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
<s> It's not family.  It's business.
<s> Yeah, okay.
<s> I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
<s> If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
<s> It's early.
<s> She'll get here.
<s> I told you I was gonna hit you.
<s> Here, how's this?
<s> That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
<s> I'll take my chances.
<s> Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
<s> First night?
<s> It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
<s> Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
<s> Good idea.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
<s> I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
<s> It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
<s> Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
<s> Fine.
<s> Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
<s> What?
<s> Huh?
<s> Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
<s> Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
<s> You always threw up.
<s> You're making things up, Frank.
<s> The tenth's out.
<s> Just until we find another girl.
<s> A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
<s> I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
<s> Who's weak now, big brother?
<s> I'll take the Mallory.
<s> Yeah?
<s> She asked for it.
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> Well, that's fine --
<s> Impersonally.
<s> We ran long.
<s> What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
<s> That's the premise.
<s> Time for what?
<s> All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
<s> Nine?
<s> Right.
<s> Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
<s> Piece of cake.
<s> The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
<s> Maybe.  I'll call him.
<s> First times. Hey, look at this.
<s> Great.
<s> Yeah.
<s> As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
<s> No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
<s> What?
<s> Uh, well ...
<s> Thanks, Lloyd.
<s> Funny job.
<s> So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
<s> Regular hours are eight to five.
<s> The name's Baker --
<s> Pretty much.
<s> I suppose.
<s> He'll come around.
<s> Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
<s> Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
<s> Every year.
<s> Hey, business is business.
<s> Just dinner and dance, right?
<s> Nothing.
<s> So, what happened?
<s> Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
<s> Frank wasn't 'there.
<s> If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
<s> We outgrew each other.
<s> Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
<s> Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
<s> I'm not much for sweets.
<s> They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
<s> Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
<s> ... Thanks.
<s> What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
<s> My place.
<s> Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
<s> Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
<s> You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
<s> Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
<s> So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
<s> Let me have a look.
<s> You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
<s> Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
<s> For what?
<s> Is that what you think?
<s> Were you there to catch me?
<s> One last time.  It's important ...
<s> -- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
<s> Jon, what is it?
<s> Would it?
<s> Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
<s> The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
<s> She doesn't know -- and she never will.
<s> Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
<s> Just make sure you're there.  On time.
<s> You said it, Jon, not me.
<s> I'm going to have you fired.
<s> Pollux is -- what?
<s> Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
<s> What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
<s> You mean like ... condoms?
<s> Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
<s> Well, I saw you -- Kim.
<s> That's your name, isn't it?
<s> No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
<s> You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
<s> Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
<s> Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
<s> It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
<s> Gone?
<s> So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
<s> -- Studying.
<s> That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
<s> You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
<s> Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
<s> No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
<s> I don’t think you’re hearing me.
<s> But I think I like you better this way...
<s> Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
<s> Sure.
<s> Got it.  Good tip.
<s> Like what?
<s> That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
<s> Great room...
<s> Is it...?
<s> She wants to have an affair with me.
<s> I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
<s> Hey, is that really necessary?
<s> It’s me, Jack...
<s> Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
<s> I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
<s> You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
<s> I've got everything I need.
<s> You still think this is about me, don't you?
<s> I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
<s> Do I look like I live in a bottle?
<s> You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
<s> Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
<s> Thanks.  To you too...
<s> Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
<s> How’d you do this year, Tony?
<s> For us, Kate.
<s> You hear me complaining about that?
<s> I was in the city.
<s> Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
<s> Because you’ll be here.
<s> No, she’s not.
<s> But it’s twenty degrees outside...
<s> ...my feet are hurtin’...
<s> Do what?
<s> Really.
<s> Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
<s> It’s good, right?
<s> Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
<s> No, open it...
<s> But I’m gettin’ close, right?
<s> Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
<s> What are you sure about?
<s> What are you talking about, Jack?
<s> Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
<s> No, Jack, I never got married. You?
<s> Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
<s> That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
<s> Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
<s> Do I know you?
<s> That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
<s> Of course I did.
<s> So we'll get egg nog.
<s> I wouldn't know anything about that.
<s> Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
<s> You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
<s> Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
<s> My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
<s> We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
<s> He's made a few changes.
<s> Victor's better at these things.
<s> <u>Should</u>?
<s> Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
<s> Yeah, nine years straight.
<s> This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
<s> Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
<s> Go back to the drawing board.
<s> Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
<s> Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
<s> Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
<s> The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
<s> And they're changing into...
<s> Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
<s> What do you mean "complete"?
<s> The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
<s> What about you?
<s> Ben!  Ben!
<s> This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
<s> Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
<s> They're not costumes.
<s> Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<s> Last one down springs for room service.
<s> Not this again --
<s> I think that thing is Ben.
<s> Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
<s> Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
<s> You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
<s> Hilarious.
<s> Sure.
<s> Reed, we're running out of time.
<s> Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<s> What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
<s> Never better.
<s> You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
<s> I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
<s> You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
<s> What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
<s> What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
<s> The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
<s> I gave him twenty.
<s> Victor, are you feeling alright?
<s> Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
<s> Here's the overall Target Area...
<s> Phase Two.
<s> No...
<s> The less time, the better.
<s> They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
<s> It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
<s> The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
<s> Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
<s> Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
<s> Can't remember?... What do you mean?
<s> Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
<s> It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
<s> They're much smaller than bacteria...
<s> But big enough for us...
<s> I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
<s> He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
<s> I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
<s> Not now. We need air, not greetings!
<s> Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
<s> I can't till the hatch is flooded!
<s> That's what they pay me for.
<s> I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
<s> A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
<s> Oxygenation...
<s> No, there's no other way.
<s> Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
<s> Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
<s> If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
<s> We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
<s> You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
<s> Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
<s> Sorry, but the situation has changed.
<s> Sort of.
<s> Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
<s> We can get out through the Lab Section.
<s> Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
<s> I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
<s> Yes, by all means. We must try it.
<s> I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
<s> Certainly -
<s> Certainly.
<s> No, that's not it, Jerry.
<s> Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
<s> What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
<s> Oh, now he's adorable.
<s> Oh, he's adorable.
<s> Where'd you get him that parka?
<s> Ya got that right.
<s> What'd this guy look like anyways?
<s> Yah, got a front movin' in.
<s> ...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
<s> Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
<s> Yah, that can happen.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Hold on.
<s> No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
<s> Ya kiddin'!
<s> We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
<s> Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
<s> Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
<s> I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
<s> Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
<s> Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
<s> I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
<s> Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
<s> My patience is at an end.
<s> We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
<s> Yah.
<s> ...Who they playin'?
<s> You told me about it.
<s> What's goin' on there?
<s> No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
<s> No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
<s> Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
<s> Well - it's cold, Margie.
<s> You don't think he's mixed up in -
<s> Yah...
<s> Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
<s> Well, how the heck are ya?
<s> Yah?
<s> Just a Diet Coke.
<s> No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Norm?
<s> His wife?
<s> Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
<s> Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
<s> Three-cent stamp.
<s> Yah.
<s> I love you, Norm.
<s> She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
<s> And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
<s> He was killed in action.
<s> ...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
<s> Really, what's that?
<s> It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
<s> Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
<s> "The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
<s> You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
<s> Sure.
<s> Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
<s> Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
<s> The girl had done her homework.
<s> Let's not make a big thing out of it.
<s> Should we?
<s> I suppose.
<s> The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
<s> Don't worry, I'm leaving.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
<s> We did make love?
<s> Answer the question!
<s> Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
<s> The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
<s> Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
<s> I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
<s> No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
<s> The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
<s> How's that working out for you?
<s> There's always that.
<s> Delivered from Martha Stewart.
<s> Do what you like.
<s> You called me so you could have a place to stay.
<s> I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
<s> It affords him other interesting opportunities.
<s> I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
<s> This is crazy.
<s> Strange.
<s> My dad.  No question.
<s> Hum.
<s> Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
<s> "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
<s> Doesn't matter.
<s> Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
<s> He was obviously able to handle it.
<s> No.  Not at all.
<s> Yeah, I'm sure.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
<s> Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
<s> I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
<s> I don't know...
<s> We don't... ?
<s> Nothing.  Do what you like.
<s> An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
<s> Tell him!
<s> Hey.
<s> Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
<s> What's this all about, Tyler?
<s> Why do people think I'm you?
<s> But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
<s> This isn't possible...
<s> What about Marla?
<s> Um, well... technically, no.
<s> Stop finishing...
<s> Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
<s> I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
<s> i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
<s> Why what?
<s> Why are you doing this?!
<s> What?
<s> Well, sir, you said you might.
<s> No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
<s> Pleeeeeease!
<s> Yesssss...
<s> Please, God, no...
<s> Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
<s> No, please, no, God, no!
<s> I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
<s> I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
<s> So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
<s> And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
<s> Random, sure.
<s> Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
<s> Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
<s> Carter.
<s> What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
<s> Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
<s> Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
<s> No.  What's this about?
<s> We have to tell her she's in danger!
<s> How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
<s> Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
<s> There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
<s> You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
<s> What feeling?
<s> I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
<s> I know, we'll be there soon.
<s> Who am I, David Blane?
<s> I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
<s> Thirty-nine.
<s> No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
<s> Don't do it! Don't do it!
<s> Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
<s> "Next?"
<s> Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
<s> They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
<s> You have a responsibility to tell me.
<s> No.
<s> Really?  How come he didn't take me?
<s> Star Wars?
<s> Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
<s> Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
<s> One hundred.
<s> Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
<s> Read you.
<s> AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
<s> Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
<s> Alright.  Home run.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
<s> It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
<s> I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
<s> Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
<s> Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
<s> In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
<s> How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
<s> How?
<s> Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
<s> Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
<s> Not yet.
<s> What's the plan?
<s> That's right.
<s> What?
<s> About 22 hours on site.
<s> Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
<s> It's not over.  You made one mistake.
<s> De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
<s> Colonel.
<s> I say we tape him to a chair.
<s> But now it's free, right?
<s> Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
<s> Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
<s> That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
<s> Well, there's nobody special!
<s> I never really...went through a... dating period.
<s> That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
<s> Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
<s> Why this is outrageous!...
<s> Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
<s> Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
<s> I was attacked.
<s> Two kids tried to set me on fire.
<s> ...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
<s> And who's Lydia?
<s> Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
<s> Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
<s> I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
<s> Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
<s> <u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
<s> Thanks.
<s> You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
<s> No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
<s> <u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
<s> Then what do you want to stay with me for?
<s> I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
<s> Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
<s> You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
<s> Uh... basement I think...
<s> Tragedy?
<s> Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
<s> Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
<s> You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
<s> Fine.
<s> Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
<s> Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
<s> Yes.  They're free.
<s> My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
<s> <u>What</u>!?
<s> I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
<s> Parry... I'm Jack.
<s> Funny -- you look married.
<s> Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
<s> Fifty dollars?
<s> You really want to help me?
<s> Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
<s> You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
<s> It's a classic.
<s> Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
<s> Who are you talking to Jack?
<s> What?
<s> I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
<s> I know!
<s> No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
<s> Listen, you're very nice... b...
<s> I leave it to you.
<s> Twinky?
<s> A wig?
<s> You said.
<s> I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
<s> That's right, hand.
<s> Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
<s> You're goin' a find me dead one time.
<s> You'll be gone, period.
<s> I don't, huh?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> How do you know it's clean?
<s> No. How much do I owe you?
<s> Am I on TV?
<s> Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
<s> Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
<s> I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
<s> There's nothing to say, Tita...
<s> Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
<s> I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
<s> Bye, Robert.
<s> What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
<s> What would I do with it? Run amok?
<s> Then after that?
<s> The day after tomorrow.
<s> I gave it a second thought.
<s> It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
<s> I don't think that's accurate...
<s> I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
<s> Shut up...
<s> No, the last time was three years ago.
<s> What?
<s> Is she?
<s> What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
<s> Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
<s> You're all full of shit!
<s> For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
<s> It's a Borzoi.
<s> It is true.
<s> I hope I didn't hear that.
<s> A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
<s> Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
<s> What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
<s> In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
<s> Steam.
<s> There's some good things on it, though.
<s> Well, she was.
<s> Just get the fuck outta here.
<s> Good. I'm faithful to them.
<s> I got punished, man.
<s> I won't let my motha cut my hair.
<s> She fucks it all up!
<s> I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
<s> If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
<s> 'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
<s> How old is he?
<s> You gonna talk to him?
<s> Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
<s> Yeah.
<s> A girl named Amanda.
<s> Positive.
<s> Jus' from around the way.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Unbelievable.
<s> Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
<s> You mean her.
<s> He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
<s> Fletch, this is dumb.
<s> What goddamn right do you have to take him?
<s> Not luck. They don't want me.
<s> I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
<s> It was planted on me, sir.
<s> Can I ask anybody now?
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> Thank God, the police.
<s> Go ahead. Make my evening.
<s> Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
<s> I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
<s> One. B-a-b-a-r.
<s> No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
<s> Your aunt?
<s> I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
<s> For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
<s> I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
<s> You don't have a piece of the action?
<s> Yes, right away.
<s> That's it?
<s> She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
<s> That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
<s> Wait a second --
<s> Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
<s> Yes. Where you from, Harry?
<s> You sure did.
<s> Fletch, I never sold nothing.
<s> I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
<s> Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
<s> Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
<s> Who?
<s> I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
<s> Sure.
<s> Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
<s> No problem, boss.
<s> Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
<s> Cute thing.
<s> John! You used to fly together!
<s> Hi.
<s> God...
<s> I saved his life during the war.
<s> Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
<s> Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
<s> He never sees them and I never met them.
<s> Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
<s> What does all this mean?
<s> Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
<s> I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
<s> If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
<s> I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
<s> I checked. There was no divorce.
<s> Don't tell me I can't --
<s> Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
<s> In her cabana, sir.
<s> Cabana one.
<s> Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
<s> Very good, sir.
<s> Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
<s> Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
<s> I'm her cousin.
<s> Uh, almost.
<s> Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
<s> You broke it? You know the source?
<s> Utah?
<s> You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
<s> What?  Who the hell are they?
<s> I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
<s> Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
<s> Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Who?
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
<s> Thanks, I needed that.
<s> I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
<s> I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
<s> Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
<s> Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
<s> Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
<s> Spooky.  I'll process her.
<s> No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
<s> Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
<s> Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
<s> C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
<s> You gave it to the girls for one.
<s> Why are all these people after me?
<s> You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
<s> No.  Who's Art Mooney?
<s> Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
<s> As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
<s> Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
<s> I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
<s> Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
<s> Did he just say what I think he said?
<s> Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
<s> Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
<s> Who's my real father, man?
<s> Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
<s> Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
<s> Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
<s> I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
<s> The case!
<s> Go on, another time, another place.
<s> Shock.
<s> Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<s> It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
<s> I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
<s> Ciao.
<s> I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
<s> What?
<s> Where do you want it?
<s> Takin' care o' business, honey.
<s> Fuck you, Santa Claus!
<s> Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
<s> Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
<s> I wasn't looking.
<s> Yes --
<s> Are you having trouble raising the half million?
<s> Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
<s> J'ai pas confiance en lui.
<s> What happens to the schedule?
<s> Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
<s> S'right.
<s> He got off on six.
<s> Names.
<s> I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
<s> Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
<s> How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
<s> Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
<s> Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
<s> We put him to bed for the night.
<s> Third time around.
<s> Whatta you got?
<s> This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
<s> Just for mistakes of parking?
<s> What is that old building?
<s> For garbage?
<s> Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
<s> Baltimore?
<s> Well, why not a little of the King?
<s> You alright?
<s> Sure.
<s> Luck, my ass.
<s> I think you know, Frank.
<s> No.  This isn't what you think.
<s> Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
<s> No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
<s> Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
<s> Queens, New York.
<s> Hello?
<s> Frank...Frank Sullivan.
<s> Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
<s> Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
<s> Nothing...I just spilled something.
<s> I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
<s> I think I'm losing you.
<s> October 12, 1969.
<s> Chief?!  Is that you?
<s> Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
<s> What, Johnny?  What is it?
<s> Something happened, something...
<s> It's Mom.
<s> Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
<s> Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
<s> You really wanna know?
<s> You there?
<s> John, he's got my driver's license.
<s> No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
<s> In my pocket.
<s> Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
<s> We did it, John.  We stopped him.
<s> No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
<s> The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
<s> Better.
<s> The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
<s> Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
<s> I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
<s> Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
<s> April 16...?  That means she was the first.
<s> I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
<s> Sounds good.
<s> Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
<s> Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
<s> A hot shot, huh?
<s> Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
<s> I'll think of something.
<s> I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
<s> What?
<s> This is all the exercise I need...
<s> Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
<s> Is that so bad?
<s> Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
<s> Did you stay here last night?
<s> The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
<s> I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
<s> Why don't you help us?
<s> May be please have the wallet.
<s> Just keep your eyes on the road.
<s> Stop the car!  Now!!
<s> Damn you, Shelly!
<s> Who's Horace?
<s> Alright, alright.
<s> Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
<s> Daddy, what is going on?
<s> Come and get it.
<s> Wait a minute. I just...
<s> Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
<s> No, he was real.  Like on TV.
<s> No more.
<s> I found it outside.
<s> Why?
<s> Are they grown-ups?
<s> Boy scouting.
<s> I've seen it.
<s> -- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
<s> -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
<s> The what?
<s> Do you have to ask?
<s> Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
<s> Maybe you should mind your own business.
<s> That's all right.  I was just...
<s> Her name's Stephanie.
<s> I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
<s> Until I hear the truth.
<s> Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
<s> She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
<s> No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
<s> Really?
<s> He bought you that?
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
<s> I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
<s> Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
<s> There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
<s> She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
<s> I packed it. Just for us.
<s> Where is she?
<s> That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
<s> She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
<s> I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
<s> He is not.
<s> I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
<s> Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
<s> Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
<s> We changed our minds.
<s> I want to go home. I want off this ship.
<s> Just radio for help, okay???
<s> Please, hurry...
<s> Where you're going, mister?
<s> I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
<s> Shut up, Elliot.
<s> Press a button and they give us money.
<s> I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
<s> Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
<s> I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
<s> Then you should carry a gun.
<s> No, we're not.
<s> He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
<s> About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
<s> Unbelievable.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Did you see the winning run score?
<s> This could be it.
<s> You know about Adele.
<s> I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
<s> The Red Sox
<s> The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
<s> Why do you need a radio?
<s> Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
<s> And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
<s> Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
<s> You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Everything.
<s> Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
<s> What's sexy?
<s> I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
<s> An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
<s> How prominent?
<s> I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
<s> That's always been my problem.
<s> Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
<s> It violates so many trusts.
<s> I'm glad we're having this talk.
<s> I'm at the door.
<s> It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
<s> Get yourself something to eat.
<s> Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
<s> The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
<s> But the son is suppose to stop crying.
<s> Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
<s> I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
<s> Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
<s> "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
<s> Matthew.
<s> I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
<s> When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
<s> You're out of bullets.
<s> Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
<s> But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
<s> I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
<s> I hear good things about the new play.
<s> Is what true?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Where are you going now?
<s> Someone waiting for you?
<s> He goes to the theater armed.
<s> I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
<s> Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
<s> The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> "I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
<s> No. That is what you get for distracting me.
<s> Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
<s> How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
<s> Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
<s> A -- a week.
<s> First spin. Let the others march for a time.
<s> That's when you take advantage.
<s> There is nothing I can give.
<s> Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
<s> Somehow I expected not.
<s> I congratulate them.
<s> Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
<s> Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
<s> He's "discovering" India.
<s> Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
<s> --I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
<s> Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
<s> It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
<s> Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
<s> Again?
<s> I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
<s> You had to be a right-hander.
<s> <i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
<s> They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
<s> He was still warm when they confirmed.
<s> You know I'm scared of heights.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I'm sure I could have.
<s> Good choice.
<s> Michael's.
<s> Not bad, Jerome.
<s> In case you get back before I do.
<s> I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
<s> They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
<s> I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
<s> Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
<s> Why not?
<s> They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
<s> No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
<s> Yes.
<s> Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
<s> You'll be next.
<s> Let's walk.
<s> It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
<s> You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
<s> That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
<s> Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
<s> --Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
<s> This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
<s> They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
<s> So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
<s> I bet.
<s> Small town, small bank, big money.
<s> Better than old times.
<s> Whisky and a peach.
<s> Just the way I remembered.
<s> No. It's been a long time.
<s> Really.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> He might be ready to chop us up.
<s> If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
<s> Do it my way.
<s> You sent me to him.
<s> She's on TV.
<s> And switched keys.
<s> Twenty eight hundred.
<s> I think so... I don't know.
<s> Sure...
<s> I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
<s> We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
<s> We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
<s> Oh, Jesus... how?
<s> Who was it?
<s> Yeah... I guess it does.
<s> Might try that.
<s> You were with him?
<s> What about the vault?
<s> Whatever you need.
<s> Just sandwiches...
<s> He took the day off.
<s> Can't leave the desk.
<s> Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
<s> Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
<s> Not now.
<s> And I keep my mouth shut?
<s> A Ford... We have a Ford.
<s> Can he trust you?
<s> That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
<s> I know.
<s> And you told Brumby?
<s> Nothing. What could I do?
<s> Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
<s> I know.
<s> Why?
<s> Christ, what...
<s> I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
<s> I can't.
<s> Yes.
<s> Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
<s> He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
<s> No.
<s> While he was here. You went about together?
<s> We're there now.
<s> Brumby.
<s> Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
<s> Now you're asking.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
<s> At me friend's house.
<s> Large Scotch.
<s> Good lad.
<s> Who's Brumby?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
<s> Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
<s> What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
<s> No.
<s> Jack Carter.
<s> No. I'm visiting relatives.
<s> It would be. If they were still living.
<s> A bereavement. A death in the family.
<s> That's all right, Eric.
<s> Still got a sense of humour?
<s> Still got your sense of humour.
<s> Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
<s> I have to. Things to see to.
<s> We've got to take you back to London.
<s> The gun he means.
<s> Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
<s> That's right.
<s> Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
<s> Shut up.
<s> ...Polacks...
<s> Where am I going to work?
<s> I...I don't know.
<s> It's too...
<s> Some contest board...
<s> I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
<s> Eh...?
<s> And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
<s> Nurses.
<s> What?
<s> When they...
<s> What?
<s> No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
<s> No, we're just...
<s> What will he pay?
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
<s> Then tough luck, George, because you are.
<s> That's right.
<s> Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
<s> Because you listened.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> That's...
<s> That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
<s> No.
<s> You think so?
<s> Where did Moss...?  I...
<s> Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
<s> Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
<s> In school.
<s> Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
<s> Get in the goddamn room.
<s> ...you didn't close...
<s> Roma.
<s> I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
<s> Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
<s> Murray said...
<s> ...apart from the top men on the contest board.
<s> And fifty bucks a lead.
<s> You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
<s> I can't split them.
<s> Because I say so.
<s> The deal still stands, our other thing.
<s> What?
<s> You're so full of shit.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Mmm.
<s> No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
<s> Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
<s> Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
<s> Last night, this morning.
<s> Mmm.
<s> Guess who?
<s> The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
<s> What is it?
<s> I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
<s> Sure.
<s> Kenilworth...?
<s> One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
<s> Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
<s> I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
<s> It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
<s> Three days.
<s> I told you.
<s> We're going to speak to her.
<s> She told me I have to.
<s> I don't have the power.  I said it.
<s> This.
<s> Fuck the Machine.
<s> I'm going home.
<s> And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
<s> With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
<s> The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
<s> I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
<s> If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
<s> Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
<s> She couldn't decide.
<s> You're not my father!
<s> Tom is right.
<s> Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
<s> I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
<s> No, Dad.
<s> Not for strangers; for my country.
<s> I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Forget it, just go take care of her.
<s> We're making an investment in Havana.
<s> Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
<s> I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
<s> It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
<s> You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
<s> What's that?
<s> Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
<s> And you believed that story.
<s> It's the way Pop wanted it.
<s> What?
<s> No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
<s> Why?
<s> Chi?
<s> How long does this go on?
<s> Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
<s> I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
<s> Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
<s> No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
<s> A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
<s> Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
<s> His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
<s> I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
<s> Twenty-five this time.
<s> He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
<s> Tom, what do I do now?
<s> You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
<s> Do you gamble?
<s> He is, I believe, a brother.
<s> In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
<s> Michael.
<s> Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
<s> It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
<s> Right here.
<s> Get out of my hotel.
<s> We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
<s> Yes.
<s> That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
<s> You were unfair with them.
<s> Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
<s> In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
<s> Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
<s> Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
<s> I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
<s> It's important.
<s> Maybe, yes... maybe no.
<s> That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
<s> How much more a month?
<s> Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
<s> Just thinking out loud.
<s> Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
<s> Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
<s> It never crossed your mind?
<s> Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
<s> If you enjoy it, you should do it.
<s> You mean us?
<s> You will not hurt him?
<s> A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
<s> No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
<s> No!
<s> He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
<s> Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
<s> Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
<s> No, I -- you're a homosexual.
<s> You don't think of me that way, do you?
<s> No.  I --
<s> What happened?
<s> Cut it out!
<s> Not me.
<s> Something happened to him?
<s> You asked me to model.  Remember?
<s> I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
<s> Clayton is fine.
<s> Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
<s> What happened?
<s> That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
<s> "A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
<s> What'd you say?
<s> What won't do?
<s> What did you expect?  Bronze?
<s> Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
<s> You'll feel better tomorrow.
<s> Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
<s> Have a drink?
<s> I just want to watch it, okay?
<s> She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
<s> It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
<s> I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
<s> You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
<s> Then who did?
<s> In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
<s> Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
<s> Yes?
<s> I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
<s> Go.
<s> I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
<s> No.  I expect you can't.
<s> A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
<s> Of course.
<s> Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
<s> I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
<s> Don't go away.
<s> Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
<s> What kind of job... ?
<s> Yes ... Kip ...
<s> I knew you'd say that.
<s> Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
<s> I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
<s> How is he?
<s> Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
<s> No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
<s> Keys were in it ...
<s> It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
<s> Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
<s> Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
<s> No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
<s> Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
<s> That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
<s> Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
<s> Dignity...
<s> Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
<s> You, too, Ma...
<s> How's Kip?
<s> Atley Jackson came to see me ...
<s> I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
<s> Mother -- !
<s> NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
<s> Oh, for God's sake
<s> Yes, sir -
<s> "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
<s> Don't go there, Toby --
<s> Yeah -
<s> Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
<s> About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
<s> Otto called -
<s> "Shadow games?"
<s> You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
<s> Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
<s> Price of doing business...
<s> Nah.
<s> What?
<s> I know. I've missed you, too
<s> I know ...
<s> Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
<s> Thought I'd go for a ride -
<s> Things are all leafy and suburban ...
<s> Now, we go -
<s> Where we going -- ?
<s> Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
<s> Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
<s> I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
<s> I always thought you'd follow me up.
<s> No. Open her ...
<s> A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
<s> You're going high-cheese, dude --
<s> "Unlock my button" ... ?
<s> I bet you say that to all the girls...
<s> What about The Club ... ?
<s> How is he -- ?
<s> Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
<s> If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
<s> His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
<s> Who's "Eleanor?"
<s> You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
<s> Not really -
<s> Shit all looks the same here --
<s> Look at Jeannie's kid.
<s> The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
<s> No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
<s> Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
<s> Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
<s> The guy from near where Christie used to live?
<s> Why would I get into that?
<s> Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
<s> I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
<s> He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
<s> What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
<s> It'll be okay.
<s> She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
<s> Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
<s> I got seared.
<s> I got scared.
<s> Yeah. What about the kids' school?
<s> Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
<s> Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
<s> What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
<s> Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
<s> Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
<s> Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
<s> Yeah, yeah.
<s> What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
<s> I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
<s> I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
<s> Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
<s> Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
<s> Oh shit.
<s> All right, then.
<s> What are we gonna do up there?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Next week.
<s> Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
<s> Week after I'm twenty-one.
<s> Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
<s> What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
<s> Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
<s> You don't know that.
<s> Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
<s> All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
<s> I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
<s> I'm Irish.
<s> You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
<s> Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
<s> You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
<s> Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
<s> History.
<s> Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
<s> That's one aspect of what we do.
<s> Seven.
<s> It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
<s> The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
<s> No students work for me.
<s> Hey fuck you.
<s> Of course.
<s> C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
<s> I don't know what it's called.
<s> I'm pretty sure it's right.
<s> Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
<s> I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
<s> Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
<s> I did.
<s> The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
<s> Since Nancy died.
<s> I got your card.
<s> I need someone with your kind of background.
<s> Just meet with the boy once a week.
<s> That would be fine.
<s> Tom.
<s> Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
<s> Who?
<s> Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
<s> --And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
<s> That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
<s> I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
<s> I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
<s> What's the point?
<s> Let's hit "Kelly's."
<s> Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
<s> You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
<s> What did you think?
<s> This is a real piece of shit.
<s> You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
<s> You've never been out of Boston.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
<s> Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
<s> You're kiddin' me.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
<s> If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
<s> You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
<s> I bet your parents were happy to pay.
<s> You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
<s> No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
<s> Not a chance.
<s> Your house must have been a zoo.
<s> I'm sorry, I been real busy.
<s> If you bring the caramels.
<s> I'm supposed to understand this.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> Come one Will. I just want to know.
<s> --But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
<s> How do you know that?
<s> What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
<s> You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
<s> Well, I'm contracting the land.
<s> But ain't no reason--
<s> I'll get Rosasharn.
<s> Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
<s> You're *ticklin' me!*
<s> Now I can't breathe.
<s> I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
<s> She got to make it.
<s> I guess that's what he looked like.
<s> Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
<s> Four.
<s> Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
<s> Why ain't they more like it?
<s> Crate fell on me.
<s> Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
<s> I dunno. Payin' five now.
<s> Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
<s> I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
<s> Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
<s> I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
<s> All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
<s> Ain't a-goin', thas all...
<s> Take her with you!
<s> I'll walk back.
<s> This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
<s> I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
<s> I'd a found you, Ma.
<s> Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
<s> Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
<s> No.
<s> Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
<s> Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
<s> Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
<s> I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
<s> I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
<s> Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
<s> Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
<s> You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
<s> How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
<s> Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
<s> Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
<s> I know that! But *where* they gone?
<s> But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
<s> Me an' you both.
<s> Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
<s> Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
<s> Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
<s> I never--
<s> Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
<s> Computer guy.
<s> What?
<s> Really...? So what?
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
<s> Overflowing with love.
<s> Yes.
<s> Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
<s> I'm a professional killer.
<s> Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
<s> That'd be good.
<s> Unbelievable.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
<s> What?
<s> Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
<s> Like heroin?
<s> Jesus Christ!
<s> I'll hide.
<s> Mmm.
<s> Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
<s> Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
<s> Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
<s> I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
<s> Excellent. Here they come.
<s> That sounds pretty interesting...
<s> It was the PLO.
<s> We can't do our job unless he does his job.
<s> Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
<s> -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
<s> If he does our job, he's our job.
<s> This?
<s> It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
<s> Good. What else? Anything interesting?
<s> That's wonderful, Mom.
<s> Jim?
<s> Nature made him then broke the mold.
<s> Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
<s> I have a headache. You have a headache?
<s> I think I'll go see Debi today.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Paul?
<s> Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
<s> That's good.
<s> Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
<s> Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
<s> Does Chicago count?
<s> It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
<s> You too.
<s> Need a lift?
<s> He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
<s> Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
<s> You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
<s> I am comfortable.
<s> What?!
<s> Why?
<s> Mom?
<s> Fine -- I'll take my bath.
<s> -- enough time tomorrow. I know.
<s> I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
<s> What?
<s> Don't they believe in signs here?
<s> You're right. Good.
<s> About what?
<s> FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
<s> I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
<s> That's not true.
<s> So do you.
<s> Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
<s> We're very lucky.
<s> I love you.
<s> No. I was just researching. Calm down.
<s> He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
<s> I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
<s> I know. We miss you too.
<s> Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
<s> Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
<s> Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
<s> No. He had the choice.
<s> It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
<s> Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
<s> Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
<s> Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
<s> Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
<s> Well, I am going to go after lunch.
<s> I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
<s> I understand, but Annie, please...
<s> Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
<s> Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
<s> What?
<s> You!
<s> No thanks.
<s> I don't think Warren would go for that.
<s> He thought it was a ghost.
<s> Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
<s> We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
<s> I know where he goes.
<s> So?
<s> Can I come? I'll start a fire...
<s> I just could never say it!
<s> Why don't we just cut through the woods?
<s> Maybe... look -- just...
<s> I want to see Pilgrim.
<s> I know. Amazing.
<s> YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
<s> You just showing off for her!
<s> I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
<s> Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Honey... I was always good.
<s> Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
<s> Dragon book. Compiler design.
<s> Shh!
<s> Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
<s> Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
<s> Go fix the phones.
<s> That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
<s> Yeah? Display?
<s> Dead?
<s> Mm-hmm.
<s> And unpack.
<s> You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
<s> This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
<s> Never heard of you. Done anything?
<s> How did you know that?
<s> What's this one eat?
<s> And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
<s> Okay. Let's go shopping.
<s> Yeah! Sure.
<s> Pool on the roof must have a leak.
<s> Are you challenging me?
<s> You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
<s> You're not gonna win.
<s> I didn't know what was on it.
<s> Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
<s> It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
<s> Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
<s> My name is the Plague.
<s> Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
<s> The rabbit is in the administration system.
<s> Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
<s> Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
<s> Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
<s> I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> So?
<s> Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
<s> Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
<s> All right.
<s> Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
<s> My parents baby-sitter canceled.
<s> This morning.
<s> My parents are going to come home early tonight.
<s> We've been better.
<s> Not without Jamie.
<s> She's not dead!
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Brady!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
<s> Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
<s> You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
<s> I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
<s> How do you know their not?
<s> I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
<s> About what?
<s> For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
<s> I can see this is useless.
<s> I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
<s> I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
<s> Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
<s> I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
<s> But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
<s> Double scoops?
<s> I can't.
<s> I've got you come on, go down.
<s> Dad, what's going on?
<s> Why?
<s> No problem, Sheriff.
<s> Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
<s> They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
<s> Car trouble?
<s> Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
<s> Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
<s> We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
<s> I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
<s> I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
<s> I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
<s> Bye.
<s> He can still watch.
<s> This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
<s> Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
<s> ...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
<s> I thought you were gonna get one for me.
<s> Lee Brackett.
<s> Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
<s> You all right?
<s> I found the car! He's here!
<s> I don't think so...
<s> Totally.
<s> Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
<s> I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
<s> After the Jack-O-Lantern.
<s> Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
<s> There was no one outside.
<s> And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
<s> Let's make more popcorn.
<s> There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
<s> He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
<s> He'll barely be able to sit up.
<s> I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
<s> Shouldn't we pick him up?
<s> Mm-mm!
<s> I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
<s> You want to see some?
<s> Well, let's do it.
<s> Look at this.
<s> A lot of works.
<s> No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
<s> Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
<s> This time I really think I have something.
<s> You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
<s> Let's take a look.
<s> Really?!
<s> The hospital?  What kind of tests?
<s> Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
<s> Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
<s> ...cannot go on the air.
<s> Oh, great.
<s> ...ex-husband on the street the other day.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
<s> Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Oh, that's nice.
<s> Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
<s> Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
<s> What are you doing?!
<s> What do you expect me to say?
<s> Not because of me, I hope.
<s> But not over me?
<s> I can't say anything!
<s> Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
<s> Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
<s> Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
<s> If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
<s> Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
<s> I care a great deal about him, yes.
<s> I know!  I know!
<s> Let's go have dinner, shall we?
<s> Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
<s> Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
<s> No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
<s> It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
<s> You're not lost.
<s> We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
<s> It's on the table, Dad.
<s> That thought doesn't terrify you?
<s> Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
<s> Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
<s> Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
<s> Yeah.
<s> I can't take this anymore.
<s> I'm saying it now!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Jesus...Jesus!
<s> You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
<s> I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
<s> No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
<s> Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
<s> A week ago, I bought a rifle.
<s> I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
<s> I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
<s> Doesn't she look pretty?
<s> Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
<s> Why?
<s> You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
<s> Really?
<s> Here, you guys.  Open them up.
<s> I think he'll find that satisfying.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
<s> ...you know?  I, uh...
<s> Thanks, thanks.
<s> That's a beauty!
<s> Football!
<s> Is there no chance?
<s> Well, then a third opinion.
<s> W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
<s> Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, your kids are so adorable.
<s> He's not a loser at all!
<s> Here.  Be careful with those.
<s> Oh!
<s> Well, how about this?
<s> Oh?
<s> Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
<s> No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
<s> I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
<s> Look, everything's going your way.
<s> But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
<s> Yeah, that's clerical.
<s> I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
<s> Hmm!
<s> It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
<s> Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
<s> And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
<s> Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
<s> How are you?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well, I hope you've changed.
<s> Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
<s> Oh, nothing much.  You know...
<s> Probably not.
<s> No, well...I've been trying to write.
<s> You've always hated my taste in the past.
<s> You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
<s> Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
<s> I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
<s> Oh, yeah?  What?
<s> Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Just a few minutes ago.
<s> Mmm, what?
<s> Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
<s> ...which I did not get.
<s> You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
<s> Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
<s> I hereby acknowledge that...
<s> ...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
<s> Or, perhaps...
<s> It's a growth business.

<s> About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
<s> I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
<s> It's been known to happen.
<s> Not now, Wendy.
<s> Shoot.
<s> All right.
<s> Because you're an idiot.
<s> Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
<s> Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
<s> I'll think about it.
<s> I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
<s> Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
<s> Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
<s> We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
<s> Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
<s> You goddamn bitch!
<s> Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
<s> Very very. The photographs?
<s> Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
<s> Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
<s> People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
<s> Don't talk to me like that.
<s> God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
<s> Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
<s> How very.
<s> I don't really like your friends either.
<s> Maybe it's time for a vacation.
<s> Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
<s> Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
<s> Like a suicide thing?
<s> "I die knowing no one knew the real me."
<s> My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
<s> Oh.
<s> You must have had fun.
<s> Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
<s> Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
<s> Did not.
<s> Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
<s> You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
<s> Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
<s> I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
<s> Goddamn Geek!
<s> Punch it in!
<s> I guess.
<s> Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
<s> Get a job.
<s> That's three things.
<s> playfully shoves his hand away.
<s> Look who I've found!
<s> I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
<s> breaks down into heavy sobs.
<s> You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
<s> From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
<s> It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
<s> You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
<s> That's enough, Yvonne!
<s> gives her a sympathetic look.
<s> Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
<s> I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
<s> Saint Mario!
<s> You're such an incredible woman.
<s> What??
<s> That idiot boarder?
<s> They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
<s> That was what we were led to believe . . .
<s> Mummy!
<s> Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
<s> Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
<s> Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
<s> Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
<s> Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
<s> What?
<s> Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
<s> Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
<s> I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
<s> Allison Dormere. Your intern.
<s> What's the difference?
<s> Zero's a number right?
<s> Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
<s> Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
<s> In a word? Lucrative.
<s> There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
<s> Really, why's that?
<s> It's perfect.
<s> I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
<s> Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
<s> This game is over do you hear me?
<s> What things do you think you've done?
<s> Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
<s> Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
<s> I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
<s> Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
<s> In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
<s> They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
<s> LaPlante!
<s> I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
<s> I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
<s> Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
<s> What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
<s> I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
<s> It was you!  I thought I heard...
<s> I got your bail continued.
<s> We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
<s> I understand.  How often do you see your son?
<s> It's November.
<s> You mean John Bubber?
<s> When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
<s> I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
<s> You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
<s> You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
<s> Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
<s> Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
<s> Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
<s> Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
<s> He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
<s> A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
<s> You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
<s> You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
<s> Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
<s> What picture?
<s> Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
<s> Uh, no.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
<s> John, I know all about it.
<s> Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
<s> The...Silver...Mike...Award!
<s> "For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
<s> The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
<s> You said all the passengers were accounted for...
<s> He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
<s> If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
<s> Quit?  She wants to quit?
<s> Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
<s> What's "cynical"?
<s> You didn't?
<s> Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
<s> Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
<s> How are they with kids?
<s> So this really does the trick, eh?
<s> Well, it's for a woman.
<s> Right.
<s> Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
<s> Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
<s> Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
<s> That would be stupid.
<s> You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
<s> I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
<s> There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
<s> Sure.
<s> Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
<s> Uh huh.
<s> I'm thirsty.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
<s> No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
<s> I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
<s> The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
<s> Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
<s> Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
<s> High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
<s> It's a nice pool, isn't it?
<s> Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
<s> What?
<s> Huh?
<s> There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
<s> Oh baby.
<s> Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
<s> Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
<s> There's always an excuse, isn't there?
<s> Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
<s> Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
<s> Two -- three if you count the husband.
<s> Do you have enough money?
<s> And I can't help having a cold.
<s> Get on the other side of that.
<s> Promise.
<s> Would you?
<s> Talk to me about what?
<s> Yeah -- how'd you know that?
<s> I think it was England.
<s> So?
<s> No.
<s> Is that it?
<s> Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
<s> That is what bothers me.
<s> And what do you think you will find in another land?
<s> For what?
<s> We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
<s> She's the King's cousin.
<s> That doesn't matter.
<s> She's a treasure she is.
<s> It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
<s> I lied.
<s> Where I'm going you cannot follow.
<s> What are you hoping to find inside?
<s> A lucky guess.
<s> I'll be fine.
<s> Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
<s> A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
<s> --for three hundred years.
<s> Not unless they're immortal.
<s> Get out.
<s> Why?
<s> And this?
<s> I like my work.
<s> It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
<s> Why did you wait?
<s> My dreams died long ago.
<s> Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
<s> I understand.
<s> He knows better than that.
<s> It's happening right now.
<s> She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
<s> I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
<s> I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
<s> Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
<s> Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
<s> For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
<s> Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
<s> How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
<s> You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
<s> I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
<s> We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
<s> The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
<s> Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
<s> Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
<s> Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<s> Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
<s> I got the gasoline --
<s> Dennis.
<s> Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
<s> You'd better be kidding.
<s> We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
<s> You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
<s> Shh, they'll hear you!
<s> Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
<s> Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
<s> All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
<s> Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
<s> What are you doing?!  Stop that!
<s> Just one question.  Please.
<s> What's that, Chief?  Say again.
<s> Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
<s> Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
<s> Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
<s> Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
<s> Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
<s> Go, Mickey.
<s> Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
<s> Chief, it's Mikkelson.
<s> Are all of you named Jones?
<s> How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
<s> Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
<s> We're okay.
<s> I thought they locked you in your room.
<s> You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
<s> These disks . . . where are they?
<s> Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<s> Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
<s> I'm sorry, it's a private function.
<s> They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
<s> We, who is we?
<s> Where is your family?
<s> Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
<s> You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
<s> No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
<s> Yes we have.
<s> Canadian Club?
<s> We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
<s> Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
<s> That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
<s> The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
<s> The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
<s> What did they say?
<s> Watch everything? How? They are gone.
<s> The front gate would be best, General.
<s> I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
<s> Get in.
<s> If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
<s> I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
<s> Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
<s> Why not? We are half way there already.
<s> Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
<s> Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
<s> Yes, sir. What is wrong?
<s> Why sir?
<s> He will be here.
<s> I will see what I can do.
<s> Pack the bags, we have to move.
<s> What?
<s> Please, be quiet.
<s> No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
<s> No, Odette says he's in shock.
<s> No. They are not dead. Stop this.
<s> What about us?
<s> But who is left?
<s> Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
<s> In Ruhengeri?
<s> There is one thing I need right away.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
<s> How dead?
<s> The lieutenant wants the register.
<s> Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
<s> It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
<s> Please, papa, I have a secret path.
<s> -- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
<s> I'm moved beyond words.
<s> Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
<s> -- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
<s> No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
<s> Ms. Marr!
<s> As a tumor.
<s> I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
<s> I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
<s> The...Fourth of July.
<s> Up here --
<s> Over here!
<s> I thought she was dead. For sure.
<s> I don't think so...
<s> -- listen to the man --
<s> He's gotta still be down here.
<s> -- was that??
<s> Jesus!
<s> How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
<s> Asking the wrong person again.
<s> Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
<s> -- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
<s> No, no, it's just --
<s> Maybe if I --
<s> Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
<s> I am.
<s> -- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
<s> -- no more --
<s> Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
<s> No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
<s> Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
<s> I can't comment until I get paid.
<s> Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
<s> I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
<s> Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
<s> He would have been back by now.
<s> Melissa...?
<s> Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
<s> What's the matter?
<s> I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
<s> There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
<s> Yes.  It was.
<s> No!
<s> A few years older, perhaps.
<s> Good-bye.
<s> She's down...how do you mean honey?
<s> Ok...
<s> Take me to her.
<s> Sure.  Did you see the others?
<s> That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
<s> Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
<s> Daddy help!
<s> Good night daddy.
<s> Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
<s> Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
<s> I just, I don't know...
<s> Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
<s> Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
<s> You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
<s> Should I...
<s> Know what?
<s> I'm ok.
<s> Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
<s> We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
<s> Oh, that's nice...
<s> Did you remove anything in the cellar!
<s> What are you getting at!
<s> It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
<s> I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
<s> Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
<s> What?
<s> No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
<s> OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
<s> Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
<s> And what is ... this frozen moment?
<s> It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
<s> Taken what?
<s> No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
<s> Who's that?
<s> Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
<s> Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
<s> No.  We want ...
<s> No.  Really?
<s> Wow.  Thank you.
<s> And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
<s> But how in God's name ...
<s> It has already begun.
<s> That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
<s> Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
<s> No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
<s> It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
<s> Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
<s> Gum.
<s> Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
<s> Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
<s> Rutherford Auction... that name...
<s> Why try?
<s> Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
<s> Don't worry, we'll get it...
<s> Let's just forget it, I mean...
<s> I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
<s> Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
<s> Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
<s> Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
<s> Prison?
<s> Uh....old badminton injury.
<s> You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
<s> It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
<s> Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
<s> Baseball, why?
<s> Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
<s> Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
<s> You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
<s> Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
<s> You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
<s> Why George, you big softie...
<s> They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
<s> The Hudsucker Hoop!
<s> Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
<s> I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
<s> Well, maybe I --
<s> Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
<s> I know they're gonna buy that stock --
<s> But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
<s> I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
<s> I myself --
<s> No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
<s> Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
<s> ...I'm sorry.
<s> Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
<s> You know, on farm route 17.
<s> Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
<s> What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
<s> Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
<s> Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
<s> Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
<s> Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
<s> Now, Aim --
<s> Worked in a watch factory?
<s> Norville!
<s> Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
<s> Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
<s> He grins wolfishly.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> I'm sure you do.
<s> What the heck they doin'?
<s> ...Geez.
<s> I --
<s> We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
<s> Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
<s> That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
<s> Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
<s> Oh my God, sir!
<s> Oh my God, sir!
<s> Lobby. We haven't got all day.
<s> Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
<s> Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
<s> Yeah, tell me about it.
<s> Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
<s> I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
<s> Ti-Misery?  What's that?
<s> Alive?
<s> You mean a figurehead.
<s> But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
<s> Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
<s> Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
<s> I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
<s> You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
<s> It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
<s> I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
<s> I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
<s> A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
<s> Yes -- on the boat.
<s> I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
<s> It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
<s> Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
<s> Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
<s> Of course, Wes.
<s> Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
<s> You can't really believe that.
<s> A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
<s> I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
<s> If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
<s> But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
<s> She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
<s> And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
<s> No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
<s> I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
<s> It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
<s> Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
<s> It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
<s> Why?
<s> Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
<s> Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
<s> And as usual no one believed me...
<s> I wasn't star--
<s> I do. I'm -- are you...?
<s> That shirt?
<s> Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
<s> Stuffed and baking.
<s> Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
<s> So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
<s> Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
<s> I'm not.
<s> Elena.
<s> Ben.
<s> Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
<s> Paul? Yeah. You think --
<s> All right.
<s> Fine.
<s> Hnnn.
<s> Sure dad.
<s> After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Jesus all right enough!
<s> Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
<s> I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
<s> C'mon.
<s> And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
<s> -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
<s> Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
<s> What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
<s> Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
<s> Well, we can talk about it.
<s> Yeah. You?
<s> Nobody.
<s> You're not a psycho!
<s> Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
<s> Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
<s> It'll warm you up.
<s> You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Forget how to ride a bike.
<s> You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
<s> That's right.
<s> Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
<s> Am I right or am I right?
<s> My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
<s> Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
<s> Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
<s> You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
<s> You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
<s> Who said so?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Out.
<s> Maybe we can just watch some TV.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Watching what?
<s> Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
<s> Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
<s> Can I come?
<s> The ones you built?
<s> If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
<s> Vodka?
<s> Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
<s> Don't worry about him...
<s> Twelve years younger.
<s> Where is he?
<s> No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
<s> I told her to come.
<s> First I need a copy of the key.
<s> To do nothing.
<s> Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
<s> Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
<s> Habit.
<s> Huh?
<s> Good to see you, too, Randy.
<s> You're not missing much.
<s> You don't know.
<s> Who?
<s> Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
<s> Did you have sex with her?
<s> Yes.
<s> I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
<s> There's nothing more to talk about.
<s> Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
<s> Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
<s> Are you the leader of tis group?
<s> You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
<s> He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
<s> Your lover.
<s> It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
<s> I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
<s> What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
<s> Stop her Louis!
<s> I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
<s> What have you done?
<s> The way I learn everything. By watching you.
<s> The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
<s> Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Still my beautiful child.
<s> It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
<s> Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
<s> They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
<s> What danger?
<s> I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
<s> I can't go through with it, I tell you.
<s> But why do you want me?
<s> Yes...
<s> You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
<s> And if I don't?
<s> Paris? You came from Paris?
<s> What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
<s> Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
<s> And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
<s> I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
<s> NO!!!
<s> Lestat, what do you mean?
<s> That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
<s> CLAUDIA!!!
<s> You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
<s> We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
<s> You're not lying to me, are you?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, that rumour about crosses?
<s> The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
<s> How could I not? She had to know.
<s> Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
<s> He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
<s> But it has. There is no more to tell.
<s> It's over, I'm telling you...
<s> Checking in...Karla Wilson.
<s> Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
<s> Phones went down a few minutes ago.
<s> What are you doing in my closet?
<s> No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
<s> Yeah, right -- whatever.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
<s> I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
<s> Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
<s> This weekend?
<s> Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
<s> It's gonna be great.
<s> Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
<s> I don't know.
<s> To get out of Southport?
<s> It beets being on the mainland.
<s> He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
<s> Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
<s> Did you get help?
<s> Honey, some folks just can't fly.
<s> Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
<s> Hey --
<s> We gotta get out of here. Now.
<s> Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
<s> He's probably the only one who can help us.
<s> Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
<s> How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
<s> Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
<s> Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
<s> I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
<s> Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
<s> No. I shot him.
<s> The rest of us see bathrobes.
<s> And so could you -- crazy fool.
<s> So why are you still here?
<s> Drunk again?
<s> Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
<s> He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
<s> May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
<s> This was once a cemetery.
<s> All the graves?
<s> I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
<s> She has never mentioned her family.
<s> How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
<s> I do not know him, but I have seen him.
<s> But one must love a father.
<s> Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
<s> I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
<s> There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
<s> Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
<s> You are my friend.
<s> Listen to what I say --
<s> Are you running a business or a charity ward?
<s> So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
<s> I hate to do this, fella.
<s> Don't . . . George?
<s> Carter –– bank examiner.
<s> I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
<s> Made what?
<s> There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
<s> Zuzu's petals.
<s> That's your problem, George Bailey.
<s> George Bailey.
<s> That's the kid.
<s> That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
<s> Yes, but George . . .
<s> You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
<s> What's that book you've got there?
<s> All right.
<s> Want to give my flower a drink.
<s> Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
<s> Hee-haw!
<s> And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
<s> No, sir.
<s> No.
<s> Yes –– charge.
<s> Hope you enjoy it.
<s> What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
<s> Still after that first million before you're thirty.
<s> Oh, yeah, yeah.
<s> Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
<s> Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
<s> Huh?
<s> What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
<s> No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
<s> Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
<s> George . . .
<s> I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
<s> Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
<s> Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
<s> I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
<s> What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
<s> I'll take chocolate.
<s> Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
<s> Beautiful.
<s> Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
<s> Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
<s> Have you made up your mind?
<s> About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
<s> Didn't you tell her?
<s> Mary . . .
<s> Hi.
<s> My baby.
<s> Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
<s> George, darling! Where have you been?
<s> I don't care. It's George's tux.
<s> What plates?
<s> Is she responsible for the punch?
<s> I hope that's the cousin.
<s> Listen to Andy, Sean.
<s> Let's just go sailing, okay?
<s> It's still there!
<s> If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
<s> Right.
<s> Never mind that shit.  Just point.
<s> You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Sean's still out there.
<s> Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
<s> Did you get any pictures?
<s> Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
<s> Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
<s> We don't know that, do we?
<s> I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
<s> Is there one in these waters?
<s> Home it is.
<s> Better yet.
<s> For me?
<s> It was bad, wasn't it.
<s> That's great.
<s> Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
<s> It's still a good idea.
<s> Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
<s> That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
<s> Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
<s> Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
<s> Now I really want to see it.
<s> Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
<s> Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
<s> Great.
<s> Great.
<s> Nope.
<s> What's that mean?
<s> Nope.
<s> I dunno.  We'll think of something.
<s> What Kids?  Who went out?
<s> Mike?  Our Mike?
<s> I'm going.
<s> Until we find something.
<s> It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
<s> I can go out if I want to.
<s> If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
<s> When are we going out?  You and me?
<s> You going with Patrick?
<s> Coming about, then.
<s> Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
<s> Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
<s> See you later.
<s> Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
<s> He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
<s> We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
<s> That's a lot of ground to cover.
<s> ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
<s> Michael, the sub's dead.
<s> I talked you into this?
<s> It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
<s> I know I can capture it.
<s> No.
<s> No, you're not.
<s> I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
<s> It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
<s> That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
<s> This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
<s> I don't understand.
<s> You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
<s> ... Okay.
<s> I'm  fine.
<s> Fine.  Have them do some.
<s> Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
<s> It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
<s> Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
<s> Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
<s> Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
<s> The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
<s> Ten minutes ago.
<s> Better than catching Sean's herpes.
<s> Massachussettans aren't.
<s> ... Massachussettans aren't.
<s> Are you really?
<s> Come on!  Check this out!
<s> Why you sonuvabitch...
<s> What, hon?
<s> It's okay, Sean.
<s> Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
<s> Remember, skiers stay up longer.
<s> Don't you dare.
<s> What?
<s> Calvin said it was all right.
<s> What the hell's there?
<s> How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
<s> Right, Mike.
<s> ... I'll go to McDonalds.
<s> Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
<s> Who's grown up?
<s> Something wrong?
<s> It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
<s> This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
<s> It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
<s> We're in love.
<s> Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
<s> But you always let me....
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> No way....
<s> My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
<s> We need milk....
<s> I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
<s> I don't know...You...I don't know.
<s> They're at the beach....
<s> But it went away...We would have known....
<s> She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
<s> You caught me....
<s> Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
<s> Spent it all on beer....
<s> What difference does it make?  It's here....
<s> We'll divert it...We'll do something....
<s> I won't....
<s> What's going on?
<s> You can stay in my room.
<s> I'm just getting started....
<s> Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
<s> It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
<s> Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
<s> Okay.
<s> I am.
<s> Good.
<s> There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
<s> Doesn't matter....
<s> Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
<s> How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
<s> Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
<s> Still chasing fish?
<s> I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
<s> A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
<s> Where the hell's the beer...?
<s> Stop busting my hump....
<s> Holy shit!
<s> When we got the grant....
<s> We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
<s> So did I....
<s> Lots of times....
<s> How long has he been here...?
<s> Hoagie.
<s> I live to hear the sound...You all right?
<s> 'Snuck up on me....'
<s> Mom....
<s> My equipment doesn't crap out....
<s> No way....
<s> I'm the one who wanted to study it....
<s> I just want to make an honest woman of you....
<s> I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
<s> We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
<s> Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
<s> What?
<s> No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
<s> Is it your vehicle?
<s> I hope I'm not intruding?
<s> Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
<s> I think you're here all day.
<s> Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
<s> Maybe?
<s> O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
<s> Then give me that Zippo.
<s> I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
<s> You want me to stop the car?
<s> How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
<s> Listen to me saying what?
<s> He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
<s> I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
<s> Just makes to so God damned mad ..
<s> You don't really believe this?
<s> I'm asking it.
<s> <u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
<s> Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
<s> Are you sure you didn't call?
<s> I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
<s> I'm going up to the institute.
<s> This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
<s> That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
<s> Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
<s> And did they?
<s> I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
<s> My hands?
<s> No.
<s> No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
<s> I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
<s> It was probably the wind.
<s> Which is what?
<s> I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<s> I wanna be near you ...
<s> The man from the F.B.I.
<s> C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
<s> Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
<s> Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
<s> Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
<s> I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
<s> Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
<s> I'm already walking. Where is it?
<s> I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
<s> Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
<s> Look, I don't want a --
<s> -- stop --
<s> There is something missing here.
<s> No.
<s> You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
<s> Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
<s> My son... my mind...
<s> I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
<s> Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
<s> Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
<s> Well, I'm happy for you.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah, thanks.
<s> No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
<s> Good evening.
<s> Oh good.
<s> Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
<s> Right.  I'll come in.
<s> Fine, I just --
<s> Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
<s> Why do you love me?
<s> Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
<s> You want...
<s> Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
<s> Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
<s> Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
<s> But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
<s> That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
<s> -- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
<s> It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
<s> I'll give it everything.
<s> Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
<s> So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
<s> We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
<s> Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
<s> Very much.
<s> Huh?
<s> Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
<s> Why not?
<s> Uh, not today, but --
<s> That's your word?
<s> Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
<s> No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
<s> Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
<s> Hey, that's my word, okay?
<s> Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
<s> Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
<s> We still having dinner in L.A.?
<s> Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
<s> I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
<s> I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
<s> I'm scared.  What is it?
<s> What is it?
<s> It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
<s> We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
<s> We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
<s> Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
<s> So do you.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No, it's...
<s> I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
<s> You couldn't have made that jump.
<s> Here!
<s> He's not a kill, he's still alive.
<s> What about Eric?
<s> DAD!
<s> Just hold on.
<s> I thought you were an expert.
<s> It won't hold!
<s> It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
<s> The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
<s> Baryonyx?
<s> Raptors, mostly.
<s> Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
<s> Then we go home?
<s> But then you never get to go in space.
<s> No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
<s> Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
<s> This plane can not land!
<s> I have never been on this island!
<s> Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
<s> Back out! Move!
<s> If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
<s> No.  I feel something.
<s> Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
<s> It doesn't matter what I think.
<s> Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
<s> Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
<s> It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
<s> Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
<s> You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
<s> I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
<s> That was about a year ago.
<s> No.  Richard talked to his parents.
<s> Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
<s> Okay.
<s> Piss.
<s> Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
<s> She's nuts.
<s> You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
<s> It has a broken leg!
<s> We're sure as hell not going back out there"
<s> It'll hold!
<s> I have to find Kelly!
<s> Four, counting the one in the chamber.
<s> That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
<s> Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
<s> Funded by whom?
<s> It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
<s> They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
<s> What?
<s> Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
<s> That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
<s> We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
<s> What now?
<s> I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
<s> I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
<s> Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
<s> I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
<s> These are dilated.  Take a look.
<s> We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
<s> Why?
<s> Small versions of adults, honey.
<s> What kind of park is it?
<s> They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
<s> Say again?
<s> Dilophosaurus.
<s> It's my favorite.
<s> - - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
<s> I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
<s> The fences are electrified, right?
<s> Like hell it is!
<s> It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
<s> - - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
<s> And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
<s> Please - - chance it.
<s> Hola, bienvenido
<s> He sends his apologies.
<s> What are we looking for?
<s> Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
<s> Oh, yeah - - great.
<s> Really?
<s> Yes it is.
<s> That's a good idea.
<s> "Thunder lizard!"
<s> Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
<s> You have no idea.
<s> You're sure?!
<s> For today, I guarantee it.
<s> What kind of opinions?
<s> Wu?
<s> Oh, I hate the other kind.
<s> All night.
<s> You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
<s> I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
<s> I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
<s> I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
<s> Excellent.
<s> Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
<s> Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
<s> You have a map.
<s> Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
<s> What about that other guy?
<s> Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
<s> You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
<s> Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
<s> He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
<s> Video store?
<s> This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
<s> A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
<s> Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
<s> Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
<s> That's open to debate.
<s> Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
<s> A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
<s> Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
<s> I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
<s> And if he's not?
<s> About ten minutes.
<s> Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
<s> I don't know what you could have read.
<s> -- In what sense?
<s> Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
<s> There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
<s> Then its authority is in doubt.
<s> Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
<s> Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
<s> ... My ... social situation?
<s> Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
<s> I do.
<s> I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
<s> Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
<s> I know.
<s> Why would you suppose so?
<s> Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
<s> What of it?
<s> He was murdered.
<s> I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
<s> I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
<s> Wednesday.  We left the office together.
<s> Well -- other departments are, yes.
<s> What makes you think so?
<s> What did she say?
<s> You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
<s> I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
<s> It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
<s> Then why haven't I been --
<s> Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
<s> ... A piece of paper ...
<s> It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
<s> "Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
<s> Lying in the gutter where they belong.
<s> On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
<s> He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
<s> Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
<s> Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
<s> And we're upset too.
<s> They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
<s> Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
<s> Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
<s> All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
<s> I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
<s> You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
<s> Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
<s> I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
<s> It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
<s> Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
<s> I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
<s> ) They are now.
<s> What?
<s> Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
<s> Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
<s> No.
<s> Look -- could I use your phone?
<s> Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
<s> Well we're pretty --
<s> Like for you to look for the man.
<s> Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
<s> He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
<s> You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
<s> No, I'm look --
<s> Could I ask some questions?
<s> Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
<s> Most of them.
<s> How would I remember?
<s> No thanks.
<s> Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
<s> It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
<s> It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
<s> You said you wanted these.
<s> I don't see anything, do you?
<s> And I don't think that was Tom.
<s> Well --
<s> When?
<s> Arlyn Page.
<s> Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
<s> -- Then you don't need me.
<s> Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
<s> You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
<s> I was wondering what that was.
<s> Drop it.
<s> Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
<s> I am.
<s> I better keep looking.
<s> It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
<s> No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
<s> Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
<s> Someone's been doing all these things.
<s> Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
<s> It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
<s> It's not so bad.
<s> All right.
<s> Goodbye, Pete.
<s> Has she talked with you since prison?
<s> You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
<s> Detroit.
<s> What about your mommy?
<s> Do you like to be with your mommy?
<s> Welcome to the... 
<s> On earth.
<s> That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
<s> Right.  One O.J. coming up.
<s> You got a letter from mom.
<s> I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
<s> Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
<s> Mom, I mean dad?
<s> That's okay.
<s> I hate it.
<s> I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
<s> No!
<s> It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
<s> Sure.  Lots of times.
<s> I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
<s> No.
<s> Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
<s> Why does he decide?
<s> I don't understand, daddy.
<s> Where will my toys be?
<s> Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
<s> Yes, your honor.
<s> Does the witness deny the injury took place?
<s> Six years.
<s> No, I did not.
<s> I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
<s> Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
<s> Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
<s> Objection!
<s> Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
<s> Eight, almost nine years.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I...I don't know...
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
<s> I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
<s> What?
<s> You've been living here, in the city?
<s> Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
<s> Joanna, what the hell is--
<s> What?
<s> No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
<s> Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
<s> You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
<s> Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
<s> Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
<s> Are you firing me, Jim?
<s> He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
<s> I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> Right.
<s> I'm going to take it.
<s> I know....I know.
<s> No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
<s> Do you want the kid or don't you?
<s> The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
<s> We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
<s> It's going to cost.
<s> Look, Ted, all I--
<s> What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
<s> No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
<s> Three.  And add some basil.
<s> Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
<s> Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
<s> Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
<s> Yes, Holiness.
<s> Kham, Holiness.
<s> Khambas are wild men.
<s> I know.
<s> Will you buy the sheep for me?
<s> No!
<s> You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
<s> Are you, General?
<s> It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
<s> I will not approve it.
<s> General Chiang.
<s> Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
<s> If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
<s> He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
<s> I miss my brother.
<s> We do not know.
<s> You could buy them.
<s> Look here!
<s> So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
<s> And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
<s> Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
<s> I had relinquished doubt.
<s> Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
<s> Good day.
<s> I leave tomorrow.
<s> You decide.
<s> Does he have the spot?
<s> Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
<s> Is that true or pretend?
<s> I would not know. Maybe.
<s> And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
<s> I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
<s> We cannot.
<s> Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
<s> No.  Do you?
<s> We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
<s> It happens when I land.
<s> I need to see his habitat.
<s> <u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
<s> I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
<s> They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
<s> Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
<s> And you like me.
<s> I coulda shot you, you--
<s> No crocodile has ever--
<s> Then do it!!
<s> So profound and fat.
<s> I don't know!
<s> Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
<s> Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
<s> Tranq guns down, rifles up!
<s> You talk to Bickerman?
<s> I never had sex with you!
<s> Are you sure?
<s> No.
<s> You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
<s> Guess I finally got bit.
<s> <u>Something's</u> in that water.
<s> In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
<s> Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
<s> Ssssh!
<s> Maybe.  Don't mush it.
<s> <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
<s> Good idea.
<s> Well...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
<s> White perch.
<s> So does he.
<s> Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
<s> You talk to the married couple?
<s> Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
<s> I got nothing against--
<s> Was he swallowed?
<s> You threw it at me!!
<s> I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
<s> He said he knew Karate!
<s> I guess.
<s> The somebody else part?
<s> It's ten after nine.
<s> Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
<s> Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
<s> Part of our research--
<s> Wild guess.
<s> Kevin told me you were upset.
<s> Backstabber?
<s> Shitbutt?
<s> Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
<s> Thanks, Ardelia.
<s> Why does she keep repeating the name?
<s> Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
<s> 'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
<s> Agent Mapp! Thank you!
<s> Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
<s> I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
<s> How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
<s> Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
<s> Starling -
<s> The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
<s> I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
<s> You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
<s> Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
<s> It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
<s> Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
<s> But if he knew we have so little time -
<s> Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
<s> Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
<s> Sewing...
<s> Not lately. But maybe someday.
<s> They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
<s> We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
<s> Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
<s> How many women has he used, our Bill?
<s> Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
<s> Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
<s> You're a tough one, aren't you?
<s> A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
<s> Why? Do you know something about him?
<s> Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
<s> I never thought about it.
<s> Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
<s> Big through the hips. Roomy.
<s> A cattle ranch?
<s> Yes, Doctor. Please.
<s> First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
<s> Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
<s> No. We just -
<s> What was it?
<s> Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
<s> No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
<s> You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
<s> I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
<s> Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
<s> How did you learn English?
<s> Sorry to disappoint you...
<s> Alice?
<s> Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
<s> There was no letter.
<s> Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
<s> You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
<s> What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
<s> We were headed...
<s> Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
<s> No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
<s> No.
<s> I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
<s> We don't.
<s> This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
<s> You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
<s> Your enemy...
<s> Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
<s> A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
<s> What else?
<s> Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
<s> Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
<s> Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
<s> You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
<s> General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
<s> Sir!
<s> Fire!
<s> I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
<s> "Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
<s> Gifts?
<s> This interview's over! The militia stays!
<s> Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
<s> Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
<s> Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
<s> And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
<s> It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
<s> No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
<s> Intelligence may not be the right word...
<s> Crunch...Implosion.
<s> No.
<s> Fuck your orders!
<s> I got hung up!  Try this!
<s> Shit...
<s> There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
<s> Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
<s> You screw around like that again and--
<s> Why can't we pick up his signal?
<s> After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
<s> Has it helped?
<s> The escape bubbles?
<s> Seeing how my stock's doing...
<s> Can't we fix it?
<s> You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
<s> ...I'd really have to show it to you.
<s> Roger.
<s> Ahhhh!
<s> Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
<s> Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
<s> I realize you must have gone through hell--
<s> I signed-up for the stock option.
<s> Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
<s> Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
<s> Itches like hell.
<s> What music?  There ain't no music.
<s> Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
<s> This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
<s> I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
<s> He's tanking on us...
<s> I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
<s> I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
<s> What are you going to do to him?
<s> I don't know.  I'm guessing.
<s> Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
<s> Oh man, that's just great...
<s> The good doctor signed our death warrant.
<s> The air's stopped.
<s> How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
<s> Answer them and quit kicking me!
<s> Right.
<s> Hardly.
<s> He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
<s> Seven hundred for the pair.
<s> It's hit us all hard!
<s> Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
<s> Well what?
<s> Like antiques.
<s> Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
<s> There were two old guns there; where are they?
<s> Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
<s> It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
<s> Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
<s> I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
<s> I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
<s> Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
<s> About twenty minutes.
<s> Try that one.
<s> Furry muff, let's go.
<s> What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
<s> Just hold on, I got the keys.
<s> Just give me the keys.
<s> How about you? All right?
<s> Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
<s> Hit the fuckers.
<s> Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
<s> You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
<s> I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
<s> . . . What?
<s> A hundred grand.
<s> Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
<s> Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
<s> You will what?
<s> Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
<s> I like your bar.
<s> Well, perhaps you can help?
<s> I think you'll find it is in your interest.
<s> I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
<s> You know how much it is, Nick.
<s> Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
<s> All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
<s> I'll only be a minute.
<s> Get your fingers out of my soup!
<s> You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
<s> Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
<s> Six.
<s> Twelve.
<s> That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
<s> I can fix cars.
<s> I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
<s> Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
<s> Yes, sir--
<s> No, sir. Not at all.
<s> From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
<s> If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
<s> Sergeant?
<s> You're testing me?
<s> Yes, Sergeant.
<s> Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
<s> Everybody on the border knows that story.
<s> You little pissant--
<s> That's in Maverick County.
<s> Do I seem jumpy?
<s> Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
<s> You look awful good in that uniform, though.
<s> Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
<s> So that's him--
<s> If it's too late--
<s> Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
<s> Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
<s> Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
<s> No sir.
<s> But they were Indians themselves.
<s> These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
<s> I finished that. I'm just messing around.
<s> Cool.
<s> Made some money, came back here--
<s> Lead mine.
<s> Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
<s> Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
<s> She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
<s> You could take it--
<s> Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> If the next guy's a redneck.
<s> Good deal you were born down here, then.
<s> You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
<s> That's where he fell.
<s> It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
<s> That's right.
<s> I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
<s> And people make their choice--
<s> You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
<s> Protection?
<s> They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
<s> Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
<s> We have a daughter.
<s> Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
<s> That Buddy was a cool breeze.
<s> We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
<s> When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
<s> Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
<s> And I understand why you might want to think he could.
<s> Do you?
<s> Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
<s> Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
<s> The Sheriff.
<s> I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
<s> Well, you hire illegals--
<s> I don't mean Fernando.
<s> I never said that.
<s> Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
<s> We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
<s> Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
<s> For a while.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
<s> Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
<s> You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
<s> I thought he busted you a couple times.
<s> Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
<s> They've got my Amado.
<s> We haven't talked since high school.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> I can't name anybody she does like these days.
<s> So she tells me three times a week.
<s> Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
<s> Pilar--
<s> Nothing.
<s> You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
<s> I came back 'cause you were here.
<s> More, I hope.
<s> Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
<s> If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
<s> The shooter local?
<s> Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
<s> I'm going over to the other side.
<s> They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
<s> I appreciate you telling me.
<s> I haven't seen anybody come by.
<s> Yeah. It's quiet--
<s> You think he killed anybody in Korea?
<s> They go together.
<s> How?
<s> My life was too weird for her.
<s> D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
<s> Right.
<s> Deep shit?
<s> All right.  It was...
<s> I know him.  I saw him.
<s> He's a priest?
<s> Not yet.
<s> It was me.
<s> And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
<s> He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
<s> No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
<s> I'm no bodyguard.
<s> It was more than that, I think.
<s> And they all came...
<s> Yes.
<s> Harry-?
<s> No word from D'Amour?
<s> Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
<s> The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
<s> I just saw him.
<s> Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
<s> I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
<s> I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
<s> He got up and walked.
<s> I heard he was the best.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> It's one in the afternoon.
<s> I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
<s> Mine.
<s> Are you a believer, then?
<s> Yes.  It's regrettable
<s> Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
<s> No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
<s> Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
<s> We've got to get you to a hospital.
<s> Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
<s> What's her problem?
<s> Does anybody?
<s> At birth.  I don't know you --
<s> I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
<s> You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
<s> You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
<s> Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
<s> I did it for Dorothea.
<s> Is that all?
<s> Looks that way.
<s> I got to go.  I'm late.
<s> What about Philip Swann?
<s> He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
<s> Who's not?
<s> No!
<s> You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
<s> Yes.
<s> My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
<s> Two years.
<s> I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
<s> Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
<s> I know, it's stupid.
<s> No.
<s> It's Charlotte.
<s> Do you want to have some breakfast?
<s> Yeah, you don't remember?
<s> That's ok.
<s> We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
<s> I know, but that's what you like about me.
<s> Yeah, look at that thing.
<s> Working.
<s> Yes, but no, I can't right now.
<s> You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
<s> I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
<s> Yes, no.
<s> Oh?
<s> What?
<s> Fine.
<s> I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
<s> It's Lydia, your wife.
<s> Fine. Is it going ok?
<s> Zoe, come say hello to your father...
<s> That's ok.
<s> No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
<s> That's ok, you'll figure it out.
<s> What?
<s> I got some hair stuff.
<s> Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
<s> Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
<s> Says she can get me in to see this killer.
<s> Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
<s> Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
<s> Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
<s> And how would you describe him?
<s> And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
<s> You know I'm not comfortable with this.
<s> This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
<s> I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
<s> Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
<s> I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
<s> You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
<s> You just call?
<s> Not pure evil.  That's correct.
<s> Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
<s> I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
<s> You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
<s> Peter, please...
<s> If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
<s> And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
<s> When's your birthday?
<s> What's the bible for?
<s> I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
<s> Maybe that's my problem.
<s> Until it happens, you're still a human being.
<s> What are these?
<s> So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
<s> Terrific.
<s> Whish the circumstances were different.
<s> You are the younger of two...
<s> It's Detective Smythe.
<s> There weren't any voices.
<s> Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
<s> Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
<s> Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
<s> He's looking right at me.
<s> Yeah, murder-suicide.
<s> Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
<s> Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
<s> Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
<s> Nothing.  So good luck.
<s> Dad around?
<s> Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> She's alright.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
<s> Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
<s> Why not?
<s> You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
<s> Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
<s> Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> You lost your head.
<s> Dad.  What are you doing here?
<s> That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
<s> Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
<s> Just wanted to say good game.
<s> What's up, Sidra.
<s> How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
<s> Just like that?
<s> What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
<s> Your legs don't look broke.
<s> Guess "please" would be a stretch.
<s> Who's Spalding?
<s> What?
<s> It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
<s> I know, right?
<s> Fine, Quincy.
<s> Right here.
<s> I wanted you to.
<s> You're not stupid.
<s> I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
<s> Not really.
<s> That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
<s> I'm alright.  But you can sit.
<s> Yup.
<s> A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
<s> Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
<s> Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> A rest?
<s> No.
<s> It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
<s> Something was just missing.
<s> What?
<s> you woke me up to tell me that?
<s> I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
<s> If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
<s> Well, can you give him this for me?
<s> What are you doing in my room?
<s> I've been hearing you.
<s> Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
<s> What mess?
<s> I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
<s> Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
<s> Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
<s> What?
<s> Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
<s> Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
<s> I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
<s> I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
<s> ooohhhhhh no.
<s> You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
<s> Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
<s> Does this sound weird?
<s> I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
<s> Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
<s> I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
<s> baby, please, please --
<s> Did you hear what I said?
<s> Who was it?
<s> Bit messy.
<s> -- do you wanna cup?
<s> -- is not my boyfriend.
<s> It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
<s> Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
<s> What is it?  Did you forget something?
<s> Really?
<s> What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
<s> Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
<s> Let's make a deal.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> ok.
<s> You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
<s> Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
<s> Wanna kiss me, Jim?
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Diet Coke.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Son, don't --
<s> I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
<s> It's ok, boy.
<s> I think it's more complicated than that little man.
<s> Sorry, little man.
<s> That's confidential information, little man.
<s> What's up?
<s> He's doing the interview with the lady --
<s> Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
<s> You're a friend of the family I presume?
<s> Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
<s> What?
<s> I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
<s> I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
<s> Mmm.Hmm.
<s> Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
<s> -- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
<s> FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
<s> Don't do this, Don.
<s> Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
<s> She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
<s> She loves you.
<s> When was the last time you talked to your son?
<s> Who?
<s> It's ok.
<s> Alright.  Thank you.
<s> Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
<s> So boring, so useless --
<s> I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
<s> I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
<s> An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
<s> So you sat it out, that's what you did?
<s> Around here.
<s> Well I guess it doesn't.
<s> She's retired.
<s> "Go Get 'Em, Honey."
<s> I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
<s> What name?  My name?
<s> I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
<s> Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
<s> Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
<s> About three weeks ago.
<s> I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
<s> yeah.
<s> Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
<s> You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
<s> Ok. What's your name?
<s> And what about screaming?
<s> What's this, how did this happen?
<s> I went out last night.
<s> No.
<s> I didn't hear anything.
<s> Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
<s> THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
<s> Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
<s> Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
<s> Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
<s> She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
<s> I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
<s> We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
<s> What about now?
<s> Do you have any children with anyone?
<s> I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
<s> <u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
<s> Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
<s> I don't know what I've done.
<s> I'm her father.
<s> Like what?
<s> What's MOW?
<s> I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
<s> Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
<s> You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> ....it's alright....
<s> ...I don't....
<s> Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
<s> Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
<s> Do you have that?
<s> Yes. What? Yes.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Shut up -- shut up --
<s> -- the fuck are you talking about?
<s> I didn't know the answer --
<s> I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
<s> Go to bed.
<s> Hi.
<s> It's ok.
<s> It's ok.
<s> ....Why does he do it...?
<s> It's not right.
<s> It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
<s> We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
<s> I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
<s> He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
<s> Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
<s> I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
<s> How goes that favor I asked of you?
<s> Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
<s> Those can be adopted --
<s> Yes, and he has a choice!
<s> In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
<s> But -- what is he doing?
<s> He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
<s> We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
<s> Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
<s> We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
<s> I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
<s> Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
<s> I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
<s> I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
<s> Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
<s> Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
<s> I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
<s> None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
<s> Perhaps this will help.
<s> Athos, my friend!
<s> I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
<s> If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
<s> Save my son, d'Artagnan.
<s> The King killed my son!
<s> An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
<s> No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
<s> There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
<s> How did you know -- ?
<s> Whose rooms are those?
<s> She will be at the ball.
<s> Phillippe.  Rest now.
<s> There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
<s> Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
<s> Thank you, your Majesty.
<s> It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
<s> Yes, your Majesty.
<s> They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
<s> I must insist, Sire.
<s> Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
<s> What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
<s> A letter.  May I see?
<s> I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
<s> Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
<s> So what?
<s> You mean shut your ass down!
<s> Alright, stay on the phone.
<s> Did you report it stolen?
<s> we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
<s> It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
<s> He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
<s> We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
<s> Don't worry -
<s> Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
<s> Gotta come from somewhere...
<s> She stole my car!!
<s> I didn't break in - the back door was open!
<s> Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
<s> No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
<s> I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
<s> Yeah?
<s> You're the mysterious type, right?
<s> Figure you would have tried it already.
<s> I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
<s> I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
<s> Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
<s> Please...
<s> Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
<s> OK...where do you want to start?
<s> I'm not going anywhere!
<s> I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
<s> I'm going to need a way to get there.
<s> Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
<s> I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
<s> Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
<s> Screw him!
<s> Not with this...
<s> Then what did you do, play canasta?
<s> Where is he?
<s> He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
<s> It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
<s> Twenty minutes max.
<s> That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
<s> Book code?
<s> Library of Congress.
<s> I have to.
<s> Because it's his bad luck to be special.
<s> Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
<s> What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
<s> I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
<s> I know...
<s> You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
<s> We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
<s> After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
<s> It's your call, Will. What do we do?
<s> I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
<s> There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
<s> What's that?
<s> Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
<s> Don't talk to me!!
<s> How far away's the back-up?
<s> Stay in the trees.
<s> Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
<s> Tonic will be fine.
<s> It's a surprise.
<s> I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
<s> Yes, are you okay...?!
<s> No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
<s> I have work to do at the plant.
<s> Are you okay...?
<s> No.
<s> No!
<s> I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> I'm very scared.
<s> Oh, God.
<s> You'll let me go now?
<s> I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
<s> Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
<s> I don't think I'll tell you.
<s> Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
<s> What about the dog?
<s> Blue, then.
<s> Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
<s> No.
<s> Will?  You could come up here.
<s> Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
<s> There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
<s> Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
<s> I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
<s> Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
<s> I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
<s> You read about it, I'm sure.
<s> There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
<s> You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
<s> Pretty well.
<s> I hope you have a second chance...
<s> I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
<s> Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
<s> You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
<s> Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
<s> Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
<s> But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
<s> That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
<s> Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
<s> Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
<s> Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
<s> But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
<s> But it's only for thirty seconds!
<s> Deal.
<s> These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
<s> I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
<s> Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
<s> I can shtop whenever I want...
<s> I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
<s> You don't know the real me.
<s> You're a wimp.
<s> Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
<s> What is this, World War Two...?
<s> Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
<s> I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
<s> Why??  I... I attend every year.
<s> It is apparently not working.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
<s> Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
<s> Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
<s> Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
<s> FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
<s> It's already begun.
<s> Two grand.
<s> I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
<s> If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
<s> My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
<s> He's going to pop!
<s> Really?
<s> Any time.
<s> I need an exit!  Fast!
<s> I got you.
<s> Goddamnit!
<s> I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
<s> Yes.  Now.
<s> The agents --
<s> ... Yes.
<s> You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
<s> Far from it.
<s> You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
<s> Wild, isn't it?
<s> A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
<s> For what?
<s> The body cannot live without the mind.
<s> How?
<s> Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
<s> Do it!
<s> He is the One.  He is the One!
<s> I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
<s> Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
<s> No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
<s> What is the Matrix?
<s> It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
<s> ... shit.
<s> Yes.
<s> A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
<s> Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
<s> What choice?
<s> Why?
<s> I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
<s> Not yet.
<s> If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
<s> They're hacking his mind.
<s> Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
<s> Because I believe in something.
<s> Duck!
<s> You're not far from Cypher.
<s> 'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
<s> You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
<s> Jewish...
<s> And say what?
<s> The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
<s> Giovanino!  Where have you been?
<s> I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
<s> C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
<s> Should I slap him?
<s> Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
<s> That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
<s> What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
<s> No you're not...
<s> He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
<s> You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
<s> C'mon Johnny.
<s> Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
<s> Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
<s> 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
<s> We'll be here.
<s> Stripper?
<s> Ok.
<s> What do they expect you to say?
<s> Well...
<s> An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
<s> Charlie...?
<s> You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
<s> Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
<s> It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
<s> Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
<s> But...
<s> Yeah, so things'll be even.
<s> Friends of yours Michael.
<s> Quiet please.
<s> And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
<s> You think so?
<s> He's cute.
<s> Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
<s> Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
<s> Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
<s> Of course.
<s> I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
<s> From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
<s> It's for the party, Dad --
<s> No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
<s> -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
<s> Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
<s> Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
<s> Yeah.  Goodnight.
<s> Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
<s> -- And now you're going to pee some more.
<s> I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
<s> 'Yes' to the deal?
<s> Uh -- he's from out of town --
<s> But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
<s> I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
<s> For how long?  And why?
<s> I don't think so.  Do you?
<s> The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
<s> You get not to go to jail.
<s> Joe, you do get around.
<s> 'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
<s> How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
<s> Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
<s> Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
<s> Obeah evil.  I not evil.
<s> Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
<s> She knows you real self?
<s> No.  Nothing.
<s> Didn't the family get together last night --?
<s> Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
<s> It's so very nice to see you again.
<s> No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
<s> Do I?  I'm a little confused.
<s> Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
<s> I'm lost.
<s> I haven't.
<s> Do you love Drew?
<s> I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
<s> Goodnight to you, Susan.
<s> Then why are you here, Joe?
<s> Patients have visitors, not doctors.
<s> Be sorry for nothing.
<s> It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
<s> It comforts you, doesn't it?
<s> I am, too.
<s> I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
<s> Gay?
<s> I said get out.
<s> Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
<s> How beautiful.
<s> Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
<s> Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
<s> You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
<s> Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
<s> Good morning, Bill.
<s> Make an exception?
<s> That's what everybody says.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Are you sad, Bill?
<s> Of course.
<s> No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
<s> Why didn't you stop me?
<s> I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
<s> That's okay.
<s> Then I can't help you.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that.
<s> Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
<s> What are you saying, that it's time to go?
<s> Not at all.
<s> Say again?
<s> How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
<s> Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
<s> It's time to put this person where he belongs.
<s> And we're very grateful.
<s> That's life.  What can I tell you?
<s> You fill the bill, Bill.
<s> 'Yes' is the answer to your question.
<s> It's enough now.
<s> I think you know --
<s> Yes, Bill.  The question.
<s> How's that, Quince?
<s> Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
<s> I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
<s> Does Drew tell you everything?
<s> ...Then don't.
<s> I am.  With you.
<s> You mean like you loved Mom?
<s> Don't get dirty, Dad --
<s> Nothing.
<s> We've met.
<s> Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
<s> Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
<s> It's something.
<s> Joe?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
<s> Where's he going?
<s> C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
<s> I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
<s> What's the way?
<s> You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
<s> I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
<s> Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
<s> I think I know her.
<s> Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
<s> From what?
<s> That's it.
<s> I'm sorry... um... ?

<s> Sorry.
<s> I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties.

<s> He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!

<s> Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
<s> Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
<s> Yes you do...
<s> Okay.  You got the "item"?
<s> Really?  So, what is this, a party?
<s> Havana.
<s> Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
<s> Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
<s> Zero risk.
<s> 'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
<s> Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
<s> "Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
<s> And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
<s> Chill out Sonny.
<s> As in...?
<s> You think I am in so deep I forgot?
<s> Okay.  What's up?
<s> A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
<s> Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
<s> Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
<s> Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
<s> We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
<s> But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
<s> What's it say?
<s> Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
<s> You set this up!
<s> I had to lay eyes on you.
<s> You're hoping to get a look at what?
<s> Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
<s> Said, a person's gotta make a living.
<s> Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
<s> Men, they mostly faggots.
<s> Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
<s> Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
<s> Yeah, oh yeah.
<s> Sure you're all right?
<s> I ain't sleepy.
<s> What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
<s> How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
<s> Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
<s> And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
<s> Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
<s> No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
<s> They gotta be.
<s> How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
<s> I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
<s> Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
<s> What?
<s> This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
<s> I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
<s> No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
<s> You bet I do, sir.
<s> Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
<s> I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
<s> ...He had a bald skull and...
<s> Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
<s> Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
<s> You want to split your hernia again?
<s> Nah, just covered with batshit!
<s> Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
<s> Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
<s> I know.
<s> Oh Jesus! 
<s> I'll pay extra
<s> Lucky girl.
<s> Twelve years.
<s> He wasn't even in the car?
<s> And?
<s> Billy!  Please!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
<s> Section 13?
<s> Where is it?
<s> Max - where?
<s> And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
<s> What is it? . . . Billy?
<s> Cat, ah!  Ayip!
<s> It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
<s> Who got the Frenchman out?
<s> Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
<s> Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
<s> Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
<s> I think so. One right, two lefts...
<s> Right.
<s> Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
<s> No, you talkin' at me.
<s> Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
<s> Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
<s> "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
<s> Depends.  You got a memo?
<s> The kid's with them!!
<s> Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
<s> I pull.
<s> Manny...
<s> Please.
<s> Don't get kinky here...
<s> No, there's...
<s> Toss the flare down!
<s> That's camouflage...
<s> What-
<s> That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
<s> Ah...
<s> That's it?
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> Fuck! It broke the skin...
<s> What?
<s> I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
<s> The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
<s> It has no nobility.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Misery?
<s> Well, I hope you like it.
<s> Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
<s> No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
<s> You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
<s> Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
<s> C'mere, I'll show you.
<s> No, just the paper will be fine.
<s> You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
<s> I want my pills NOW!
<s> I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
<s> They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
<s> I can't write this anymore.
<s> You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
<s> Have to wait.
<s> It looks wonderful. And so do you.
<s> Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
<s> Just from his agent.
<s> I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
<s> If I can.
<s> All done, chief..
<s> How do you that.
<s> Mmmm.
<s> Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
<s> I suppose I did.
<s> Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
<s> What else?
<s> Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
<s> Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
<s> Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
<s> I knew where it was.
<s> Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
<s> It's that time.  Go.
<s> A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
<s> Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I'm not ready!
<s> I hope there's a place to land.
<s> We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
<s> Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
<s> Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
<s> - torque wrench.
<s> At least you walked.
<s> Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
<s> Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
<s> So do I.  Sort of.
<s> Damn, you're beautiful.
<s> I'd like a little more conviction..
<s> Can you think of a better one?
<s> How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
<s> How do you suggest I go about it?
<s> Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
<s> I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
<s> You were there.
<s> - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
<s> - is where Miss Hall comes in.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yep.
<s> Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
<s> You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
<s> Nyah still on the property?
<s> By asking me.
<s> So what do you suggest?
<s> And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
<s> Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
<s> We got it.  On your feet.
<s> I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
<s> No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
<s> What happened to Jim?
<s> Who is they, who is they?
<s> I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
<s> We did what we had to do.
<s> Bastard!
<s> I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
<s> Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
<s> This stuff is so sticky.
<s> My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
<s> Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
<s> Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
<s> You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
<s> This whole operation was a molehunt.
<s> How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
<s> You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
<s> I need one hundred thousand dollars.
<s> Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
<s> My contact is extremely shy.
<s> Just waiting for you, tubs.
<s> Always.
<s> Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
<s> Very well.
<s> What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
<s> Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
<s> Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
<s> Can you lose him?
<s> <u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
<s> - and picked us up in the States -
<s> If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
<s> I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
<s> Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
<s> Jack you're so wicked.
<s> Itís not working.
<s> I always check the batteries.
<s> I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
<s> Well, what do you wanna talk about!
<s> Yes.
<s> Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
<s> No. You were there.
<s> Ti amo.
<s> What's your news?
<s> More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
<s> Maybe.
<s> It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
<s> Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
<s> You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
<s> Hurry up.
<s> I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
<s> Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
<s> Let me come and talk to you.
<s> I'm going to marry him.
<s> Maybe I should come back another time.
<s> I know that. I do what I want.
<s> Loretta.
<s> No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
<s> You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
<s> Because I have no Luck!
<s> Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
<s> All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
<s> I can't do that!
<s> That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
<s> Hi.
<s> He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
<s> Loretta, what are you talking about?
<s> What!
<s> Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
<s> I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
<s> You? No.
<s> My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
<s> Bobo, take the cart away.
<s> How about a month from today?
<s> Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
<s> A month from today?
<s> Who is he?
<s> I'm thirty-seven years old.
<s> She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
<s> Where's pop?
<s> Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
<s> Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
<s> You should think about this.
<s> My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
<s> Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
<s> It was a miracle!
<s> You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
<s> What happened?
<s> None of your business.
<s> I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
<s> Yes.
<s> No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
<s> Good night.
<s> Marriage is happy news.
<s> Is who down there?
<s> You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
<s> I knew she had it.
<s> And what do you burn, apart from witches?
<s> It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
<s> Through ... We found them.
<s> The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
<s> But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
<s> All of us are ... we are all Britons.
<s> You don't vote for kings.
<s> Who are they?
<s> NI!   NI!
<s> Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
<s> And not too expensive.
<s> That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
<s> I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
<s> You said it again!
<s> So be it!
<s> No, it isn't.
<s> Had enough ... ?
<s> You're a looney.
<s> This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
<s> Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
<s> Of course not!  You are English pigs.
<s> Bedevere, my Liege.
<s> Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
<s> No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
<s> It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
<s> How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
<s> Who did we lose?
<s> I'm thirty-seven.
<s> Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
<s> Come on, patsy.
<s> Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
<s> If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
<s> Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
<s> My name is Sir Launcelot.
<s> What is your quest?
<s> I'm not quite dead, sir ...
<s> Farewell, Concorde!
<s> Is it?
<s> But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
<s> ... and you'll come and get him.
<s> Leaving the room.
<s> No ... just keep him in here.
<s> The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
<s> Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
<s> I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
<s> No, It's nothing!
<s> Camelot ...
<s> Oh ... hello ...
<s> They're doctors?
<s> Don't say that word.
<s> Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
<s> Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
<s> Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
<s> I didn't.
<s> Seventy a year.
<s> Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
<s> You know what I mean.
<s> They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
<s> Oh, I'm much more than that.
<s> What do you take me for?
<s> I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
<s> Mary Taylor, sir.
<s> Kitchen and lower house.
<s> I see.
<s> Are you deaf as well as stupid?
<s> Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
<s> Back and upper corridors.
<s> Aye, do.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
<s> Why?
<s> I do what I do.
<s> Aye.
<s> See what?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
<s> To keep out the cold.
<s> I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
<s> Have I ever let you down before--?
<s> For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
<s> The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
<s> My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
<s> You can't know that for sure.
<s> It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
<s> Excellent!
<s> Dear oh dear.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why am I being lectured in this way?!
<s> I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
<s> I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
<s> From whom?
<s> Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
<s> Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
<s> Sure.
<s> There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
<s> Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
<s> Did you play ARCADE last night?
<s> Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
<s> Yeah...
<s> It's twelve-thirty!
<s> Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
<s> No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
<s> Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
<s> No way.
<s> My house.  I want to try something.
<s> Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
<s> What?
<s> No I'm not...
<s> Yes I am...
<s> What?!  There's nothing here!
<s> Never been on a snowboard.
<s> Hold my keys, then.
<s> Then we'll go home.
<s> That way.
<s> Yes...but...how did you...
<s> In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
<s> It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
<s> I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
<s> What's going on, Cynthia?
<s> What did you say?
<s> I agree with what you said...truly.
<s> Okay.
<s> You're an understandin' fella.
<s> Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
<s> Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
<s> You got it! See you later honey.
<s> Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
<s> Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
<s> I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
<s> No. I can't.
<s> May I have your name please?
<s> I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
<s> If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
<s> All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
<s> We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
<s> Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
<s> "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
<s> Do you know them?!
<s> Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
<s> Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
<s> Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
<s> To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
<s> Could be unrelated.
<s> I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
<s> Why should I ?
<s> Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
<s> I'm leaving.
<s> Why would he ? His parents are rich.
<s> Excuse me ?
<s> Is this really the time ?
<s> I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
<s> I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
<s> There's one more person here for me to visit.
<s> That's a shame.
<s> Hey , Hey !
<s> I don't help criminals.
<s> Not quite....
<s> You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
<s> Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
<s> What ?
<s> Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
<s> Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
<s> Fire the whole division.
<s> Sir ?
<s> Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
<s> We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
<s> What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
<s> We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
<s> Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
<s> I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
<s> You're paying the bills.
<s> Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
<s> Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
<s> He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
<s> Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
<s> Excuse me, gentlemen
<s> I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
<s> As appealing as that sounds...
<s> Wake up, we're in trouble.
<s> No ! Just get up. This is serious.
<s> What ?
<s> Zach from work ?
<s> We made it !
<s> Who was that guy anyway ?
<s> Good morning.
<s> Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
<s> Oh, just put it over there.
<s> UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
<s> What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
<s> What about giving the other guy a break.
<s> You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
<s> Okay thanks, atta girl.
<s> No it's okay, I understand, really.
<s> Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
<s> Great.
<s> Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
<s> Of course.
<s> Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
<s> Then I'll throw up a little bit.
<s> Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
<s> How about a nice glass of milk?
<s> Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
<s> I was pushing as fast as I could.
<s> Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
<s> I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
<s> You are?
<s> We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
<s> More than anything in the world.
<s> You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
<s> He likes you.
<s> Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
<s> I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
<s> Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
<s> But I wanna write about her.
<s> That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
<s> Hi.
<s> Then I have come to the right place.
<s> The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
<s> My mother.
<s> Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
<s> You're over reacting!
<s> I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
<s> WHAT??
<s> Just remember the needle in the haystack.
<s> Just give it to me!!
<s> DON'T!!!
<s> What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
<s> Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
<s> Big deal.
<s> I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
<s> 
<s> I'd consider it a personal favor.
<s> For the mini-bike fund.
<s> I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
<s> Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
<s> Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
<s> Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
<s> Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
<s> I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
<s> This is it I guess.
<s> Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
<s> Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
<s> Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
<s> I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
<s> No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
<s> You know how I feel about you.
<s> Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
<s> I'll be here.
<s> Well maybe for you.
<s> Sort of?
<s> Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
<s> I bet your mom sang to you.
<s> Is there milk in them already?
<s> When did you umm, I mean umm...
<s> Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
<s> I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
<s> But what about you and the baby? You need me.
<s> Hey! Oh look.
<s> O.K.
<s> Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
<s> Vada!!
<s> WHAT?
<s> I'm impressed.
<s> Yeah, all right...
<s> Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
<s> Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
<s> She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
<s> I'm sure she will.
<s> I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
<s> What's that?
<s> Here?
<s> I'll second that.
<s> Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
<s> Pointing upwards Look...
<s> I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
<s> I know that, but what do you want from me?
<s> Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
<s> O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
<s> They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
<s> Any more soda left?
<s> Ahh, maybe next summer.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
<s> No, no.
<s> Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
<s> It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
<s> That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
<s> Why do you think she says that?
<s> You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
<s> He likes her.
<s> Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
<s> Chocolate?
<s> It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
<s> Come here, sit down.
<s> Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
<s> They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
<s> Hi.
<s> Oh great!!
<s> It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
<s> I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> What are you saving for?
<s> Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
<s> That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
<s> I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
<s> No.
<s> That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
<s> I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
<s> It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
<s> Go???
<s> HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
<s> What?
<s> For their meat.
<s> My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
<s> But I have my clothes on!
<s> Hi, wanna ride bikes?
<s> I wanna live with them too.
<s> Really?
<s> My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
<s> He likes her better than me.
<s> No, I'm hiding out.
<s> But, I don't know how.
<s> But then I won't be able to see anything.
<s> Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
<s> Kindred spirits.
<s> You've been working on this, huh?
<s> And you believe that.
<s> It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
<s> The man you love.
<s> Someday she'll thank you.
<s> I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
<s> Oh, you're more than okay.
<s> What? Because I'm a little understand...
<s> ... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
<s> ... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
<s> Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
<s> ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
<s> ... whatever is manly and independent.
<s> Hello.
<s> He won't get mad, huh?
<s> Don't you see...
<s> ... look good on Kimberly.
<s> ... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
<s> I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
<s> I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
<s> ... Thomas, yeh.
<s> Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
<s> Firenze.
<s> Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
<s> What, leaving school...
<s> I got the point.
<s> Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
<s> Like I said, dazzling.
<s> Yes.
<s> It means a lot.
<s> The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
<s> And your point?
<s> She admits it's her fault.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Well, it happens.
<s> Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
<s> This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
<s> ... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
<s> Lower.
<s> Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
<s> I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
<s> MICHAEL!!
<s> An so it is.
<s> Well, that just happened that time.
<s> You got a real good memory, Star.
<s> I won first prize.
<s> Don't feel that way, honey.
<s> What?
<s> Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
<s> Thank you-- Yes, I am.
<s> Bye, Bye.
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> Okay. Thanks.
<s> They can come to the concert in the park.
<s> Who the hell is he?
<s> Who the hell is he?
<s> Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
<s> Whose?
<s> Sure thing.
<s> Okay.
<s> When is it?
<s> What crook?
<s> Your brother?
<s> Sure he will.
<s> Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
<s> I think we can do that. Come in.
<s> She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
<s> It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
<s> Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
<s> Maybe you can look after me a little.
<s> Nash.
<s> Oh... Well.
<s> Next you'll be sick.
<s> How are you going to pay when you get sick?
<s> Bet the sheets are grey.
<s> But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
<s> Bye.
<s> When I was little, in church.
<s> Yes, it is --
<s> Older.
<s> Well...
<s> That's what you said before.
<s> Yea.
<s> Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
<s> Hello.
<s> For him?
<s> You're real favorites of his.
<s> They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
<s> Did it break?
<s> No, we never did that
<s> No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
<s> I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
<s> I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
<s> Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
<s> Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
<s> Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
<s> That's what Tim said.
<s> Yes, they were.
<s> When ya had it, did ya like it?
<s> It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
<s> I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
<s> What?
<s> There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
<s> It's video.
<s> She sings? What does she sing?
<s> That's indescribable.
<s> When have they ever been right?
<s> Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
<s> So, what now?
<s> I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
<s> It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
<s> Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
<s> And a snake-eye glare.
<s> That's the way of the world.
<s> Survival of the fittest.
<s> Wayne---
<s> Thanks.
<s> They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
<s> Perfecto!
<s> Slate it.
<s> That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
<s> Really?
<s> Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
<s> See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
<s> Lose 'em.
<s> Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
<s> Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
<s> Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
<s> Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
<s> You in a big hurry, boy?
<s> That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
<s> That's right.
<s> I don't know what you're talkin' about.
<s> I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
<s> Don't start no trouble, boy!
<s> You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
<s> Okay.
<s> Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
<s> That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
<s> Yeah. On the section gang.
<s> Went to college, huh?
<s> You keep asking me why I'm here.
<s> I like a place with lots of life.
<s> Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
<s> You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
<s> Why did you?
<s> 'Been up north?
<s> Just for the day?
<s> I didn't know you had one.
<s> Are you married?
<s> Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
<s> I'll see you later.
<s> You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
<s> Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
<s> Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
<s> She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
<s> Well, what d'you think?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Don't call them that.
<s> Smells like something crawled in there and died.
<s> My father's never done a thing for any of them.
<s> You jivin' me?
<s> We'll be all right.
<s> You will.
<s> Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
<s> Watch out!
<s> Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
<s> Why don't you relax, Frankie?
<s> Take it easy, Frankie.
<s> How 'bout the key?
<s> Yeah, see you in hell.
<s> Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
<s> Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
<s> I heard you.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Okay.
<s> She don't look no worse to me.
<s> Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
<s> That's right.
<s> No, they won't.
<s> How are you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I guess I ain't.
<s> Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
<s> You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
<s> 'Musta knocked her up.
<s> Okay, boy, beat it.
<s> I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
<s> She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
<s> It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
<s> The Elders, mon...
<s> Why not?
<s> And how do you suggest I do that?
<s> Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
<s> Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
<s> You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
<s> No, but it traced me.
<s> I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
<s> Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
<s> It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
<s> That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
<s> Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
<s> Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
<s> Can you walk?
<s> No problem, amigo.
<s> Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
<s> When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
<s> Can you take me to it?
<s> So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
<s> What?
<s> And Linda...
<s> I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
<s> Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
<s> We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
<s> What the fuck... are you serious?
<s> You're not ready yet. They said two days.
<s> Too late?
<s> Won't that mean you're dead?
<s> Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
<s> ...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
<s> Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
<s> No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
<s> Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
<s> Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Petty good.
<s> Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
<s> Yes, it's lame.
<s> Right. 7:30.
<s> OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
<s> And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
<s> I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
<s> And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
<s> It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
<s> Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
<s> Five-- Six--
<s> Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
<s> Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
<s> Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
<s> Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
<s> You're a sick puppy, Geller.
<s> Have you been there?
<s> No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
<s> Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
<s> No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
<s> I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
<s> Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
<s> Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
<s> Do you remember high school?
<s> Don't you remember what they called you?
<s> Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
<s> Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
<s> No. Josie, this is real.
<s> With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
<s> Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
<s> You remember that story?
<s> But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
<s> I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
<s> Yeah. Definitely.
<s> Maybe we should sit.
<s> Barrel.
<s> For this.
<s> Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
<s> I can't help it.
<s> Good.  I'm hungry.
<s> I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<s> Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
<s> He stayed a long time.
<s> <i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<s> <i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<s> <i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
<s> Oh, come on Dad...
<s> It's not the gas, Dad!
<s> Oh, please...
<s> She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
<s> Shut up, Grady.
<s> Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
<s> Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
<s> Yeah, yeah, sure.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I'll get over it.
<s> I don't know - a sharp pain.
<s> My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
<s> I can't!
<s> Sure...go ahead.
<s> Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
<s> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
<s> First door up the stairs.
<s> I had such an awful dream.
<s> Don't hold your breath.
<s> Research.
<s> It's an amazing gift.
<s> You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
<s> He's heavy in the halls...
<s> I think so.
<s> It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
<s> Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
<s> Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
<s> Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
<s> Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
<s> I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
<s> Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
<s> With Hypnocyl?
<s> You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
<s> Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
<s> Doesn't matter.
<s> Remember -- open mind.
<s> Anything?
<s> Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
<s> Your dreams?
<s> Neil, please --
<s> How do we get in?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Mary Helena.
<s> Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
<s> Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
<s> Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
<s> I'm a vegetarian.
<s> I'm not listening.
<s> And what happens next in the dream?
<s> You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
<s> It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
<s> You abide by rules like that?
<s> Yes, you did.
<s> She left me.
<s> I don't know, I'm afraid.
<s> Oh no no -- no.
<s> Would you like me to take you through your lines?
<s> I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
<s> The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
<s> Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
<s> What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
<s> You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
<s> That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
<s> I only found out you were here yesterday.
<s> Okay.
<s> Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
<s> What's the thing?
<s> Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
<s> I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
<s> Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
<s> Is that right?
<s> Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
<s> He wouldn't say.
<s> And this is William.
<s> Anna Scott?
<s> Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
<s> Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
<s> Tony -- what do you think?
<s> Yes -- sort of...
<s> Well, yes.  Groovy.
<s> It was good.
<s> Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
<s> Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
<s> Yes?
<s> Ah... yes, enormously.
<s> Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
<s> Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
<s> Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
<s> Can I help you?
<s> No, it doesn't.
<s> I think you do, yes.
<s> No -- did you?
<s> And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
<s> How about Miss Flintstone?
<s> Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
<s> No, no.  She doesn't.
<s> This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
<s> Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
<s> Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
<s> Two?  That's it?
<s> What?
<s> I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
<s> I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
<s> And you get on very well.
<s> Why not?
<s> What book?
<s> Yes, that is correct.
<s> I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
<s> Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
<s> I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
<s> I was in luh-love with her.
<s> Who? Tell me!
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
<s> Sorry, ma'am.
<s> No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
<s> What for?
<s> Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
<s> He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
<s> No, it was irresponsible!
<s> Yes, ma'am?
<s> Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
<s> H-H-Hearts.
<s> B-B-Billy.
<s> Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
<s> Good boy, thank you, Billy.
<s> Thank you.
<s> No.
<s> What? Where?
<s> Where ya goin', Mac?
<s> Right, Mack!
<s> Lemme see...
<s> What?
<s> A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
<s> Okay, Harding, you're on.
<s> I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
<s> What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
<s> No!
<s> I'm not running a charity ward...
<s> Gary Blinker...
<s> Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
<s> Me. Hit me!
<s> Hold it a minute.
<s> No. Me! Me!
<s> No.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
<s> It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
<s> Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
<s> I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
<s> 'Kay, Mac!
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> Yeah, what's up?
<s> Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
<s> To help you relax... please...
<s> No...
<s> He's in charge.
<s> P.A. What the hell is that?
<s> Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
<s> Thank you, ma'am,
<s> Huh?
<s> Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
<s> Evenin', ma'am.
<s> Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
<s> Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
<s> He's dead.
<s> Oh, yeah...
<s> Why?
<s> My friend has lost her fucking mind...
<s> What for?
<s> --separate, in the evening..."
<s> Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
<s> I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
<s> No...
<s> What's mezzaluna?
<s> Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
<s> If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
<s> Okaaaaayyyy.
<s> No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
<s> Non.  Please.
<s> Hm.
<s> Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
<s> NO.
<s> If it's any of your business, yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
<s> No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
<s> Who says I don't love him?...
<s> Where's Positano?
<s> Please.  I need to know.
<s> Hi.
<s> Well, good.  Good for you.
<s> What?
<s> Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
<s> No.  Course not.
<s> Well.  Congratulations.
<s> You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
<s> No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
<s> There is no us.
<s> Just since yesterday.
<s> Tonight?
<s> Yes?
<s> Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
<s> Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
<s> So, what's your point?
<s> Is he married?
<s> Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
<s> It's a coincidence.
<s> Because you were afraid to fly.
<s> You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
<s> "Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
<s> Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
<s> Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
<s> He fell out.
<s> Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
<s> The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
<s> Only what?
<s> What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
<s> I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
<s> Because I'm the one who's single.
<s> Oh my God.  Where?
<s> Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
<s> Hi.  Where've you been?
<s> What about Peter?...
<s> I'll be back before you leave.
<s> What if he doesn't like me?
<s> Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
<s> No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
<s> You miss me?...
<s> Good strategy.
<s> Why should he forget it?
<s> Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
<s> That was the idea.
<s> I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
<s> But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
<s> Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
<s> You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
<s> Maybe.
<s> I could have been better!
<s> I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
<s> I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
<s> I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
<s> Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
<s> You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
<s> Tommy, what happened?
<s> Do you like pigeons?
<s> Good. So do I.
<s> The things that go on.
<s> I am?
<s> I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
<s> Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
<s> What for?
<s> I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
<s> Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
<s> I can't let myself fall in love with you.
<s> I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
<s> I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
<s> There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
<s> Terry, what's wrong?
<s> You?
<s> I just told the Father.
<s> What I did to Joey.
<s> Get away from me.
<s> I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
<s> Well, it's over.
<s> Are you sure they're your friends?
<s> He's going to have to grow up too.
<s> Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
<s> Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
<s> He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
<s> You are like—
<s> Let me by.
<s> Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
<s> How much is your soul worth if you don't?
<s> You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
<s> Mind your own business, Father.
<s> You go to—
<s> A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
<s> I can? Okay.  Okay...
<s> Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
<s> Sure... .
<s> Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
<s> You'll work.
<s> You'd be off the pier for good.
<s> Be sure they got enough water.
<s> I'll bring him up to your loft.
<s> Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if—
<s> Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
<s> How'd you get that.
<s> Listen, Johnny—
<s> You want to know somethin'—?
<s> Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Go on, beat it!
<s> Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
<s> Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
<s> Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
<s> No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
<s> You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
<s> That's life.  My kisses are alive.
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
<s> I should hope not.  I hate you!
<s> What can we do against them?
<s> There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
<s> Of course I do.
<s> A symbol, Master.
<s> Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
<s> At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
<s> You mean...!
<s> Then why do you shake so?
<s> Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
<s> Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
<s> Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
<s> Who is it?
<s> I know a Glenn.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
<s> Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
<s> His assistant.
<s> Why don't we talk about it later?
<s> That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
<s> Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
<s> You're right.
<s> There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
<s> Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
<s> We'll leave first thing in the morning.
<s> You better come see this.
<s> In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
<s> He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
<s> What's he do now, tell fortunes?
<s> Just hung up.
<s> Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
<s> Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
<s> Yeah, and I better call my sister.
<s> It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
<s> Whatta you wanna do?
<s> I get that feeling, yeah.
<s> Shit.
<s> Jack --
<s> Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
<s> You have to know what you're talking about.
<s> But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
<s> Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
<s> You're gonna use a ram?
<s> The manager's door is metal.
<s> You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
<s> Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
<s> Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
<s> I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
<s> Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
<s> Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
<s> I don't smoke.
<s> Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
<s> It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
<s> We're leaving.
<s> That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
<s> You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
<s> I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
<s> Of course I am.
<s> Faye Dunaway.
<s> Peter Finch.
<s> You'd probably tell me.
<s> Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
<s> I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
<s> Really.  He has a cop's face.
<s> And your gun.
<s> How do we do that?
<s> It's not a game.  Something you play.
<s> Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
<s> So do you.
<s> Yeah, but in a nice way.
<s> He killed a police officer.
<s> I'm just going to the bathroom.
<s> I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
<s> Pretend I'm somebody else.
<s> What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
<s> I see better with them on.
<s> Must be a real soft pillow.
<s> Really?  Well, I uhhh...
<s> I don't know.  I never used a gun.
<s> You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
<s> No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
<s> Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
<s> First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
<s> That time?
<s> Hejira.
<s> Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
<s> I remember you now.  Shit.
<s> We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
<s> What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
<s> No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
<s> I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
<s> You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
<s> What do you want?
<s> He said he stayed with Maurice.
<s> Your dog was killed?
<s> What did you call it?
<s> The State Theater?
<s> It's a --
<s> What're you doing at Glades?
<s> You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
<s> You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
<s> What'd I say?
<s> Huh.
<s> Hello?
<s> Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
<s> I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
<s> Like a fag.
<s> The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
<s> I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
<s> Yeah, as soon as we got back.
<s> Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
<s> White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
<s> If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
<s> You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
<s> Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
<s> Yes Sir.
<s> You liked that?
<s> They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
<s> The Colonel helped me work it out.
<s> I was grieving too.
<s> So what are you saying?
<s> You left her.  How's that for a fact?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
<s> We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
<s> I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
<s> Well...sure.
<s> Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
<s> You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
<s> Boxin'.
<s> You too, 'Mam.
<s> You waited til tonight to tell me?
<s> I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
<s> The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
<s> And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
<s> If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
<s> I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
<s> I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
<s> It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
<s> I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
<s> It's that jerk Walter.
<s> Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
<s> Don't say that...
<s> I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
<s> I'm not going.
<s> Charlie! Am I dead?
<s> Refresh my memory.
<s> They'll learn to live with it.
<s> Rejected, worthless, miserable.
<s> Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
<s> I have to talk to you..
<s> I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
<s> Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
<s> How'd you know about that?
<s> Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
<s> Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
<s> What?
<s> I've got to go now.
<s> I'm trying.
<s> Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
<s> What about Janet?
<s> She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
<s> Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
<s> Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
<s> What're you doing here anyway?
<s> I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
<s> Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
<s> Don't you get along with your parents?
<s> They care about you. They're just a different generation.
<s> Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
<s> Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
<s> Evelyn, put her to bed.
<s> I think I'm way ahead of them.
<s> Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
<s> Doing some shopping?
<s> Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
<s> You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
<s> Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
<s> How do you feel?
<s> I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
<s> What about?
<s> She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
<s> I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
<s> I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
<s> He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
<s> Rosalie Testa!
<s> You're a sweet man, Richard.
<s> I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
<s> I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
<s> What's that?
<s> I	know what a burrito is.
<s> This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
<s> Am I dead or not?
<s> I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
<s> I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
<s> I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
<s> Come on. You can't be serious.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> High tech. I like the sound of that.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
<s> That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
<s> Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
<s> Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
<s> I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
<s> It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
<s> You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
<s> There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
<s> How'd you know that?
<s> All the time.
<s> You know everything, don't you?
<s> Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
<s> There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
<s> Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
<s> Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
<s> I am relaxed.
<s> I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
<s> Close the law book.
<s> CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
<s> Maybe you should think about it.
<s> That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
<s> More than your friend. Family.
<s> He's upset, he's sorry.
<s> One week old.
<s> Continue.
<s> We?
<s> Makeup.
<s> Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
<s> They sabotaged me.
<s> Fine.
<s> I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
<s> There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
<s> I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
<s> Not unnecessary ones.
<s> Gay movies.
<s> As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
<s> Yes.
<s> Is that a question?
<s> What did you say?
<s> Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
<s> You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
<s> That's correct.
<s> It satisfied me.
<s> Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
<s> Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
<s> Give me the camera, Joe.
<s> Duh...
<s> Probably since she was born.
<s> Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
<s> A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
<s> So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
<s> Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
<s> Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
<s> We ought to be suing him.
<s> Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
<s> ... It's time to get this society back on track!
<s> He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
<s> Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
<s> The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
<s> Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
<s> Entered our minds.
<s> Had it with deals.
<s> Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
<s> Saw something I didn't like.
<s> <u>Listen</u>.
<s> Think about what?
<s> Get out of our way.
<s> Let's drop back an' boot up.
<s> Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
<s> Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
<s> You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
<s> But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
<s> We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
<s> Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
<s> Probably right.
<s> That's what I said.
<s> May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
<s> I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
<s> We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
<s> What the hell's it matter?
<s> I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
<s> -- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
<s> He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
<s> So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
<s> One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
<s> You know who Muhammad was?
<s> Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
<s> For now.
<s> Quiet, please. Everyone.
<s> Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
<s> Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
<s> Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
<s> Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
<s> We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
<s> Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
<s> Looks clear.
<s> Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
<s> Nice embellishment.
<s> What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
<s> Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
<s> It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
<s> We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
<s> Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
<s> No.
<s> Remembers what?
<s> Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
<s> And they fell out of the sky with you?
<s> And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
<s> I don't. And I'm not going to try.
<s> That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
<s> There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
<s> Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
<s> But how long is a day?
<s> Blessed are the vegetarians.
<s> I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
<s> That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
<s> Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
<s> See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
<s> Huh?
<s> We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
<s> Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
<s> Taylor.	I'm telling you --
<s> Don't bother
<s> Try telling them our names.
<s> Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
<s> I think you're making a mistake.
<s> What?
<s> A man, Dr. Maximus.
<s> My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
<s> By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
<s> Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
<s> Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
<s> My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
<s> I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
<s> All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
<s> Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
<s> Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
<s> Shhhh!
<s> A hearing.
<s> Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
<s> Maybe not.
<s> He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
<s> Why not?
<s> He doesn't know.
<s> KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
<s> Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
<s> Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
<s> Fuck you bitch.
<s> Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
<s> You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
<s> Where's Elias come from?
<s> Yeah. How 'bout you?
<s> Barnes believes in what he's doing.
<s> Nah...
<s> They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
<s> You know what I'm talking about!
<s> So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
<s> I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
<s> That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
<s> My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
<s> Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
<s> I really don't know.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm supposing.
<s> I haven't been invited.
<s> Just drunk enough.
<s> I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
<s> No, please.
<s> You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
<s> As I said before...
<s> Whatever you say.
<s> No thank you.
<s> What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
<s> I don't.
<s> Just who are you, anyway?
<s> Is this the best you can do?
<s> Dance? Here?
<s> All right--following me.
<s> Nothing matters.
<s> But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
<s> This must have cost a fortune.
<s> Do you have to leave the note?
<s> Killaine's wise to what?
<s> I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
<s> That's right.
<s> You-killed-him?
<s> Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
<s> Do you think I was faking?
<s> I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
<s> Is it a crime?
<s> Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
<s> There isn't anything you can do.
<s> I don't want to talk.
<s> Points very straight to her.
<s> We know everything.
<s> I'm not interested in blind dates.
<s> You asked for it.
<s> You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
<s> I've got good ears.
<s> I never notice the view after the first week.
<s> A couple of hours.
<s> That must hurt.
<s> That COULD BE TOLD.
<s> Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
<s> Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
<s> Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
<s> You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
<s> I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
<s> I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
<s> You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
<s> He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
<s> I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
<s> I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
<s> I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
<s> Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
<s> Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
<s> Go live in a tent.
<s> So it seems Sergeant.
<s> I've met her.
<s> If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
<s> Pretty big chance, huh?
<s> Well.  What about it?
<s> So?
<s> If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
<s> Oh nothing.
<s> Positive?
<s> How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
<s> It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
<s> You didn't play it for laughs last night.
<s> The card says so, doesn't it?
<s> We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
<s> Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
<s> What are my orders, sir?
<s> With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
<s> You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
<s> You don't have to make a pose of it.
<s> Years, why?
<s> You already have the checks, darling.
<s> In an hour, Larry.
<s> Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
<s> Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
<s> I think you'll do very well.
<s> Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
<s> Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
<s> Hello.
<s> ...break away completely from--
<s> Thank you.
<s> And to history.
<s> Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
<s> Too bad.  What did your father do?
<s> How nice.
<s> Very thoughtful.
<s> No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
<s> No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
<s> What did he want?
<s> That'll be fun
<s> Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
<s> To the Fleet.
<s> It's shit.
<s> Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
<s> Let me see.
<s> Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
<s> I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
<s> Fuck off.
<s> My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
<s> Hello.
<s> Why not sit down and wait?
<s> That's good.
<s> Darling Susan.
<s> Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
<s> The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
<s> Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
<s> My man!
<s> Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
<s> After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
<s> Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
<s> Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
<s> Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
<s> I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Sir?
<s> A little mushy.
<s> Babes.
<s> Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
<s> That's the point, isn't it?
<s> Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
<s> Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
<s> The fucking punks are surfers.
<s> Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
<s> Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
<s> It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
<s> Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
<s> Right here, partner.
<s> Did he rob it?
<s> Figured you did.
<s> No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
<s> Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
<s> Catch of the day.
<s> What?
<s> Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
<s> Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> No way, old buddy.
<s> Like the old days, Dillon.
<s> They're getting better equipped every day.
<s> Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
<s> We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
<s> Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
<s> Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
<s> You know you can't win this one.
<s> We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
<s> What's that, General?
<s> I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
<s> Philip!  We'll need shoes!
<s> I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
<s> Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
<s> You what?
<s> I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
<s> I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
<s> You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
<s> Yes.
<s> The price just went up to ten.
<s> If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
<s> Edward.  My name is Edward.
<s> Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
<s> Why?
<s> Off the boulevard.
<s> Oooh, thank god.
<s> If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
<s> Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
<s> Mmm, I could tell.
<s> I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
<s> I sell them.
<s> Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
<s> Done.
<s> It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
<s> Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
<s> Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
<s> I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
<s> Huh?
<s> You just did.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Oh, god, what?
<s> But, Edward...
<s> Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
<s> Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
<s> Everybody keeps starin' at me.
<s> School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
<s> You're a guest here?
<s> Vivian.
<s> I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
<s> Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
<s> Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
<s> What if they serve soup?
<s> I like steak.
<s> Steak spoon! 
<s> Me?
<s> Yes.  Something... conservative.
<s> I don't think it would fit you.
<s> Do you remember me?
<s> Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
<s> I do not marry tonight.
<s> I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
<s> You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
<s> What? -- go on --
<s> No. No. We have already succeeded.
<s> Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
<s> Gently.
<s> Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
<s> You never said anything about killing anyone.
<s> I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
<s> Veer left. Left. Left!
<s> Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
<s> Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
<s> He's really very short on charm.
<s> Yes, some of the time. 
<s> -- what? --
<s> Over the Albino, I think.
<s> What?
<s> Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
<s> -- murdered by pirates is good --
<s> Because I can stop now if you want.
<s> Someday, you may not mind so much.
<s> Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
<s> You want me to read this or not?
<s> I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
<s> I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
<s> Who won? How did it end?
<s> I swear it will be done.
<s> Yes.
<s> Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
<s> Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
<s> And our assets?
<s> He's already dead.
<s> Hah?
<s> Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
<s> Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
<s> Again. Thank you.
<s> You are ready, then?
<s> Then why are you smiling?
<s> You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
<s> I will. And I choose --
<s> Don't say another word, Valerie.
<s> Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
<s> Nobody's hearing nothing!
<s> An hour.
<s> Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
<s> I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
<s> What are you saying?
<s> "Of the silvery moon,
<s> "Honeymoon,
<s> I'll wait in the hall ...
<s> Oh, it's all right ... wha?
<s> You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
<s> Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
<s> What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
<s> You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
<s> Aaaaaaaaaa!
<s> I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
<s> Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
<s> I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
<s> Right.
<s> I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
<s> I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
<s> No way out.  No way out.
<s> Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
<s> Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
<s> He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
<s> Really, I never dreamed ...
<s> It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
<s> Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
<s> Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
<s> Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
<s> Come on.  Let's get going.
<s> I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
<s> Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
<s> Here I come, ready or not.
<s> Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
<s> Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
<s> Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
<s> And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
<s> I shall count the minutes.
<s> Of Siegfried...
<s> Bismark...
<s> Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
<s> What do you do best?
<s> Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
<s> No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
<s> Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
<s> Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
<s> I told them we invaded England.
<s> In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
<s> Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
<s> No.
<s> I'm not the police.
<s> No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
<s> Tell me all about her.
<s> Of which morning?
<s> She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
<s> Anyone at home?
<s> Money.
<s> How much?
<s> I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
<s> You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
<s> Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
<s> How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
<s> May I talk to you?
<s> To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
<s> Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
<s> I hate tears. 
<s> Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
<s> You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
<s> How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
<s> You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
<s> Well?
<s> All right! Then call! At least, call!
<s> Of course we will.
<s> I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
<s> We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
<s> Watch your tenses.
<s> You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
<s> Hospital clean.
<s> The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
<s> When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
<s> Sam. This is the last time.
<s> I have to go, Sam.
<s> Sam! No!
<s> You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
<s> Don't miss your plane.
<s> Los Angeles.
<s> It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
<s> Uncommon, too.
<s> It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
<s> Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
<s> Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
<s> Very early. Dawn.
<s> He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
<s> That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
<s> Shut up!
<s> This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
<s> What--special autopsy?
<s> Did she talk?
<s> Indeed, he has often told me.
<s> [Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
<s> I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
<s> Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
<s> Maybe you want my money, too.
<s> Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
<s> Why didn't you notify the police?
<s> Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
<s> Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
<s> Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
<s> He isn't here.
<s> Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
<s> It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
<s> In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
<s> You would.
<s> I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
<s> Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
<s> Delighted, I'm sure. 
<s> She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
<s> What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
<s> Well, I do say it.
<s> Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
<s> I'm not quarreling, only ...
<s> I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
<s> Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
<s> And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
<s> What do you think I am?
<s> It happens that I'm the law.
<s> Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
<s> I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
<s> Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
<s> Get out of here.
<s> I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
<s> Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
<s> No kiddin'. What's your idea?
<s> We'll grant that.
<s> That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
<s> Almost certain.
<s> Don't remember what day that was, do you?
<s> Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
<s> Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
<s> It's all yours.
<s> Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
<s> Cry-baby?
<s> My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
<s> No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
<s> Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
<s> What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
<s> Heaven knows. A lot.
<s> If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
<s> Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
<s> Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Dad...
<s> You did.
<s> You did miss --
<s> It's an experiment.
<s> At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
<s> God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
<s> Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
<s> Wait.  I want to tell you something.
<s> So I can move on.  You too.
<s> Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
<s> But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
<s> What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
<s> Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
<s> Well, some fiend might.
<s> Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
<s> Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
<s> But why, if I'm not hurting you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> He did?
<s> They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
<s> I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
<s> Well, it's not very plain.
<s> In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
<s> What did you say, Brother?
<s> She's getting herself up to go out.
<s> I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
<s> She's watching the car again?
<s> Yeah.
<s> They're discussing it.
<s> Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
<s> Let me see!
<s> Boy! Wow!
<s> What are they doing?
<s> Then why does she act so dumb?
<s> Doll, don't ask childish questions.
<s> Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
<s> It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
<s> Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
<s> Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
<s> Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
<s> At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
<s> No, son, she is dead.
<s> I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
<s> It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
<s> Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
<s> Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
<s> Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
<s> Oh. Did you say something?
<s> There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
<s> I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
<s> Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
<s> Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
<s> The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
<s> Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
<s> You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
<s> You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
<s> Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
<s> She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
<s> Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
<s> I... I'll get the grits.
<s> Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
<s> Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
<s> Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
<s> Mine.
<s> All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
<s> Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
<s> Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
<s> Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
<s> I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
<s> Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
<s> But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
<s> That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
<s> Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
<s> Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
<s> Really?  Is that a fact... ?
<s> Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
<s> Again.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
<s> I need the "when" and the "where."
<s> Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
<s> We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
<s> No you can't.
<s> I'm just saying...
<s> I got him.
<s> Feeling great.
<s> Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
<s> Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
<s> I'm waiting till the time's right.
<s> What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
<s> Well, sir...
<s> Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
<s> Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
<s> Slow down.
<s> I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
<s> Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
<s> I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
<s> Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
<s> Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
<s> Your wish is my command.
<s> Who is that... ?
<s> Seatbelts fastened, please.
<s> Know what I love about dynamite?
<s> They're... around.
<s> The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
<s> All right. Stand by.
<s> Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
<s> We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
<s> You cannot escape your destiny.
<s> Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
<s> Yoda spoke of another.
<s> But I have no sister.
<s> You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
<s> Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
<s> Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
<s> His lightsaber.
<s> Luke!
<s> Hi, Han... Chewie.
<s> We got separated.
<s> Leia!
<s> That's all any of us can see.
<s> Ahhh...
<s> Charges!  Come on, come on!
<s> I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
<s> Let's see.
<s> Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
<s> The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
<s> Red Leader standing by.
<s> Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
<s> Oh, no.
<s> Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
<s> Just...images, really. Feelings.
<s> She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
<s> Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
<s> You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
<s> But, why must you confront him?
<s> Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
<s> I will not fight you, father.
<s> There is no conflict.
<s> Oh. Well, yes.
<s> Certainly not!
<s> You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
<s> Made me give you the eye And then panic,
<s> And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
<s> Dammit, Janet.
<s> Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
<s> There's no point both of us getting wet.
<s> Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
<s> We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
<s> I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
<s> Weiss.
<s> It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
<s> Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
<s> And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
<s> A decision had to be made.
<s> Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
<s> Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
<s> Like I'm outside in the rain
<s> No no no no.
<s> You're too kind.
<s> Oh.
<s> ...I don't know.
<s> I think it's closed.
<s> ...No thanks.
<s> Yes.
<s> I think he might be worried.
<s> I don't think I belong here.
<s> What?
<s> Could ya take off that hat.
<s> Don't tease me.
<s> Yes.
<s> -- The legs.
<s> Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
<s> What're we going to do?
<s> Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
<s> What?!
<s> You's the novelty, Champ!
<s> Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
<s> ...This man.
<s> Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
<s> Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
<s> Charge it.
<s> There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
<s> Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
<s> Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
<s> That's it.
<s> I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
<s> You think I don't hear things?
<s> No action.
<s> I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
<s> Why?
<s> C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...Tomato?
<s> ...What?
<s> Come July, twenty-five.
<s> Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
<s> ...No.
<s> When was they here?
<s> I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
<s> ...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
<s> Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
<s> ...I'm doin' it for a friend.
<s> ...The guy's great.
<s> 'Bout what?
<s> Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
<s> Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
<s> Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
<s> ...Sure.
<s> Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
<s> Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
<s> Whatta these guys want?
<s> What can I do about it?
<s> Maybe --
<s> Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
<s> So where is it then?
<s> Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
<s> Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
<s> What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
<s> No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
<s> He's a Toon... who cares?
<s> I'll bet.
<s> You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
<s> It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
<s> What the hell's a freeway?
<s> That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
<s> That's right, me.
<s> No, no, no... I love my husband.
<s> We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
<s> That's what you woke me up for?
<s> No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
<s> He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
<s> I don't work in Toontown.
<s> Aren't you the lucky one...
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Take it easy.
<s> I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
<s> Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
<s> You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
<s> Yeah, that's better.
<s> Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
<s> My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
<s> Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
<s> Just because you got 'em to laugh?
<s> But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
<s> A Toon?  Noooo.
<s> That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
<s> How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
<s> I rest my case.
<s> I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
<s> And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
<s> [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
<s> Uh? Uh?
<s> Then I'll leave thee.
<s> Am I like Such a fellow?
<s> By my head here come the Capulets.
<s> Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
<s> But new struck cuz.
<s> It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
<s> Of love?
<s> Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
<s> I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
<s> Art thou hurt?
<s> Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
<s> Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
<s> I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
<s> Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
<s> And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
<s> She'll not come down tonight.
<s> Romeo, I drink to thee.
<s> What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
<s> Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
<s> Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
<s> Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
<s> Ay me!
<s> If my heart's dear love--
<s> I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
<s> More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
<s> Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
<s> Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
<s> Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
<s> Well, what was yours?
<s> Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
<s> Thou hast most kindly hit it.
<s> Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
<s> OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
<s> What wouldst thou have with me?
<s> And who are you?
<s> Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
<s> It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
<s> It's been known to happen.
<s> They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
<s> Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
<s> No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
<s> You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
<s> Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
<s> I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
<s> In here...
<s> No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
<s> You'll die if you leave here.
<s> I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
<s> I swear...
<s> I sent it to myself in Paris.
<s> A post office box.
<s> Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
<s> I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
<s> That's it.
<s> Really?
<s> No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
<s> Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
<s> What a surprise...
<s> Eat shit and die slowly...
<s> You should learn a little patience.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> To see a man about a thing.
<s> Jujitsu.
<s> One's a lot more painful than the other.
<s> I do.
<s> So is the woman.
<s> Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
<s> I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
<s> I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
<s> I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
<s> No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
<s> Right now?
<s> I think not.
<s> Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
<s> If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
<s> Just like that?
<s> Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
<s> Do you have a good answer?
<s> Finish it!
<s> What?
<s> You better get some sleep, alright?
<s> I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
<s> Why didn't you kill him?
<s> I'm alright.  And you?
<s> Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
<s> The Russian would be easier.
<s> None of them had any --
<s> I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
<s> Seven thousand...
<s> There must be over a million dollars in here.
<s> Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
<s> Maybe.  Who cares?
<s> All right we will.
<s> Torch it?!
<s> Well, we won't do any of that shit!
<s> What are you gonna do?
<s> You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
<s> It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
<s> All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
<s> If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
<s> Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
<s> Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
<s> That's right.
<s> He killed her...he killed her...
<s> No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
<s> It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
<s> Uh huh.
<s> All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
<s> What are you proposing?
<s> You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
<s> Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
<s> What's that?
<s> It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
<s> Oh.  You coming by tonight?
<s> Are you sure you're OK?
<s> I love you too.
<s> You deserve it is the occasion.
<s> Nothing happened?
<s> Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
<s> I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
<s> First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
<s> We appreciate that.
<s> Don't you think I would have told you that!
<s> What are you getting at?
<s> Dwayne.
<s> Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
<s> Did you say After Midnight?
<s> What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
<s> Well I just uh, you know...
<s> Hmmm...
<s> Have I seen her?
<s> Uh...C?
<s> So be here at three.
<s> I can't hear a word you're saying!
<s> A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
<s> I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
<s> Well you're not getting, either.
<s> You're never getting that much.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
<s> Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
<s> Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
<s> Anything in it?
<s> Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
<s> Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
<s> Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
<s> No, sir.
<s> I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
<s> This is your ship?
<s> I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
<s> I don't think so...
<s> I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
<s> Oh yes, she's very nice.
<s> Those girls drove off because of you.
<s> Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
<s> No.
<s> Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
<s> Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
<s> No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
<s> This is a very dangerous man.
<s> Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
<s> Detective Yu?  Never met him.
<s> Who?
<s> Good at what?
<s> You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
<s> IT IS CRAZY!
<s> You said --
<s> The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
<s> He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
<s> You pull a muscle or something?
<s> She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
<s> What?
<s> There's people up here!
<s> Take it!
<s> We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
<s> She never even looked at you.
<s> Fine by me.
<s> No.
<s> Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
<s> Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
<s> End of the line.
<s> Follow me my Asian brother.
<s> MMMMMM!!!!
<s> I did!
<s> Carter...
<s> It's okay, I got lots more.
<s> The Plaza Hotel?
<s> No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Now you know.
<s> You must come with me for questioning.
<s> The police can protect you.
<s> Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
<s> That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
<s> Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
<s> Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
<s> A little.
<s> I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
<s> I am not responsible for your assumptions.
<s> Did you make the plate?!
<s> What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
<s> Don't go there...
<s> Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
<s> Come on!
<s> Took off. Yes. They took off.
<s> Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
<s> Yee-aww.
<s> No, fish is a PM food.
<s> It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
<s> No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
<s> Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
<s> Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
<s> They put you in charge?
<s> Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
<s> Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
<s> You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
<s> Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
<s> Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
<s> Carter, shut up!
<s> You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
<s> Or somethin'.
<s> Nobody touches me.
<s> I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
<s> I'm waitin' here for a name.
<s> Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
<s> She's fine.
<s> Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
<s> You bet ya, Coach.
<s> Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
<s> How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
<s> Maintain eye contact.
<s> Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
<s> It's hurting.
<s> I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
<s> That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
<s> Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
<s> Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
<s> Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
<s> Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
<s> Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
<s> Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
<s> Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
<s> Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
<s> Are you a reporter?
<s> Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
<s> -- The luau for Maggie.
<s> Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
<s> Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
<s> Without oxygen...
<s> But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
<s> How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
<s> He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
<s> Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
<s> You don't know.
<s> Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
<s> Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
<s> Missed me bad, huh?
<s> Me?
<s> I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
<s> I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
<s> It's probably because you got him fired.
<s> No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
<s> I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
<s> Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
<s> Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
<s> No, I'm just going to head home.
<s> Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
<s> No.  It's my life.
<s> No, you tell her.
<s> You don't love me, is that it?
<s> He's got a houseboat.
<s> No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
<s> Nope.  Not even when I was young.
<s> Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
<s> Go for a walk in Central Park --
<s> I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
<s> It's just like my grandmother's china.
<s> It was my mother's.
<s> So what happened?
<s> Actually, he sounded nice.
<s> No.
<s> Turn on your radio!
<s> The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
<s> That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
<s> That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
<s> Walter and I are engaged!
<s> I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
<s> Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
<s> Magic.
<s> Like... clockwork.
<s> Grace heard it.
<s> The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
<s> I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
<s> It's not that late in Seattle.
<s> It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
<s> He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
<s> I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
<s> It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
<s> Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yeah.  What's that?
<s> Window.
<s> I don't think I have to now.
<s> My feelings exactly.
<s> What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
<s> So I can go.
<s> They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
<s> You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
<s> Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
<s> I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
<s> She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
<s> She's going to cook something for us?
<s> I was thirsty.
<s> The water tastes better in the kitchen.
<s> It's a short word.
<s> Get out.
<s> I was scared of what you were gonna do.
<s> If I didn't go.
<s> Okay.
<s> Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
<s> What about it?
<s> I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
<s> Microwave.  Five minutes.
<s> Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
<s> Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
<s> You look good yourself.
<s> I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
<s> That's none of their affair.
<s> How's it going?
<s> You want 'em all arrested?
<s> It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
<s> It never ends.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They are singing for me.
<s> Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
<s> No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
<s> With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
<s> I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
<s> Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
<s> What?
<s> What has it got me, your union?
<s> I did forget. Luís told me.
<s> I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
<s> Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
<s> Sun up.
<s> Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
<s> Will you be still?
<s> Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
<s> Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
<s> New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
<s> Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
<s> It's possible. Just negotiate.
<s> It's Mama's Saint's Day.
<s> You should have helped her without being asked.
<s> That's it?
<s> The spiders.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
<s> Not even a guess?
<s> You like that?
<s> Now that's down-right insulting.
<s> Everything go?
<s> Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
<s> I was thinking Alice Cooper.
<s> Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
<s> Ouch.
<s> Then leave.
<s> I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
<s> Don't worry. He's out of town.
<s> And you admire that?
<s> I just can't. Okay?
<s> Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
<s> Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
<s> Danny, it's not what you think.
<s> That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
<s> What?
<s> I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
<s> Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
<s> It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
<s> Why's that?
<s> You mean, like to throw 'em off?
<s> Palmdale
<s> I think on account of his nose.
<s> He doesn't have one.
<s> John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
<s> Wait till I tell you what it is.
<s> I can't tell you.
<s> Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
<s> No, I'm good.
<s> Make me an offer.
<s> Hey, okay.
<s> Pull your pants down.
<s> Pull your motherfucking pants down.
<s> Please .. I don't know what you're ...
<s> Okay! Okay!
<s> What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
<s> You go, boy.
<s> Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
<s> When?
<s> Cut the shit, Flynne.
<s> Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
<s> Whata you mean I've got no choice?
<s> For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
<s> Whata you mean?  He told me -
<s> What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
<s> Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?!
<s> Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
<s> Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
<s> Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
<s> You mean the menacing red car?
<s> With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
<s> Thank you.  Thank you very much.
<s> Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
<s> Don't we always take good care of you?
<s> Spit it out, Captain.
<s> In West Fork?
<s> Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
<s> Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
<s> Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
<s> Cap'n...?
<s> I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
<s> Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
<s> They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
<s> Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
<s> Say what, Cap'n?
<s> To each, his own.
<s> That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
<s> Senator's son?
<s> FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
<s> That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
<s> I heard.
<s> A machine gun.
<s> Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
<s> What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
<s> Same place we are.
<s> Those guns are close.
<s> I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
<s> I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
<s> I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
<s> Simpson.
<s> I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
<s> Okay, Wade.  Translators?
<s> Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
<s> Maybe.
<s> They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
<s> How about you shut up and take your position?
<s> Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
<s> I think you're right, Keith.
<s> I know.
<s> We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
<s> Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
<s> No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
<s> Sure, Reiben.
<s> There's to be a bright side, look for it.
<s> Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
<s> Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
<s> I don't like that one.
<s> Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
<s> Have it your way, Captain.
<s> Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
<s> See to it.
<s> I coach the baseball team, too.
<s> Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
<s> We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
<s> Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
<s> I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
<s> What are we likely to run into?
<s> Captain, he's fast!
<s> Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
<s> Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
<s> For going to school?
<s> Good for her.
<s> Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
<s> I'm gonna call her.
<s> Lloyd, give it up.
<s> That's just so embarrassing.
<s> Okay, I got it.
<s> Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
<s> He wants to leave things on a good note.
<s> Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
<s> I can accept that.
<s> Alright.
<s> I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
<s> Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
<s> Okay.
<s> Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
<s> Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
<s> Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
<s> Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
<s> Swear to god.
<s> No, but you stole from them.
<s> You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
<s> Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
<s> Look at those eyes.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah.  What a day.
<s> Pardon me?
<s> You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> It's the worst job since keymaster.
<s> They knew of you.  Now they know you.
<s> Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
<s> Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
<s> Sixteen weeks is a long time.
<s> You think so?
<s> I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
<s> Come on.
<s> Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
<s> Okay, bye, I will.
<s> What did you say?
<s> I just can't have any social life right now.
<s> Am I wrecking my car?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Your letter came yesterday.
<s> Okay.  It's good knowing this.
<s> Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
<s> Just my dad.
<s> You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
<s> I love you.  Please, I love you.
<s> Okay, good, this is all very noble.
<s> Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
<s> Man, you're bringing me down!
<s> Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
<s> How do you pay for one of those?
<s> Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
<s> Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
<s> You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
<s> No way.
<s> How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
<s> Alright.  Key?
<s> I love you too.
<s> Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
<s> He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
<s> I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that.
<s> I pay you too much.
<s> I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
<s> These people, my people, I want my people.
<s> Look -
<s> All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
<s> The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
<s> I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
<s> That's great, thanks.
<s> Things are great, things are great.
<s> Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
<s> Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
<s> Christmas presents.
<s> I think it's too late.
<s> More.
<s> Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
<s> They arrived, can you believe it?
<s> You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
<s> Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
<s> Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
<s> 37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
<s> On national television.
<s> I won't.
<s> Where is everybody?
<s> Why aren't you there?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> No, it's me.
<s> Did you do it?
<s> And much richer as a result.
<s> Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
<s> Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
<s> Not one bit.
<s> She dumped me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
<s> You’re not going to get away with this.
<s> Damned if I know. She ditched me.
<s> I got it..
<s> I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
<s> Until now.
<s> Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
<s> And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
<s> Miss Weathers.
<s> And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
<s> Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
<s> Not good.
<s> Can we turn the light on?
<s> He filmed his victims.
<s> I'll give you one guess.
<s> You're pretty when you're angry.
<s> I'm everywhere.
<s> No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
<s> I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
<s> Where is your attacker?
<s> I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
<s> It's not a good idea, Hallie.
<s> Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
<s> Her old boyfriend?
<s> You're not allowed to ask that.
<s> Thanks, Joel.
<s> Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
<s> Shush.
<s> Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
<s> Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
<s> Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
<s> Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
<s> Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
<s> Do I?
<s> But your voice sounds so familiar.
<s> Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
<s> That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
<s> I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
<s> Closer than you think.
<s> To see your reaction.
<s> I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
<s> It may be Maureen Reynolds --
<s> Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
<s> He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
<s> Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> You mean like, movie trilogies?
<s> All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
<s> Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
<s> Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
<s> What Rielly?
<s> Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
<s> No.
<s> Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
<s> Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
<s> Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
<s> Do you want us to come with you?
<s> Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
<s> Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
<s> I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
<s> What the hell are you doing?
<s> Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
<s> It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
<s> Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
<s> All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
<s> Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
<s> Who's this?
<s> Roman that's not the line.
<s> Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
<s> You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
<s> Well then the people you need to call are the police.
<s> So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
<s> I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
<s> You know it.
<s> That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
<s> I just wanted to see her, that's all.
<s> I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
<s> Now that it's out of your system.
<s> I'm going... I'm going.
<s> Hey, hey, it's just me.
<s> Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
<s> Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
<s> It's okay. We need to talk.
<s> So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
<s> You lost your mom...
<s> Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
<s> We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What's that noise?
<s> Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
<s> Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
<s> Don't...
<s> Or else what?
<s> I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
<s> I believe you...
<s> Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
<s> That all depends on you.
<s> Turn off the light.
<s> I'll even give you a warm up question.
<s> YES!
<s> Please go away! Leave us alone!
<s> No it's not. It was Jason.
<s> It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
<s> We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
<s> We haven't ruled out that possibil...
<s> Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
<s> I'll get my camera.
<s> Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
<s> Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
<s> You're sure it was the Hilton?
<s> We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
<s> Afraid not.
<s> Not yet.
<s> How is everything?
<s> What were you doing out here?
<s> Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
<s> We haven't located her Dad yet.
<s> You think he could still be in town?
<s> I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
<s> Yes, that's right.
<s> I'll send you a copy.
<s> I owe you shit.
<s> Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
<s> I saw him leaving wearing it.
<s> Why would she lie about it?
<s> Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
<s> She's the Scream Queen.
<s> Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
<s> The why'd the police let him go?
<s> And what would be your motive?
<s> I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
<s> He came to make up.
<s> Like you had one.
<s> Do they know who did it?
<s> No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
<s> Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
<s> Later.
<s> Whatever. Just hurry.
<s> It's alright. I'll get it.
<s> Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
<s> And you believe it?
<s> Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
<s> Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
<s> Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
<s> Deal.
<s> I did. He's full of shit.
<s> Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
<s> For once, Stu, drop it.
<s> He's not finished.
<s> Where was the girl?
<s> Turn around.  Hands on your head!
<s> Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
<s> I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
<s> David... please...
<s> Spit it out.
<s> You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
<s> Murderers?
<s> Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
<s> I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
<s> Good.
<s> Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
<s> Hello.
<s> And, if it's a threat.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I know.
<s> A switchblade.
<s> We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
<s> I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
<s> I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
<s> No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
<s> They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
<s> This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
<s> No.
<s> No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
<s> Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
<s> If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
<s> Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
<s> I don't.  Neither do you.
<s> We're focusing.
<s> The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
<s> These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
<s> How can you say that?  Especially after today?
<s> You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
<s> Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
<s> No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
<s> One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
<s> He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
<s> What are you talking about?  What happened?
<s> I can't let you do this...
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> What?
<s> High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
<s> It surprises me.  It really does.
<s> You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
<s> Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
<s> He mentioned it.
<s> I hate this city.
<s> An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
<s> Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
<s> It was, I tell you!
<s> This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
<s> Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
<s> Yes sir...
<s> Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
<s> Just keep goin'...
<s> Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
<s> Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
<s> JOINT action?
<s> Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
<s> Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
<s> <U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
<s> You've done a lot of growin'...
<s> No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
<s> Because she's my...my...
<s> I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
<s> Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
<s> But I just bought a good blanket.
<s> Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
<s> She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
<s> Nine...  Ten!
<s> What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
<s> You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
<s> I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
<s> Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
<s> Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
<s> You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
<s> I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
<s> No...not yet...
<s> Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
<s> Finish your breakfast...
<s> I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
<s> You crazy?
<s> You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
<s> "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
<s> Oh God, Tommi...
<s> They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
<s> Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
<s> We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
<s> We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
<s> Do you have a better idea?
<s> Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
<s> And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
<s> Someone from the village.
<s> What? What am I supposed to sense?
<s> Hi, darling.
<s> This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
<s> ...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
<s> Does this dog here belong to you?
<s> It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
<s> Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
<s> There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
<s> Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
<s> Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
<s> Right you are, governor!
<s> My Massacre at Paris is complete.
<s> Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
<s> Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
<s> When I have fifty pounds.
<s> I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
<s> It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
<s> Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
<s> Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
<s> She is always Aphrodite.
<s> What piece? Richard Crookback?
<s> Who wrote that?
<s> Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
<s> We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
<s> We are about to embark on a great voyage.
<s> God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
<s> Go on.
<s> The daughter of his enemy.
<s> "Of love?"
<s> Verona again.
<s> I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
<s> And I love poetry above all.
<s> "Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
<s> But the plague
<s> I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
<s> A lowly player.
<s> Oh, not for the world!
<s> Can you love a player?
<s> Oh
<s> You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
<s> Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
<s> You lie.
<s> I was the more deceived.
<s> You cannot marry Wessex!
<s> Orsino…good name
<s> and thus unable to declare her love
<s> Write me well.
<s> So my lord? I speak with him every day.
<s> The Queen has consented?
<s> It is not my riding day, my lord.
<s> Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
<s> Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
<s> Does she say so?
<s> I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
<s> I don't know -- Campbell or something?
<s> I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
<s> Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
<s> I don't have time.
<s> I'm only asking you both to think about it.
<s> Then what? Who's going to do what?
<s> Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
<s> Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Security.
<s> They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
<s> They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
<s> It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
<s> I don't know.
<s> That's because he is. Does that upset you?
<s> Take another look at these two.
<s> Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
<s> I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
<s> What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
<s> Alex.
<s> Not usually this drunk.
<s> -- which is a hack.
<s> No, Alex, we don't really love you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Don't look?
<s> For ever and ever.
<s> Who?
<s> Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
<s> Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
<s> It's the only way.
<s> You're frightened.
<s> I'll wait there.
<s> Everything.
<s> I see.
<s> did you hear anything before he cries?
<s> Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
<s> Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
<s> No, three. Who said there were four?
<s> Yes, absolutely.
<s> I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
<s> Yeah, that's right, that's it.
<s> OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> Eh --
<s> You must be Juliet.
<s> Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
<s> It's a breeze.
<s> No.
<s> And what do you recognize, names or faces?
<s> Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
<s> It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
<s> Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
<s> No, it's a very groovy girl.
<s> Yes, but... I thought...
<s> What do you expect me to do about it?
<s> Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
<s> That's okay too.
<s> Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
<s> It turned out to be cancer.
<s> -- What?
<s> I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
<s> I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
<s> I hope she's all right.
<s> I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
<s> I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
<s> Hello, George.
<s> Right now, I just don't care.
<s> Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> No thanks.
<s> No thanks.
<s> You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
<s> Great.
<s> Right, that's right.
<s> Well, yeah... you know.
<s> Buffums?
<s> Great. Who's been doing your hair?
<s> -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
<s> He's a very private person, actually.
<s> Do you? You still see him?
<s> I won't screw you up.
<s> What?
<s> Hey, I don't tell.
<s> You did, didn't you?
<s> You did, I know you did.
<s> You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> -- this guy with Jill.
<s> Sweetheart, you're drunk.
<s> -- what?
<s> We're friends.
<s> -- we are?
<s> That's it, then I'm leaving.
<s> She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
<s> Wanda...
<s> -- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
<s> I don't know if you don't know --
<s> -- oh -- sweetheart...
<s> -- how did you get here?
<s> Hey, baby, what's happening?
<s> George, I don't --
<s> I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
<s> What about me?
<s> I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
<s> Hey, baby, what's happening?
<s> Great.
<s> Hello.
<s> Going where?
<s> Honey, have they offered you the job?
<s> Your advice!
<s> Commercials.
<s> -- what?  -- I'll see you later...
<s> I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Where did this come from?
<s> Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
<s> How many?
<s> I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
<s> ... honest. At least you're honest with me.
<s> Yeah, I know. Did you?
<s> But Mr. Norman said --
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> I know what you mean.
<s> What about, tonight?
<s> Oh, hey...
<s> -- yeah?
<s> Yeah.  How long have you been here?
<s> Well, what?
<s> Now wait a minute...
<s> We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
<s> Okay, thanks.
<s> Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
<s> No --
<s> No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What was it, somebody's daughter?
<s> -- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
<s> What's that?
<s> Fine.
<s> Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
<s> Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
<s> I guess not.
<s> Well, it's George.
<s> I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
<s> I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
<s> Well, there was this one time --
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> -- these bastards have me hemmed in.
<s> You're going.
<s> I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
<s> No.
<s> -- we're going to be here all night.
<s> Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
<s> What was the Donner party?
<s> Okay.
<s> No.
<s> I'm not supposed to.
<s> Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
<s> You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
<s> All right.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
<s> Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
<s> Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> He is, Mr. Torrance.
<s> Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
<s> Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
<s> It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> I'm a Wendy.
<s> Good.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
<s> Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
<s> Thank you for saying so.
<s> Good evening Mr. Torrance.
<s> Your money's no good here.
<s> Hi, hon.  How's it going?
<s> Uh...huh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> How do you like it?
<s> Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
<s> Wendy!
<s> I'm not going to hurt you.
<s> Give me the bat.
<s> Stop swinging the bat.
<s> Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
<s> Well, that sounds fine to me.
<s> shut in together over long periods of time.
<s> put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
<s> Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
<s> Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
<s> Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
<s> Where's Mom?
<s> Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
<s> A tracer. You'll like it.
<s> I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
<s> I told you!
<s> What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
<s> Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
<s> Really?
<s> LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
<s> We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
<s> Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
<s> You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
<s> What did who say?
<s> Today was the deadline, Vince.
<s> You did what?
<s> You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
<s> You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
<s> That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
<s> Oh-huh.
<s> Oh my! 
<s> No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
<s> Not in years.
<s> Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
<s> The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
<s> Because we're
<s> This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
<s> Um, I don't really know this one...
<s> You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
<s> I knew that.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> You know?  About me?  About everything?
<s> I... I...
<s> Three years.  Sister.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> She won't?  Why not?
<s> Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
<s> Now you.
<s> This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
<s> Don't you know it!
<s> What did He say?
<s> Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
<s> Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
<s> You mean black people?
<s> What's a concubine?
<s> Would you like that?
<s> Yes.  Until breakfast.
<s> It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
<s> Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
<s> I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
<s> I am?
<s> What?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
<s> You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
<s> He didn't do you a favor.
<s> Then-you run.
<s> Maybe Hawaii.
<s> It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
<s> But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
<s> I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
<s> Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
<s> She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
<s> Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
<s> You're supposed to be hiding out!
<s> Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
<s> Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
<s> You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
<s> Hail, Mary.
<s> Really.
<s> Take care of it.
<s> It didn't happen.
<s> Where is she?
<s> And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
<s> Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
<s> Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
<s> It's better than ice cream.
<s> Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
<s> It's no use.  She just isn't here.
<s> We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
<s> A Benedictine.
<s> But where?
<s> Yes?
<s> This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
<s> How did you hear this?
<s> What is that?
<s> ... Brom Bones...
<s> Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
<s> Does that look like an animal hanging?
<s> He drowned.  Anyone could see.
<s> Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
<s> Chosen me?
<s> Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
<s> No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
<s> I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
<s> What happened?
<s> Should we go back?
<s> "Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
<s> We should go.
<s> Man or woman?
<s> Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
<s> Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
<s> Lady Van Tassel.
<s> Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
<s> You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
<s> I doubt that's the end.
<s> The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
<s> May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
<s> I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
<s> Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
<s> If you want.  But...
<s> That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
<s> They have done nothing of the sort.
<s> To avenge his father, and the others.
<s> Katrina.  Why do you follow?
<s> A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Come with me.
<s> Let her go!
<s> I didn't see none.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Yes.  Here...
<s> The Horseman.  Yes.
<s> Doctor, he is awake.
<s> Father saw you die.
<s> I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
<s> I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
<s> Is him stayin' here workin' out?
<s> I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
<s> What you got that's good to eat?
<s> How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
<s> I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
<s> I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
<s> Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
<s> No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
<s> Don't tell me what to do.
<s> You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
<s> Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
<s> That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
<s> It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
<s> Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
<s> How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
<s> What numbers do you punch?
<s> Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
<s> I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
<s> Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
<s> How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
<s> Why did he do that, reckon.
<s> They ort to. You're a good boy.
<s> You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
<s> He ain't no count.
<s> I don't reckon I know.
<s> My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
<s> I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
<s> Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
<s> We'll be on teams, me and you?
<s> Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
<s> I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
<s> You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
<s> Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
<s> Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
<s> He ain't ever okay to me.
<s> Did Karl go to bed?
<s> Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
<s> Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
<s> I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
<s> Me, too.
<s> I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
<s> Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> My history.
<s> Tolerable, I reckon.
<s> Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
<s> All right then.
<s> I could shore use some. Thank ye.
<s> Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
<s> Ma'am?
<s> You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
<s> Did you knock on the door yet?
<s> Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
<s> Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
<s> I wouldn't never hurt them.
<s> Can I help you, sir?
<s> No, we have to get this story.
<s> No thank you.
<s> Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
<s> Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
<s> Signs?
<s> You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
<s> Actually, I'm his father.
<s> Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
<s> Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
<s> It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
<s> I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
<s> What's that, Sol?
<s> Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
<s> The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
<s> You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
<s> No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
<s> I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
<s> Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
<s> It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
<s> It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
<s> It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
<s> Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
<s> Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
<s> Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
<s> You got it.
<s> I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
<s> I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
<s> Anything for art, eh, Paul?
<s> Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
<s> This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
<s> Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
<s> Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
<s> You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
<s> Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
<s> You what?
<s> I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
<s> Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
<s> I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
<s> Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
<s> They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> Huh?
<s> I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
<s> And these?
<s> How the hell did you get into the building?
<s> Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
<s> I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
<s> Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
<s> And you told your nephew about it?
<s> I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
<s> Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
<s> Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
<s> I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
<s> Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
<s> It's me, honey. It's Mom.
<s> I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
<s> I owe you something.
<s> Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
<s> Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
<s> Is your father an artist?
<s> Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
<s> I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
<s> It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
<s> I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
<s> I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
<s> I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
<s> Why don't you go to the police?
<s> If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
<s> Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
<s> Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
<s> One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
<s> Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
<s> That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
<s> No way.
<s> The end.
<s> Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
<s> Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
<s> Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
<s> Yeah, I picked it up.
<s> It wasn't my fault.
<s> The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
<s> I suppose so. He never told me about it.
<s> I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
<s> It's all right. I really do know them.
<s> Yes, please.
<s> ...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
<s> Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
<s> In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
<s> Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
<s> A thousand.
<s> You done your math right.
<s> Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
<s> All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
<s> Well, what if?
<s> Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
<s> So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
<s> It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
<s> I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
<s> Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
<s> Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
<s> Pretty darn clear.
<s> Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
<s> That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<s> Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
<s> He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
<s> Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
<s> No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
<s> It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
<s> Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
<s> Still lashed to the mast.
<s> Maybe...?
<s> But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
<s> He hit his head.  On the way in.
<s> A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
<s> It is.
<s> Apparently.
<s> Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
<s> As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
<s> Obviously.
<s> Not in those words.
<s> That's all he said.
<s> That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
<s> Such as?
<s> Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
<s> It's entirely mutual.
<s> Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
<s> How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
<s> No we're not.
<s> Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
<s> What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
<s> I thought you weren't talking to me.
<s> Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
<s> But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
<s> Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
<s> Shave our legs, stupid.
<s> Watch it, Daphne!
<s> I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
<s> Fight it.
<s> It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
<s> And I'm not even pretty.
<s> But this is so humiliating.
<s> What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
<s> I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
<s> You - you -
<s> Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
<s> Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
<s> Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
<s> No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
<s> I am.
<s> His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
<s> Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
<s> Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
<s> Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
<s> There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
<s> I'll say.
<s> Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
<s> We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
<s> That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
<s> Well, I'll come back later.
<s> Do you suppose she went out shopping?
<s> I hope so.
<s> You like it?
<s> Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
<s> Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
<s> Me too.  Bye now.
<s> I'm not surprised.
<s> Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
<s> Bull fiddle.
<s> Why?
<s> Yes, Osgood?
<s> Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
<s> Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
<s> Why?
<s> William Morris!
<s> You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
<s> No - funerals.
<s> If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
<s> Where did he conduct?
<s> I'm not very bright, I guess.
<s> I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
<s> Have you ever been with a male band?
<s> You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
<s> Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
<s> What's in Florida?
<s> Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
<s> Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
<s> Why?
<s> You're society girls?
<s> Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
<s> Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
<s> I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
<s> If it's at all possible -
<s> Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
<s> It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
<s> Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
<s> Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
<s> Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
<s> It's all right for a bachelor.
<s> Oh - a member of the herring family.
<s> Bon voyage.
<s> Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
<s> It's the crews' night off.
<s> Completely.
<s> Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
<s> They just sort of leave me cold.
<s> Oh, you couldn't possibly.
<s> All right - if you insist.
<s> I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
<s> Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
<s> It's like smoking without inhaling.
<s> Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
<s> I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
<s> I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
<s> I told you - I'm not very bright.
<s> I come to the old lady's funeral.
<s> Booze.
<s> Go where?
<s> Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
<s> I cut myself shaving.
<s> Spats Colombo.
<s> I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
<s> So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
<s> No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
<s> Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
<s> Are you sure you’re okay?
<s> So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
<s> It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
<s> What for?
<s> Oh, don’t be that way.
<s> Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
<s> Sorry, can you give us a moment?
<s> Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
<s> Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
<s> It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
<s> Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
<s> I slept with your sister.
<s> You have feet?
<s> It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
<s> I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
<s> This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
<s> Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
<s> Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
<s> No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
<s> Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
<s> He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
<s> Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
<s> I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
<s> Just drunk enough.
<s> I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
<s> You don't live around here, do you?
<s> That's where we come from first?
<s> Sure--
<s> What do that mean?
<s> :The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
<s> NO! N-O, NO!
<s> I did look, Charlie, but I--
<s> Yes, sir...
<s> We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
<s> Hi, Daddy...
<s> Goodnight to you, son...
<s> Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
<s> My father taught me...
<s> Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
<s> Yes mam...
<s> You sure can, son...
<s> He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
<s> It's the heat.
<s> No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
<s> Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
<s> Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
<s> Might be...
<s> I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
<s> Mornin'...
<s> Little chilly.
<s> Ike, you could make a song outta that!
<s> Is there something I can do to help you?
<s> It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
<s> Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
<s> You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
<s> Will they give him a trial?
<s> Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
<s> Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
<s> Pillow.
<s> I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
<s> Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
<s> I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
<s> More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
<s> WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
<s> Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
<s> Sure, hon. Goodnight.
<s> You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
<s> Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
<s> This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
<s> Something big, children.
<s> No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
<s> Mph rm.
<s> Mrph mprph!!
<s> Dude, what the hell is going on?
<s> FREEZE!!
<s> Kay.
<s> Oh... Alright, back you go.
<s> Kyle, check it out.
<s> We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
<s> Where do they come up with this stuff?!
<s> Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
<s> Our moms suck!
<s> No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
<s> Me?!
<s> Are you sure, Kenny?
<s> We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
<s> -Or monkey fucker-
<s> Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
<s> Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
<s> Hello, Brooke Shields!
<s> This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
<s> Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
<s> Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
<s> I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
<s> I know.
<s> Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
<s> THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
<s> Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
<s> You didn't?
<s> <b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
<s> Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
<s> Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
<s> Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
<s> They're not going to make it!
<s> My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
<s> So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
<s> Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
<s> I'm sure I will.
<s> Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
<s> I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
<s> And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
<s> Well it's a good thing that I did.
<s> Uh...
<s> What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
<s> Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
<s> I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
<s> Like that piece of ass he was with.
<s> I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
<s> Like open an airlock by mistake?
<s> Close every door behind you!
<s> Words to live by.
<s> Helllp!
<s> The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
<s> You too.
<s> I'm about to blow the wall.
<s> How does the distress signal look?
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
<s> It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
<s> Is there anything I can help you with?
<s> He's in the bathroom.
<s> Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
<s> Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
<s> How am I supposed to know?
<s> Talk to him...Jesus...
<s> Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
<s> Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
<s> Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
<s> Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
<s> Find your bowler?
<s> Nope.
<s> It belonged to my dad.
<s> I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
<s> What do you want with old man Faz?
<s> You afraid we're gonna steal it?
<s> Are you guys bruddas?
<s> I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
<s> La da da dalala...
<s> It was a clearance.
<s> I'd buy it!
<s> Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
<s> I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
<s> Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
<s> You knew her. You married her in 1963.
<s> You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
<s> I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
<s> Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
<s> What's it look like to you?
<s> You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
<s> I'm your blood.
<s> That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
<s> I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
<s> See ya 'round Maynard.
<s> Clam it!
<s> He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
<s> Millie, I know what I'm doing.
<s> I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
<s> It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
<s> Who's there?
<s> You shouldn't touch her.
<s> Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
<s> You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
<s> It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
<s> If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
<s> Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
<s> That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
<s> If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
<s> What ever happened to just bowling?
<s> I like the sport the way it is.
<s> See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
<s> Look who's talking!
<s> Bowling "Center"!
<s> That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
<s> Line up where you want it.
<s> Now swing it out a little to the right...
<s> Where can I find him?
<s> I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
<s> The mental hospital.
<s> Not while I'm in training.
<s> I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
<s> He said he'd sponsor me.
<s> Nothing.
<s> He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
<s> Sheila, please.
<s> Why should I help that old fuck.
<s> Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
<s> You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
<s> It?
<s> I feel sick.
<s> When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
<s> I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
<s> What about plan C?
<s> I'm looking for somebody.
<s> Your time is up, busyboy.
<s> It's burning...
<s> I can't...
<s> I said back away.
<s> What is it?
<s> Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
<s> That's our reserve air.
<s> The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
<s> Press?  No, I haven't.
<s> Storm?  What storm?
<s> A thousand feet.
<s> What?
<s> Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
<s> Hold on --
<s> It's impossible.
<s> I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
<s> I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
<s> ... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
<s> Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
<s> You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
<s> Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
<s> They're coming.
<s> What the hell is going on here?
<s> I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
<s> It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
<s> Please watch your closest monitor...
<s> She's not gonna know.
<s> Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
<s> What are you going to do -- shoot her?
<s> Get this thing off me.
<s> Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
<s> My gosh, Norman.
<s> They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
<s> They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
<s> Beth --
<s> Beth.
<s> So what?
<s> It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
<s> What?
<s> We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
<s> Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
<s> I would.  But my suit --
<s> You don't trust me?
<s> Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
<s> We must've had it delivered then.
<s> You think?
<s> I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
<s> What do you mean, a part of Harry?
<s> Which I told Barnes was attacking --
<s> Something for burns.
<s> Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
<s> Bingo.
<s> Antihistamine.  For bites.
<s> How do you spell it?
<s> Beth --
<s> For what?
<s> What do you mean, different?
<s> Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
<s> Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
<s> C'mon -- what?
<s> Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
<s> When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
<s> You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
<s> It's not safe for you to be either.
<s> From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
<s> Beth -- gimme the gun.
<s> What?
<s> Hear what?
<s> Beth --
<s> What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
<s> Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
<s> You'd have to ask them.
<s> Just in time for what?
<s> Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
<s> To what?
<s> I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
<s> A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
<s> What noise?
<s> You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
<s> What is it, Harry?
<s> Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
<s> I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
<s> Wisconsin?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
<s> I'm trying to keep balance with --
<s> Nine hundred feet to surface.
<s> Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
<s> Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
<s> Think about it.
<s> The ships?
<s> They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
<s> What was that, sir?
<s> Huh?
<s> This is like nursery school.
<s> Unless it's an act.
<s> When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
<s> Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Four.  Four years --
<s> Who's going to pay me then?
<s> A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
<s> Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
<s> Is that good or bad?
<s> There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
<s> Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
<s> Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
<s> Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
<s> Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
<s> We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
<s> Why?
<s> All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
<s> Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
<s> No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
<s> I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
<s> Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
<s> That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
<s> I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
<s> It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
<s> Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
<s> What do I want with a scar ?
<s> What about it, Diz ?
<s> Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
<s> Sir, no, sir.
<s> You got it bad.
<s> Your father will never let you.
<s> If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
<s> The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
<s> I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
<s> They revoke our flight status.
<s> Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
<s> Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
<s> Zander, please... Let's go !
<s> You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
<s> So who's got time to get married ?
<s> Excuse me...!
<s> Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know, Zander.
<s> Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
<s> I don't want everyone to see.
<s> How do I know if this is love ?
<s> Yeah, sure, I guess.
<s> You two have so much in common.
<s> I don't even know if you're my girl.
<s> He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
<s> I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
<s> What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
<s> I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
<s> What happened to your eye ?
<s> See you on the bounce !
<s> Thank you, ma'am.
<s> Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
<s> Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
<s> Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
<s> How come we never got together ?
<s> Sure.
<s> No thanks, Diz.
<s> I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
<s> I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
<s> What ?
<s> I'm on it !
<s> All bands.
<s> We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
<s> A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
<s> It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
<s> Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
<s> Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
<s> Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
<s> Keep trying, Sergeant.
<s> He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
<s> I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
<s> This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
<s> This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
<s> The Rodger Young just burned up...
<s> SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
<s> What is it, Rico ?
<s> Good for you. Go find out.
<s> Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
<s> Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
<s> To join with him.
<s> You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
<s> More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
<s> It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
<s> -- You, personally, are assuming command?
<s> May I ask Why?
<s> No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
<s> Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
<s> The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
<s> Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
<s> Captain... I'd like to go along...
<s> Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
<s> It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
<s> That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
<s> It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
<s> A tractor beam...
<s> Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
<s> Impact in fifteen seconds...
<s> Viewer, standard ahead.
<s> That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
<s> Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
<s> Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
<s> Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
<s> Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
<s> And whatever you sensed out here....
<s> Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
<s> Any reply from them?
<s> I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
<s> I am seeking answers, Captain.
<s> That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
<s> Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
<s> We're ready, sir.
<s> I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
<s> Sure plan to.
<s> He'll eat potroast and like it.

<s> I know, I know.
<s> We, we have to give it.
<s> What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
<s> The minute I read that script I said...
<s> ...she has a <u>home</u>...
<s> Yes.
<s> Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
<s> Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...

<s> No.  No, but we're planning to.

<s> You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
<s> We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
<s> I have to talk to you.  My wife...
<s> Did you, where are we going tonight...?
<s> Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
<s> I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
<s> I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
<s> I don't drink.
<s> I'm out.
<s> I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
<s> No.
<s> You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
<s> My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
<s> That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
<s> Sherry, Sherry...
<s> That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...

<s> Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
<s> I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
<s> I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
<s> Excellent point.
<s> It happens.
<s> I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
<s> Sex.  Of course.
<s> What are you gonna talk about?
<s> Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
<s> She is but an arriviste.
<s> Mom?  What's wrong?
<s> I'll miss you so much.
<s> But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
<s> Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
<s> See, I...
<s> That doesn't bother me.
<s> Suits me <u>fine</u>!
<s> There you are!
<s> Annabelle put down that camera.
<s> Cos she loves you.
<s> Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
<s> How could I be?  We learned some magic...
<s> Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
<s> I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
<s> No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
<s> Yes...if you like big hair...
<s> Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
<s> Pray.  We never find out.
<s> I'm still sick, but I'm better.
<s> Rache says it's from you.
<s> So where are you?
<s> At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
<s> Remarried.  There is no move.
<s> I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
<s> Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
<s> Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
<s> To make it easier for them or you?
<s> It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
<s> Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
<s> No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
<s> Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
<s> You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
<s> You're not terribly good at taking care of h...

<s> Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
<s> Anxiety.
<s> I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
<s> Don't flatter yourself.
<s> Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
<s> It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
<s> Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
<s> I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...

<s> I trust you of course I do but --
<s> Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
<s> Well, they will be.
<s> That's not us.
<s> How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> It was God's will.
<s> No.
<s> I'm still poor.
<s> I'm always working.
<s> This is work.
<s> My Jesus…
<s> It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
<s> Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
<s> You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
<s> OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
<s> Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
<s> Yes, Mikey?
<s> How was the class?
<s> Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
<s> Don't be so upset. It's OK...
<s> Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
<s> You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
<s> Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
<s> Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
<s> The same.
<s> Just the same.
<s> Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
<s> Sure, Dad.
<s> No.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Say, Ni...
<s> ...gger.
<s> 'Fuck me hard!'
<s> Again!!
<s> C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
<s> Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
<s> Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
<s> Maybe she has caller ID.
<s> Thanks.
<s> HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
<s> Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
<s> He did?
<s> Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
<s> Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
<s> Y-yes--
<s> I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
<s> I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
<s> You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
<s> No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
<s> It's nothing to worry about.
<s> Where does it lead?
<s> Like where--in your dreams?
<s> I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
<s> Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
<s> How much of this shit do they have, White!!
<s> You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
<s> Moffo!
<s> Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
<s> That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
<s> Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
<s> You mean you'll tell us his name???
<s> See!  See, I told you.
<s> What?
<s> Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
<s> That's government property, Major.
<s> General Schmuck?
<s> What kind of trouble?
<s> I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
<s> Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
<s> I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
<s> Do you recognize my voice?
<s> Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> You're right, sir.
<s> No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
<s> Just a squirt.
<s> Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
<s> When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
<s> I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
<s> You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
<s> Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
<s> Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
<s> Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
<s> What the hell is Plan-R?
<s> Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
<s> They're coming in now.
<s> Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
<s> They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
<s> Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
<s> War?
<s> Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.

<s> Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
<s> Sure, I'll take her up right now.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Ready, Major.
<s> Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
<s> Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
<s> Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
<s> Check, ten thousand air burst.
<s> Hell, he looks dead.
<s> But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
<s> Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
<s> Let me check.
<s> I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
<s> But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
<s> "Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure, all the time, in Group.
<s> Intense.
<s> Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
<s> Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.

<s> What did you guys think?
<s> I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
<s> Typical male.
<s> Hey, you said you did a video?
<s> Oh. Well, what's it on?
<s> Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
<s> I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
<s> And your mom.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You wanna bet he's with a girl?
<s> Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
<s> Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
<s> So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
<s> No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
<s> No, I'm not worried.
<s> Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
<s> Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
<s> Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
<s> She's in the van.
<s> Come on.
<s> Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
<s> So, how was the ride, kids?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, that's one way of putting it.
<s> We're your customers. We're not complaining.
<s> Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
<s> No, no, whoa!
<s> You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
<s> Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
<s> "Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
<s> A reel?
<s> I didn't want to eat this much, man.
<s> Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
<s> Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
<s> Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
<s> And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking.

<s> What'd he get you?
<s> Mm.
<s> What was your name again?
<s> Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
<s> Funny shit, man.
<s> Mm-mm.
<s> Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
<s> Because I'm alienated.
<s> Who were you talking to?
<s> Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
<s> Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
<s> Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
<s> What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> That chick, Erica?
<s> Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
<s> Just go home, alright?
<s> Okay. Nazeer, okay?
<s> I hate that.
<s> Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
<s> About what?
<s> Tim!
<s> It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I would've stopped it.
<s> Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
<s> Us.
<s> So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
<s> I don't know.
<s> No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
<s> God, you smell like whiskey.
<s> Is that a threat?
<s> 'Bye, Jeff.
<s> Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
<s> We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
<s> Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
<s> No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
<s> It's pretty exciting.
<s> Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
<s> Hey.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Mine too.
<s> If...
<s> Yep.
<s> I think I gotta go.
<s> "I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"

<s> Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
<s> Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
<s> Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
<s> Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
<s> There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive.

<s> Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
<s> If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
<s> Of course - of course!  Hands in...
<s> Jack...
<s> Mmm-hmmm...
<s> That was gas, Sweetie.
<s> What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...

<s> Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
<s> But you're not married.
<s> Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.

<s> Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
<s> Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?

<s> The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
<s> I'll take it.
<s> I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
<s> What's wrong with it?
<s> Nothing for Ladd?
<s> I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
<s> Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
<s> As for instance?
<s> Life can be beautiful!
<s> You don't know how glad I am to see youl
<s> You did?
<s> I tell you this is half sold.
<s> See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
<s> This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
<s> I'll make it short.
<s> I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
<s> Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
<s> We're engaged.
<s> You're tough, all right.
<s> Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
<s> Second generation, huh?
<s> Twenty-two.
<s> Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
<s> This is where you live?
<s> That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
<s> No.
<s> That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
<s> I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
<s> Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
<s> Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
<s> Get out!
<s> Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
<s> Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
<s> Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
<s> The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
<s> Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
<s> It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
<s> What's wrong with It?
<s> 
<s> Come here!
<s> Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
<s> There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
<s> A little.
<s> It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
<s> Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
<s> Maybe deMille is shooting.
<s> All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
<s> I haven't done anything, Norma.
<s> These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
<s> De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
<s> Go on in.
<s> Wipe your feet!
<s> Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
<s> Naturally.  I brought them myself.
<s> I'm not here.
<s> She is upstairs.
<s> That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
<s> It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
<s> She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
<s> It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
<s> Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
<s> It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
<s> More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
<s> Frankly, no.
<s> Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.

<s> Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
<s> Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
<s> Who?
<s> Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
<s> Thank you, Max.
<s> It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
<s> Softball.
<s> It's what we were warned about.
<s> Eliminate her.
<s> The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
<s> Whatever you say.
<s> Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
<s> Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
<s> We have to have a long talk about all this.
<s> Yes. It reminds me of home.
<s> Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
<s> No.
<s> It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
<s> Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
<s> What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
<s> Just like that?
<s> But I don't understand.
<s> Hello. Are you still mad at me?
<s> I don't see why not.
<s> Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
<s> What?
<s> She has hostages.
<s> I'll come back as soon as I can.
<s> Do you want to come to Argo City?
<s> You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
<s> Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
<s> Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
<s> You vicious--
<s> Well...I guess I can't.
<s> Can I quote you?
<s> Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
<s> -- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> Did anybody notice you?
<s> I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
<s> You bet your ass.
<s> This is all your clothes?
<s> I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
<s> Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
<s> I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
<s> You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
<s> Cigarette?
<s> Throw him out.
<s> We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
<s> It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
<s> Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
<s> What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
<s> Why?
<s> Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
<s> Buddy, are we in trouble.
<s> Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
<s> For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
<s> Clark.
<s> Too much mayonnaise?
<s> Me neither...
<s> Call me.
<s> Me too. That's why I put this one up.
<s> Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
<s> Kent!
<s> Mom and I do this all the time.
<s> I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
<s> I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
<s> What's that?
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
<s> Decaffeinated too?
<s> Columbia.
<s> That what they call you?
<s> Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
<s> Just the man I wanted to see!
<s> Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
<s> What will it do?
<s> It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
<s> Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
<s> I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
<s> Watch out for them air pockets!
<s> Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
<s> Anytime.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
<s> Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
<s> The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
<s> No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
<s> In other words, push this red button.
<s> Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
<s> You've got to pick three more numbers.
<s> Hello.
<s> He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
<s> Where did it come from?
<s> A normal person.
<s> Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
<s> Do I detect a note of jealousy?
<s> Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
<s> That's because you can hardly see through those things.
<s> I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
<s> What??
<s> Let's go to my place.
<s> Say you love me.
<s> Oh, hi.
<s> Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
<s> Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
<s> What else is ballast for?
<s> A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
<s> You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
<s> Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
<s> Good. My heart can't take it.
<s> Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
<s> It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
<s> Wrong.
<s> That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
<s> He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
<s> Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
<s> Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
<s> I asked the right question.
<s> I want my Liberace record back tonight.
<s> Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
<s> Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
<s> Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
<s> Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
<s> I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
<s> Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
<s> Free!
<s> Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
<s> What shall we do now?
<s> Yes?
<s> Sentimental idiot.
<s> I really don't think . . .
<s> And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
<s> Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
<s> This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
<s> No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
<s> I'm sorry to see you go.
<s> That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
<s> I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
<s> I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
<s> It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
<s> Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
<s> Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
<s> Mr. White, come with me I want to see
<s> Daddy . . . ?
<s> Stuff it.
<s> Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
<s> He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
<s> Get the box, nephew.
<s> There!
<s> What?
<s> You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
<s> First, I have fun.
<s> What do you fear?
<s> Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
<s> Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
<s> Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
<s> He's thirty-five years old.
<s> Thank you.
<s> We're running out of smoke.
<s> Albert!
<s> Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
<s> Lois isn't here?
<s> No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
<s> Not really, no.
<s> Oh.
<s> Don't you ever give up?
<s> Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
<s> Not unless you can fly.
<s> It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
<s> Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
<s> Jealous? Of what?
<s> You're not the only one.
<s> Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
<s> Okay.  Take me to your leader.
<s> So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
<s> I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
<s> Tough guy, huh?
<s> I didn't say a word.
<s> I read the article.
<s> Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
<s> I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
<s> You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
<s> Ready.
<s> You?! How about me?
<s> 'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
<s> On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
<s> He'll be weightless.
<s> He will be odd, different.
<s> How good it felt!
<s> Twenty-four.
<s> Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
<s> Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
<s> Right on the first guess.
<s> Ask, You're the girl reporter.
<s> You think they're strange?
<s> I guess they are a little odd.
<s> It's not bad.
<s> Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
<s> It's a Twinkie, boss.
<s> Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
<s> Of time, Luthor.
<s> Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
<s> We'll see how fast I can fly.
<s> I'd heard that.  But she's well?
<s> Are you still in touch?
<s> I'll tell her that.
<s> The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
<s> Why?
<s> Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
<s> So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
<s> That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
<s> I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
<s> Can't you make it later?
<s> A while.
<s> Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
<s> You believe that?
<s> Well I don't.
<s> You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
<s> What do you mean by that, Dolores?
<s> And they loved Bear.
<s> Berries.
<s> Were his parents...attentive to him?
<s> What's that, Dolores?
<s> Why would he be frightened?
<s> Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
<s> I didn't say that.
<s> Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
<s> How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
<s> I'll...take it straight.
<s> Summer's over.  It's fall.
<s> No.  What's this lawyer business?
<s> Did he say what about?
<s> That's what he said.
<s> What's a ditty again?
<s> Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
<s> Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
<s> The people in the town?
<s> So he was mean?
<s> So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
<s> At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
<s> What do they do?
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> 'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
<s> Daddy?
<s> You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
<s> You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
<s> Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
<s> What is it?
<s> Is there shrimp on it?
<s> Well, let's see what we get.
<s> You've been retained?
<s> Who did they get for that?
<s> It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
<s> No.
<s> In what way?
<s> Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
<s> Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
<s> And where did you sit that morning?
<s> And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
<s> Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> Seventy-two miles an hour.
<s> Yes.
<s> You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
<s> Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Very slick.
<s> My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
<s> How will he do that?
<s> I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Thanks, I see him...
<s> The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
<s> Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
<s> Give me a chance --
<s> Why, has he bothered you before?
<s> Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
<s> Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
<s> Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
<s> History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
<s> I thought we were talking about Sidney?
<s> We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
<s> I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
<s> What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
<s> Can't hurt...
<s> Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
<s> How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
<s> The man in jail is always for freedom.
<s> J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
<s> No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
<s> In his apartment -
<s> That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
<s> And he's a perfect stranger to me.
<s> I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
<s> Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
<s> He wants me to break a leg?
<s> It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
<s> It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
<s> I'm used to you...
<s> Nothing...
<s> That's no way to talk...
<s> Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
<s> Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
<s> I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
<s> Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
<s> Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
<s> Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
<s> NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
<s> In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
<s> I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
<s> Liquid metal.
<s> That is one of my mission parameters.
<s> Why?
<s> What?
<s> A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
<s> No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
<s> Remember what I said, you can't...
<s> I'm sorry, John.
<s> Where'd you learn all this stuff?
<s> No!  Don't kill him!
<s> Alright, it!  We need it!
<s> Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
<s> Ready.
<s> SHOOT!!!!
<s> There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
<s> Open the goddamn door!
<s> So do you.
<s> Can you get us in there, past security?
<s> Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
<s> Eating is eating... and...
<s> But I promised your mother.
<s> I'm Steve. What's your name?
<s> You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
<s> Some.
<s> They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
<s> Yes.
<s> Five minutes.
<s> Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
<s> A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
<s> What museum?
<s> Yes.
<s> I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
<s> May I ask a question?
<s> Yes, von der Null.
<s> You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
<s> And what happened to Von der Nul?
<s> You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
<s> Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
<s> It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
<s> Me? Never.  Never.
<s> Do you know what's in this archive?
<s> Show you?
<s> Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
<s> So. You wanted to see me.
<s> I don't know what you mean, Major.
<s> Sure.
<s> First oboe.
<s> It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
<s> All.
<s> What's it to ya?
<s> Yes.  Don't hurt me.
<s> Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
<s> Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
<s> One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
<s> Right.
<s> Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
<s> It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
<s> You like it?  It's my first.
<s> Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
<s> You must have had a fun child-
<s> I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
<s> I want it to be over for you.
<s> I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
<s> If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
<s> Good fighters.
<s> Ticklish?
<s> You'll beg for mercy in a second.
<s> We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
<s> Cover...our footsteps...
<s> With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
<s> Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
<s> Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
<s> You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
<s> Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
<s> You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
<s> I said I was sorry...
<s> Oh, no... you.
<s> Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
<s> He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
<s> It was a gift... from my brother.
<s> What's C.R.S.?
<s> Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
<s> Seriously?  What did they say?
<s> Come here...
<s> I thought...
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Get out.
<s> Get out of my car!
<s> No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
<s> It might be best if we didn't talk.
<s> Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
<s> You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
<s> Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
<s> Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
<s> That's not true...
<s> Claire.
<s> Boyfriend?
<s> Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
<s> No.
<s> You shouldn't have.
<s> Okay.
<s> Are you still on mediction?
<s> They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
<s> Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
<s> We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
<s> You're part of it...
<s> Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
<s> Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
<s> There's nothing to forgive.
<s> I hope.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Humor me with specifics.
<s> Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
<s> Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
<s> I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
<s> Like, this way... sort of...
<s> I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
<s> Have we met?
<s> Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
<s> Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
<s> Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<s> Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
<s> Don't ask.
<s> That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
<s> You know you can.
<s> Sam...  Thank you.
<s> You warm my heart.
<s> What?
<s> Who's Watts?
<s> I did okay.
<s> Why?
<s> Do we still get paid for the week?
<s> It's a question.
<s> Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
<s> He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
<s> No.
<s> You want company?
<s> Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
<s> In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
<s> I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
<s> I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
<s> And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
<s> Test it.
<s> How'd I know it was for you?
<s> Good.
<s> Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
<s> I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
<s> No one will come any nearer than that.
<s> I don't know what you mean.
<s> That's why we're here.
<s> Yes.  I've missed it.
<s> You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
<s> What's his first name?
<s> Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
<s> Maybe you did it yourself.
<s> There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
<s> Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
<s> I have a loft.
<s> Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
<s> Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
<s> I don't think I want any.
<s> Then what good is he?
<s> Like you.
<s> We think?
<s> This is un-fucking professional.
<s> Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
<s> Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
<s> England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
<s> What'd you call that -- the Protector?
<s> Round about, yeah.
<s> That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
<s> What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
<s> Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
<s> Not me, man.
<s> It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
<s> Again?
<s> Well, those are the breaks.
<s> You look alike.
<s> Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
<s> I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
<s> I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
<s> Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
<s> Nah, accommodation address.
<s> Various enterprises, style of thing.
<s> Why not.
<s> I'll bloody well ask him.
<s> You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
<s> You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
<s> A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
<s> We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
<s> Get seven years, did you?
<s> Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
<s> You sound like my fucking probation officer.
<s> Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
<s> Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
<s> She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
<s> Up the coast.
<s> I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
<s> Eh?
<s> All of what?
<s> As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
<s> And that is?
<s> He had urgent business in the north.
<s> Good luck.
<s> And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
<s> Any happier than any other asshole in life.
<s> Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
<s> While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
<s> Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
<s> What do you think?
<s> Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
<s> They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
<s> That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
<s> About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
<s> The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
<s> Who?
<s> Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
<s> Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
<s> Boy.
<s> Oh, Mr Crane--
<s> But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
<s> Did she make mistakes?
<s> Uh--
<s> That right.
<s> Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
<s> Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
<s> I can get it, yeah.
<s> And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
<s> OK. Take your coat, Ann?
<s> Mm.
<s> Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
<s> $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
<s> Mm.
<s> I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
<s> Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
<s> No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
<s> *I* was with her.
<s> Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
<s> And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
<s> So... who... who actually--
<s> ...who among us is in a position to say...
<s> Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
<s> Sure, Walter. Thanks.
<s> Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
<s> Huh?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yeah, yeah--go home.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Huh? No.
<s> He's the dead guy.
<s> Hello.
<s> Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
<s> Ah.
<s> Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
<s> Uh... you're under arrest.
<s> Why not?
<s> What's the combination?
<s> That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
<s> It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
<s> Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
<s> Call me Vince.
<s> Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
<s> So the method of death is the only connection?
<s> If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
<s> This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
<s> May I see that?
<s> What is it?
<s> I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
<s> Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
<s> Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
<s> You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
<s> Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
<s> So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
<s> Look who's here, Margo.
<s> Yes.
<s> He's right.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> What is it?
<s> Big as a house.
<s> Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
<s> Eats them?
<s> Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
<s> With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
<s> What happened?
<s> I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
<s> All right.  If you're positive.
<s> I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
<s> No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
<s> The planetarium!
<s> I think... it means it's full.
<s> I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
<s> Oh God!  Help!
<s> Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
<s> I can't!
<s> One.
<s> It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
<s> What's to see?
<s> He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
<s> What have we missed?
<s> Thank you.
<s> --a dead one at that.
<s> That and a fat, new contract.
<s> Amnesia.
<s> It has to be the reality.
<s> But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
<s> Let me demonstrate some examples.
<s> All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
<s> We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
<s> I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
<s> A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<s> They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
<s> It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
<s> I think I've studied enough.
<s> I...I can't.
<s> You think so?
<s> <i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
<s> Your Dad?!
<s> Yeah...
<s> Gee, that's great.
<s> A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
<s> I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
<s> How do you know?
<s> I made macaroni.
<s> I still want to look over a couple of things.
<s> Good night, Mother.
<s> Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
<s> --What the hell are you talking about?!
<s> You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
<s> I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
<s> I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
<s> The whole area's being evacuated.
<s> Yeah.
<s> When was that?
<s> I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
<s> Yes. I know.
<s> Yes.
<s> Brought on by what?
<s> Incinerate it. Like the others.
<s> You got some kind of business with him?
<s> Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
<s> We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
<s> Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
<s> No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
<s> What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
<s> Yeah, well I don't have them all.
<s> Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
<s> Did you find something?
<s> Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
<s> Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
<s> They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
<s> I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
<s> There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
<s> I was until about an hour ago.
<s> There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
<s> About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
<s> I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
<s> What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
<s> Mulder --
<s> Very weird.
<s> Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
<s> General McAddie's.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
<s> I have answers for you.
<s> About the conspiracy?
<s> A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
<s> I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
<s> I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
<s> The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
<s> A pocketful of rye...
<s> She thinks I can bring Edward back.
<s> I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
<s> A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
<s> I don't need them anymore...
<s> You don't know the procedure.
<s> Peter, okay?
<s> You're the shrink, you tell me.
<s> I did, yeah.
<s> If you believe that.
<s> What difference does it make...?
<s> I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
<s> They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
<s> Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
<s> Sometime yesterday morning.
<s> Yes.
<s> Prevacid.  For my stomach.
<s> Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
<s> Completely unaware.
<s> Now?
<s> It's his dog.
<s> She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
<s> No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
<s> He has a little dog.
<s> Dr. Winkel told me that.
<s> I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
<s> The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
<s> Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
<s> Need we go through it all again?
<s> Just another part I've got to learn.
<s> Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
<s> Yes.
<s> Me.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why are you lying?
<s> From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
<s> Of course.
<s> What did you say? I'm sorry...
<s> Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
<s> It wasn't petrol.
<s> As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
<s> I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
<s> Bring him in.
<s> It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
<s> Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
<s> We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
<s> This way, miss.
<s> Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
<s> No, I don't know...
<s> I'll look it up for you.
<s> Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
<s> Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
<s> It's good to see you, Holly.
<s> She's been arrested.
<s> I told the police.
<s> You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
<s> You can get somebody else...
<s> As long as they can use you?
<s> Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
<s> Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Here?
<s> What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
<s> But you will.
<s> Yes.
<s> What's he saying?
<s> Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
<s> Yes.
<s> Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
<s> He didn't want to get involved.
<s> That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
<s> Joseph Harbin.
<s> With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm sorry, I don't think so.
<s> Just take it, OK.
<s> Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
<s> Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
<s> Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
<s> Two.
<s> Richard, you know something -
<s> Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
<s> If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
<s> They don't have extermination camps.
<s> They sound like you.
<s> He's an asshole.
<s> That's a movie, you moron.
<s> Who the fuck are you?
<s> You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
<s> Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
<s> At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
<s> "And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
<s> He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
<s> Yes, I am. Basically I am.
<s> I stole it. From a synagogue.
<s> Oh, yeah... 
<s> What's it mean?
<s> Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
<s> That's stupid.
<s> V'asitem...
<s> About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
<s> Do they?
<s> Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
<s> Lina, come here!
<s> Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
<s> I doubt it. How did you find out?
<s> Who's Eichmann?!!?
<s> It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
<s> They're liars and cowards.
<s> I agree.
<s> Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
<s> I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
<s> To hear them read Torah.
<s> The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
<s> There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
<s> From the Rhineland originally.
<s> Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
<s> I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
<s> I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
<s> Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
<s> Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
<s> Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
<s> Who told you that?
<s> Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
<s> I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
<s> Who even knew?
<s> Just do it.
<s> I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
<s> Why me?
<s> The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
<s> ...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
<s> Do I give a shit?
<s> Fund-raising??
<s> Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
<s> They're not that Jewish.
<s> I was just trying to make a point. If --
<s> Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
<s> ... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
<s> Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
<s> I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
<s> ... So am I.
<s> The documents are forged.
<s> Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
<s> Italy!
<s> Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
<s> Enzo!
<s> Enzo, why do you guys do this?
<s> Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
<s> No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
<s> The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
<s> Lira?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
<s> You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
<s> Noireuter.
<s> Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> What?
<s> I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
<s> Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
<s> The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
<s> Yes.
<s> ... Yes.
<s> No... in the hut.
<s> ... Okay.  I'll try.
<s> Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
<s> How do you know that?
<s> Uh... Yes, of course!
<s> ... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
<s> Uh... Ah!  A story?
<s> No... tell me.
<s> You'll understand.
<s> ... Nothing.
<s> No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
<s> It's my apartment.
<s> Way past it.
<s> How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
<s> His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
<s> Then, goodbye.
<s> I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
<s> What's your first move?
<s> Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
<s> Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
<s> Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
<s> I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
<s> Yeah, no kidding.
<s> Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
<s> Sure. Why not.
<s> Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
<s> ...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
<s> The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
<s> While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
<s> Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
<s> No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
<s> What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
<s> It's Friday.
<s> I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
<s> Good looking?
<s> Nice fellow?
<s> I drink.
<s> Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
<s> Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
<s> What do you want to see him for?
<s> Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
<s> I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
<s> You're worrying about its killing someone else?
<s> Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
<s> It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
<s> Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
<s> Charlie likes his leopard.
<s> It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
<s> I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
<s> A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
<s> But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
<s> I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
<s> No.
<s> It's better you don't know.
<s> Thanks, Sheriff.
<s> Go on foot.
<s> I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
<s> Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
<s> Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
<s> The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
<s> Now look what you've done.
<s> Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
<s> Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
<s> Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
<s> That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
<s> Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
<s> It's all right. I'm not hurt.
<s> Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
<s> That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
<s> What... What are you talking about?
<s> Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
<s> Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
<s> Sorry?
<s> It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
<s> I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
<s> He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
<s> Get to the point, will you...
<s> A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
<s> I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
<s> I’m fine standing, thank you.
<s> I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
<s> I know where to look.
<s> I’m sure I’ll find a way.
<s> So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
<s> If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> No... No...  I swear...
<s> What?
<s> I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
<s> F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
<s> I certainly did, sir...
<s> Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
<s> It’s not.
<s> Your secretary, huh!
<s> Yes. How did...
<s> Okay. Recommended...
<s> Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
<s> My rates...
<s> Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
<s> Have you?
<s> Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
<s> Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
<s> Can I get up now?
<s> Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
<s> The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
<s> Los Angeles?
<s> Cinq cents.
<s> Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
<s> What do you think, huh?
<s> Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
<s> Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
<s> Cost what?
<s> What’s that? A word?
<s> Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
<s> No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
<s> Tremoille... don't.  Please...
<s> Do you think I could have some water?
<s> Right.  Raymond... a priest.
<s> Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
<s> How dare you stop me doing God's will!
<s> How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
<s> But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
<s> Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
<s> I promise...
<s> But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
<s> Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
<s> If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
<s> But... why... what's the point?
<s> I want to stay with you...
<s> I'm staying, Jean.
<s> I tried to.
<s> I don't know...
<s> We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
<s> Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
<s> Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
<s> So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
<s> I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
<s> I will hear you... but not now, not here.
<s> Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
<s> Nineteen... or thereabouts...
<s> Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
<s> I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
<s> And may I go to Mass?
<s> It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
<s> He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
<s> Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
<s> Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
<s> I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
<s> My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
<s> There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
<s> If there was, I didn't see it...
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes... they were.
<s> He's on the other side of the river.
<s> You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
<s> We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
<s> Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
<s> Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
<s> I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
<s> Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
<s> Yes, it's a miracle.
<s> Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
<s> Perfectly.
<s> I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
<s> So... bring up the reinforcements!
<s> Of course I do?  Bring them up!
<s> It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
<s> Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
<s> Don't swear...
<s> What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
<s> Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
<s> I said, kneel!
<s> Playing...
<s> I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
<s> And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
<s> No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
<s> Yes... lots of things!
<s> Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
<s> So your memory's coming back?
<s> I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> I need to confess again.
<s> Whose were they?
<s> Oh, yes. I remember.
<s> I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
<s> My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
<s> Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
<s> I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
<s> That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
<s> Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
<s> Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
<s> What's happened?
<s> Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
<s> I haven't seen him.
<s> Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
<s> Who told you?
<s> Who's recruiting?
<s> But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
<s> Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
<s> What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
<s> Warsaw's not the only radio station.
<s> It certainly was.
<s> That makes a change.
<s> Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
<s> Just shut up.
<s> You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
<s> You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
<s> You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
<s> There are always notices going up.
<s> Can you help? I've no money...
<s> ...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
<s> Cow!
<s> You made contact?
<s> Out of Warsaw. Where?
<s> I am... I was a pianist.
<s> I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
<s> Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
<s> Watch your feet!
<s> Watch his hand
<s> There is something to be said for silence
<s> She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
<s> I'll be back.
<s> She's stunted, that's one thing.
<s> No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
<s> I don't want to learn.
<s> You mean in signs?
<s> I just want to listen.
<s> It's my mother's piano.
<s> You've missed this bit.
<s> Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
<s> That's right.
<s> Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
<s> Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
<s> He'll probably fall down.
<s> Naw, it's okay.
<s> You think my play is bad?
<s> If that's the way you want it.
<s> He was a con man, wasn't he?
<s> You sure he didn't just pocket it?
<s> What about the other one?
<s> Hackers.
<s> What do ya want the others to get?
<s> Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
<s> And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
<s> You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
<s> Let him wait.
<s> Well we got some workin' money anyway.
<s> What do ya mean?
<s> No, not a thing.
<s> Yeh.
<s> Naw, I'd just blow it.
<s> I also gotta win.
<s> Pass.
<s> Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
<s> You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
<s> I'll square it with the fixer.
<s> Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
<s> Where you goin'?
<s> No.
<s> You move right along, don't ya.
<s> Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
<s> 660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
<s> Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
<s> He's right, Les.
<s> Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
<s> If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
<s> On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
<s> There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
<s> Never heard of the place.
<s> Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
<s> Why don't you pick him up yourself?
<s> What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
<s> Come on, gimme a break.
<s> He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
<s> Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
<s> That is, if it's all right with you.
<s> Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
<s> Give it to me.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
<s> Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
<s> Yes.
<s> Where did you hit her?
<s> Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
<s> He's been dead for three months.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> It's a promise?
<s> He's all right.
<s> Only in bad weather.
<s> Not a thing.
<s> I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
<s> What's that to you?
<s> I'm asking you.
<s> No.
<s> You mean about that gun?
<s> Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
<s> Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
<s> Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
<s> No.
<s> Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
<s> Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
<s> Oh, then you did hear from him?
<s> He did!
<s> Did you go?
<s> Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
<s> Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
<s> He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
<s> What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
<s> Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
<s> Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
<s> Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
<s> Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
<s> Hello, Mimi.
<s> Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
<s> I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
<s> Oh, this is Andy --
<s> We need ice.
<s> She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
<s> Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
<s> Yes.
<s> They were kidding you.
<s> You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
<s> Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Your guess is as good as mine.
<s> Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
<s> You talk as if I were Asta.
<s> It was his body that was buried there.
<s> That's a fact.
<s> I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
<s> Got a nice evening dress?
<s> Got a nice evening dress?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
<s> No... no.
<s> Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
<s> Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
<s> No, please, not again.
<s> We're going to keep driving.
<s> Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
<s> You just go when I say go.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
<s> So we wait.
<s> You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
<s> Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
<s> You don't know that.
<s> What about Jaeger?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Knock it off!
<s> Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
<s> No you're not.
<s> I did it!  I got the box open.
<s> Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
<s> Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
<s> Wait.  Wait.
<s> Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
<s> Roger that.
<s> Oh, that's fun.
<s> Wh-what do you think--
<s> Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
<s> Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
<s> Just be cool.
<s> I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
<s> If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
<s> Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
<s> What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
<s> The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
<s> So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
<s> Something like that.
<s> I hope it means something, otherwise...
<s> I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
<s> We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
<s> What?
<s> We'll find our way.
<s> Wes is dead!
<s> We'll lie.
<s> If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
<s> It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
<s> Well, we should identify ourselves.
<s> Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
<s> I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
<s> I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
<s> I just said I would.  I don't think I--
<s> I don't know.  They killed Wes.
<s> With what?  Against how many?
<s> You come up with a better plan, let me know.
<s> Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
<s> When did you make the switch?
<s> Thanks.
<s> What?
<s> He's going to slow down.
<s> The photos.
<s> A headache?
<s> Now you need me.
<s> What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
<s> What!?
<s> The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
<s> You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
<s> Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
<s> Yes!
<s> You know what I'm doing with my half?
<s> Oh, God!
<s> We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
<s> You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
<s> I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
<s> We have to do something.
<s> 4732...?
<s> No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
<s> Vocasity
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> Now.
<s> Look,dirt!
<s> Looks like dirt.
<s> What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
<s> It's 3+27 hundred
<s> No!  Don't go.
<s> No....I though  I'm afraid.
<s> AH UGH.
<s> I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
<s> What?
<s> We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
<s> I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
<s> Where is LUH?
<s> I don't feel well.
<s> Look!
<s> What?
<s> Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
<s> All the insides are gone!
<s> All right...
<s> I thought of something.....
<s> I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
<s> Yes...
<s> I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
<s> Thanks.
<s> One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
<s> What?
<s> Would you?
<s> Me, too.
<s> You got it.
<s> Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
<s> Easy, guys.  
<s> Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
<s> We work fast enough for you?
<s> Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
<s> We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
<s> A bowling alley.
<s> Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
<s> Taylor's dead.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Security.
<s> Stay in the truck.
<s> What? Nobody, I-
<s> Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
<s> What kind of bomb was it?
<s> Shit. We're fucked.
<s> Look who's talking, old man.
<s> What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
<s> I thought I told you--
<s> It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
<s> And diamonds in the front.
<s> Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
<s> erect in sweater, arms folded.
<s> in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
<s> About tonsils.
<s> So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
<s> Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
<s> No.
<s> No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
<s> Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
<s> Nice suit.
<s> Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
<s> Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
<s> No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
<s> M'sieu ...
<s> Good day, Doctor.
<s> The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
<s> Thank you.
<s> And take the twenty thousand francs ...
<s> We'll take the Royal Suite!
<s> What?
<s> Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
<s> Spanish passports?
<s> At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
<s> <u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<s> That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
<s> Lily-- 
<s> Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
<s> I remember.
<s> Oh! You didn't read it!
<s> No. What is it? Tell me.
<s> As you like. 
<s> It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
<s> Ye-es?
<s> What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
<s> What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
<s> Lipstick?
<s> <u>Adolph</u>?
<s> I don't believe it!
<s> Divine ...
<s> Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
<s> Yes, Madame Colet?
<s> Yes--uh--
<s> Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
<s> For all the really important things--
<s> Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
<s> Ever had a romance with a crook?
<s> Well, he was in the navy.
<s> But you saw it here.
<s> Thank you, Rose.
<s> I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
<s> Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
<s> I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
<s> You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
<s> I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
<s> That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
<s> Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
<s> I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
<s> We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
<s> If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
<s> Excuse me.
<s> No.
<s> Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
<s> Could I speak to you in private?
<s> Is he your boyfriend?
<s> Yes, exactly!
<s> Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
<s> Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
<s> No, no! Just with her hands.
<s> You wouldn'ta jumped.
<s> Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
<s> Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
<s> Sure. If you like.
<s> A mistake?
<s> I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
<s> I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
<s> You're right. Only you can do that.
<s> He does landscapes.
<s> Au contraire, mon cher.
<s> Could it have damaged the ship?
<s> I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
<s> Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
<s> I promise.
<s> That's enough.
<s> You think she was really there?
<s> Would you like anything?
<s> Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
<s> You had it the entire time?!
<s> Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
<s> How can you put this on my shoulders?
<s> Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
<s> Do you want the truth, Anya?
<s> Sure!
<s> Baloney!
<s> Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
<s> <U>Gladly</U>.
<s> I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
<s> Guess again, copper.
<s> I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
<s> Want to take it back?
<s> You work too fast for me, young man.
<s> Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
<s> Well, I can't.
<s> Okay.
<s> For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
<s> You mean that?
<s> Lonesome?
<s> I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
<s> I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
<s> Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
<s> A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
<s> I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
<s> Make it five.
<s> I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
<s> Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
<s> <U>Me</U>!
<s> Where did you hide it?
<s> Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
<s> That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
<s> Oh, yes. On the pier.
<s> Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
<s> It's a bet--come on, Sally!
<s> Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
<s> I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
<s> She did?
<s> In New York.
<s> Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
<s> Send that.
<s> Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
<s> Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
<s> So what?
<s> This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
<s> I was never stiffer in my life.
<s> Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
<s> You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
<s> No--not much--excepting-- 
<s> No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
<s> I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
<s> But not nice enough to marry--eh?
<s> Very serious?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
<s> Somebody's got to do it--
<s> Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
<s> No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
<s> They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
<s> The country boy's about due.
<s> This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
<s> Say, "Thanks very much!"
<s> I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
<s> "Smooth's" the word.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
<s> What!--are you crazy?
<s> I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
<s> 500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
<s> Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
<s> Nice voice.
<s> Well I'm not so go home.
<s> This brand.
<s> No...
<s> Excuse me?
<s> But wait, you don't understand-
<s> Yeah, you look it.
<s> All right, lunger.  Have at it.
<s> Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
<s> I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
<s> Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
<s> I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
<s> I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
<s> Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
<s> Ignore her?
<s> I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
<s> But Doc-
<s> How you feelin', Doc?
<s> Then what do I do?
<s> Awful lot of money.
<s> What was that all about?
<s> Good God, you're really-
<s> Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
<s> What about her?
<s> Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
<s> Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
<s> I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
<s> Wyatt...
<s> Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
<s> Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
<s> Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
<s> Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
<s> That what you got me up here for?
<s> They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
<s> We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
<s> Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
<s> Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
<s> Morg, use your head.
<s> Yeah.  It's a fact.
<s> 500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
<s> Doc's just in no kinda shape.
<s> Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
<s> They're carrying guns in town.
<s> Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
<s> Yeah, and dangerous.
<s> GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
<s> 36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
<s> Sightseeing.
<s> Four o'clock. Don't be late.
<s> - We all want what we can't have?
<s> That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
<s> Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
<s> - Four wheel drive?
<s> ... 17 Beverage cup holders?
<s> Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
<s> Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
<s> Is this another one of your games?
<s> Political considerations?
<s> Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
<s> Well... If you insist.
<s> Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
<s> I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
<s> Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
<s> I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
<s> Interesting video tape.
<s> Depends what number you write.
<s> Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
<s> The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
<s> You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
<s> Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
<s> The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
<s> No. I'm going with you.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Cleans dirt. Let's go.
<s> Don't say it.
<s> You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
<s> If not?
<s> First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
<s> Now.
<s> 'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
<s> Of course.
<s> I understand.
<s> I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
<s> Sabotage?
<s> Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
<s> Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
<s> Captain Morton.
<s> Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
<s> Pencil it in for the next trip -
<s> Seems to be back to normal, sir.
<s> Get more men up there!
<s> I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
<s> Yes. Shall we kill them?
<s> No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
<s> Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
<s> You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
<s> What is it, noontime?
<s> Will you still get the money from your father?
<s> He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
<s> Like a veil has been lifted?
<s> You were in hell?
<s> Babe Brother.
<s> I've heard some foolish things in my life.
<s> Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
<s> I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
<s> Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
<s> It is just a regular card.
<s> Now how far would further out be?
<s> Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
<s> Just stay in bed and rest.
<s> You stay inside. I will see to them.
<s> You must have been really sick.
<s> I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
<s> I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
<s> I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
<s> You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
<s> It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
<s> Well, I don't want to put you out.
<s> All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
<s> You must have done something to her.
<s> What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
<s> That's nice.
<s> Girl, do you still sing and dance?
<s> Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
<s> Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
<s> You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
<s> I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
<s> Counting the gray hairs in your head.
<s> Well, sure, we can leave it up.
<s> Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
<s> Okay...
<s> Bye, house.
<s> What?  What is it?
<s> Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
<s> See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
<s> Let's let Molly open one.
<s> Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
<s> I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
<s> Watch yourself!!
<s> Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
<s> You're mocking me, aren't you?
<s> Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
<s> That's why.  Sid.
<s> You mean that happy child?
<s> Trouble?!  Where?!
<s> I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
<s> But we're not on my planet, are we?
<s> YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
<s> Shield your eyes!
<s> Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
<s> Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
<s> I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
<s> No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> We've got to get out of here...NOW.
<s> Hold still, Buzz!
<s> Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
<s> What's with him?
<s> Murderer!
<s> Did I get my package in the mail?
<s> Oh no, Hannah!
<s> I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
<s> She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
<s> Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
<s> That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
<s> Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
<s> Uh-oh.
<s> What?!
<s> I knew you'd come back, Woody!
<s> See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
<s> But you're Irish!
<s> Do what?  Oh, I see.
<s> You're not so old yourself!
<s> Finn -
<s> What difference does <i>that</i> make?
<s> So did I.
<s> Nothing is left but us.
<s> We're too young.
<s> Victoria -
<s> Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
<s> I can't find Manolo.
<s> He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
<s> What is he being charged with?
<s> I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
<s> What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
<s> I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
<s> I was just waiting for the right time.
<s> I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
<s> That's frustrating.
<s> I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
<s> Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
<s> Barbara --
<s> Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
<s> How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
<s> Will we get invited to the White House?
<s> How long's the job?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Just watch.
<s> What is this, like freebase?
<s> Have you done your homework, honey?
<s> Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
<s> Depends who it's from.
<s> You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
<s> That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
<s> They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
<s> The police won't find your car.
<s> Not this time.
<s> It was an anonymous tip.
<s> What do you look for?
<s> This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
<s> I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
<s> I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
<s> Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
<s> If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
<s> Shag her senseless.
<s> Thanks.
<s> think I left something back at the -
<s> Because it's illegal.
<s> Are you clean?
<s> It's an interesting theory.
<s> What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
<s> No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
<s> No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
<s> Right.
<s> And you might get the fucking job.
<s> Roald Dahl.
<s> Give me the gun.
<s> Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
<s> What?
<s> No, he didn't make me touch it.
<s> When are you going to visit him?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Four Grand.
<s> Your usual table, sir?
<s> The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
<s> Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
<s> That's fair enough.
<s> I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
<s> He doubts me.
<s> Plotting our new course.
<s> I don't have a clue.
<s> Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
<s> Oh, please.
<s> It's all I have.
<s> What do you know of my pain?
<s> Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
<s> I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
<s> Why didn't you beep my communicator?
<s> Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
<s> Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
<s> Are we leaving, Captain?
<s> I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
<s> Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
<s> Go to sleep, Spock.
<s> The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
<s> Yes, Captain.
<s> An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
<s> Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
<s> He did have pointed ears.
<s> It must be all those marsh melons.
<s> The emergency channel, open.
<s> Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
<s> Welcome aboard, Captain.
<s> James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
<s> The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
<s> Now learn something about yourself.
<s> No conditions.
<s> 
<s> 
<s> Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
<s> Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
<s> Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
<s> No. You must kill me.
<s> I belong here.
<s> I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
<s> Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
<s> You haven't told him?
<s> Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
<s> You call that getting over it?
<s> Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
<s> oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
<s> Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
<s> No...
<s> No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
<s> I'm sorry -
<s> What do you want with the Pentagon?
<s> If you think -
<s> The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
<s> I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
<s> Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
<s> No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
<s> Yeah, I... oops!
<s> I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
<s> All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
<s> Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
<s> Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
<s> Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
<s> Probably.
<s> Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
<s> Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
<s> Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
<s> We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
<s> I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
<s> He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
<s> Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
<s> You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
<s> They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
<s> We have to.
<s> Why is everything...like this?
<s> Then I owe you some thanks...
<s> Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
<s> Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
<s> It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
<s> Where are you off to young lady?
<s> Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
<s> Okay.  Here she comes.
<s> That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
<s> You want me to just hang-- ?
<s> I'll just hang then, shall I?
<s> Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
<s> Yeah, but for who?							*
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> ... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
<s> If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
<s> I wasn't cheating!
<s> Ten, Mr. Gibson.
<s> I agree.
<s> That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
<s> And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
<s> Yes what?
<s> Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
<s> Oral hygiene?
<s> Yeah, it was wild.
<s> Yeah.  It was great.
<s> My husband the hero.
<s> Well, maybe a little.
<s> Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
<s> Yeah.  I suppose he is.
<s> Answer the question--
<s> No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
<s> The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
<s> What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
<s> I'm not wearing any.
<s> You wouldn't believe me.
<s> I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
<s> Did you pork her Harry?
<s> I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
<s> So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
<s> What about the husbands?
<s> Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
<s> Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
<s> No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
<s> What is it you need me to do?
<s> Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
<s> Nope.
<s> You can't have just one.
<s> And here we are.
<s> The oriental.
<s> Want some Goobers?
<s> Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
<s> My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
<s> There's nothing to tell.
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> What's your favorite color?
<s> Very much. Now, where were we?
<s> Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
<s> I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
<s> And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
<s> I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
<s> I just gotta get somethin'.
<s> Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
<s> What?
<s> Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
<s> Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
<s> Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
<s> Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Get the fuck outta here!
<s> Ask him if he got the letter.
<s> Now tell him goodbye.
<s> I certainly hope so.
<s> I know.
<s> Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
<s> Where?
<s> The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
<s> Two guys.
<s> No shit? Dick, that's great!
<s> No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
<s> This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
<s> No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
<s> Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
<s> I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
<s> Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
<s> You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
<s> Do you still have friends on the force?
<s> Nope.
<s> No.
<s> Step inside.
<s> I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
<s> Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
<s> Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
<s> We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
<s> How's he supposed to see the wire?
<s> I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
<s> - Because it's good!
<s> Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
<s> If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
<s> No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
<s> Do you know where we can find him?
<s> Where's that?
<s> I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
<s> Meaning...???
<s> So that...???
<s> Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
<s> They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
<s> I have to go.
<s> 1995?
<s> Perhaps it was a wrong number...
<s> You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
<s> "If something really happens"...like what, James?
<s> And I was in it?  What did I do?
<s> You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
<s> I thought you didn't know how to drive.
<s> Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
<s> I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
<s> First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
<s> You're sure?
<s> They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
<s> If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
<s> Well, you look pretty different, too.
<s> On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
<s> Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
<s> No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
<s> I need to make a telephone call.
<s> What's that mean?
<s> Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
<s> You do know me.  You helped me once.
<s> Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
<s> Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
<s> I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
<s> Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
<s> She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
<s> You want to go in?  Examine him?
<s> Might be tight.
<s> On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
<s> You can't do that yourself?
<s> All right, old man.  Christ.
<s> Christ!
<s> I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
<s> Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
<s> More or less.
<s> Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
<s> One way.
<s> I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
<s> 'Cause Harlin used to own it.
<s> So?
<s> Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
<s> I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
<s> If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
<s> Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
<s> Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
<s> That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
<s> You believe that?
<s> That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
<s> What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
<s> Yeah, I'll try.
<s> I think I burned my gun hand!
<s> What do you want?
<s> Wrong number.
<s> You didn't hear something?
<s> There's someone in the house.
<s> The wind isn't blowing.
<s> My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
<s> I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
<s> I pack up and go somewhere else.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I guess it must.
<s> I have ideas.
<s> Still playing?
<s> I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
<s> You just walk away.
<s> From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
<s> Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
<s> How much money has he got?
<s> Because I know you're full of shit.
<s> I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
<s> After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
<s> I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
<s> We're going all the way.  Together.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Give him the money.
<s> You killed him!
<s> Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
<s> I'm here.
<s> What for?
<s> Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
<s> Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
<s> I'm her husband.
<s> Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
<s> Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
<s> Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
<s> My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
<s> I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
<s> That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
<s> I did?
<s> I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
<s> You're talking like a mad man.
<s> A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
<s> I need thirteen.
<s> I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
<s> No.
<s> Trouble with the car again?
<s> You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
<s> There's another reason?  It better be good.
<s> That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
<s> Christ, Jake, please--
<s> What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
<s> Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
<s> You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
<s> Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
<s> You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
<s> What?
<s> Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
<s> Oz.
<s> How old are you?
<s> 'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
<s> Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
<s> I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
<s> No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
<s> No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
<s> Not as bad as it looks.
<s> Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
<s> Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
<s> And you're taking?
<s> Eh?
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't--
<s> I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
<s> That's 'cause he's dead.
<s> I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
<s> Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
<s> Stand up.
<s> Give it to me!
<s> Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
<s> I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
<s> Grace, tell him.
<s> You broke my nose!
<s> Accident.
<s> You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
<s> Like you don't know.
<s> I was hoping we could talk.
<s> About what you said this morning.
<s> You came to take my wife from me?
<s> Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
<s> I've had time to get over it.
<s> Oz.
<s> You're too quick for me.
<s> I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
<s> Will you shut up!
<s> Yep.
<s> Time.
<s> Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
<s> About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
<s> It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
<s> I don't have a goddamn credit card.
<s> What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
<s> You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
<s> What sign?
<s> What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
<s> When I work on a car, I work on a car.
<s> No.
<s> My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
<s> It's Grace.
<s> You're welcome, Grace.
<s> Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
<s> Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
<s> All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
<s> I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
<s> I pack up and go somewhere else.
<s> Thank you.
<s> A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
<s> Come here.
<s> No.
<s> Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
<s> Try me.
<s> Is it pretty?
<s> Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
<s> If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
<s> Stop it.
<s> I thought you couldn't get your car.
<s> Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
<s> You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
<s> Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
<s> I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
<s> ...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
<s> How much?
<s> What kind?
<s> No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
<s> Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
<s> You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
<s> I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
<s> No! No! Please!
<s> You didn't hear something?
<s> What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
<s> I want my lawyer!
<s> Oh.
<s> My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
<s> What did I say?
<s> I'll keep it in my office room.
<s> I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
<s> Do you remember me getting sick?
<s> Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
<s> My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
<s> You use your sleeve.
<s> Yes.
<s> Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
<s> Seventy-five percent.
<s> The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
<s> You thought he was carrying a knife?
<s> You're skill.
<s> We are.
<s> I won't make any noise.
<s> I lied.
<s> Elijah was wrong.
<s> It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Is David Dunne there?
<s> Fine.
<s> No.
<s> On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
<s> We was... lyin'.
<s> Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
<s> Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
<s> They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
<s> Advances?
<s> Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
<s> I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
<s> I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
<s> Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Alive?
<s> Those cowboys messin' him up?
<s> No?
<s> ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
<s> Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
<s> Uh... yeah. Yeah.
<s> Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
<s> D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
<s> Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
<s> You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
<s> Is... is it... loaded?
<s> Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
<s> Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
<s> Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
<s> N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
<s> They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
<s> In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
<s> Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
<s> Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
<s> I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
<s> On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
<s> Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
<s> Huh?
<s> Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
<s> After a ways.
<s> You still think he's in there?
<s> Tell me right off if you see him.
<s> You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
<s> I can't see 'em.
<s> First one what?
<s> H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
<s> I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
<s> We done stuff before for money, Ned.
<s> Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
<s> We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
<s> Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
<s> It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
<s> You ain't like that no more.
<s> Beats the hell out of me.
<s> I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
<s> He's dead, Bill.
<s> Two.
<s> Best we move that pig.
<s> The Kid, yeah...
<s> What?
<s> Nothin's bent.
<s> Yeah?
<s> How many you killed, Kid?
<s> He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
<s> Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
<s> You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
<s> An' if I spot 'em?
<s> There's more.
<s> He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
<s> &lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
<s> + The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
<s> Just forget about it.
<s> Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
<s> So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
<s> Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
<s> Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
<s> I can run. I got no problem with that.
<s> They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
<s> Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
<s> McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
<s> McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
<s> Maybe more.
<s> Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
<s> Who's your boss?
<s> Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
<s> You're lying.
<s> Who is he?
<s> What?
<s> This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
<s> I told the D.A. everything I know.
<s> You know a religious guy named John Paul?
<s> He didn't have my lawyer.

<s> Well, we...

<s> Huh!

<s> Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.

<s> Hold on a second.

<s> What?
<s> And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
<s> I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.

I saw them walk on water...'
<s> You got a good memory, Franky.
<s> Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
<s> You use their witness.
<s> Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
<s> You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
<s> I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
<s> My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
<s> ... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
<s> I'm going to see you get that chance.
<s> Mrs...
<s> Yes...
<s> Yes.
<s> These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
<s> She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
<s> Yes.
<s> Thanks, Franky.
<s> Yes.
<s> We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
<s> Me, too.
<s> It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
<s> I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
<s> No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
<s> Then?
<s> I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
<s> More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
<s> It's not my line.
<s> But you knew about this.
<s> Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
<s> Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
<s> Let me come in.
<s> I want to know who you are.
<s> Don't go.
<s> No, Judy, you don't understand.
<s> No.
<s> I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
<s> No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
<s> No, it's not right.
<s> No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
<s> Too late. I've got my face on.
<s> Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
<s> I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
<s> Take me away...
<s> And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
<s> Your accident...
<s> Some money.
<s> At...
<s> You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
<s> I... didn't know where you lived.
<s> My name is John Ferguson.
<s> No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
<s> We have.
<s> Shopping?
<s> Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
<s> If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
<s> I don't like them.
<s> No birds live here.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Madeleine!
<s> The tall trees...
<s> Long ago...
<s> Vaguely...
<s> No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
<s> It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
<s> You can't.
<s> To the church, I must go there.
<s> Please let me go.
<s> It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
<s> What is her name?
<s> How long has she had the room?
<s> I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
<s> I thought you said no more aches and pains?
<s> What's tomorrow?
<s> It wasn't your fault.
<s> Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
<s> It's where you belong.
<s> I've never run across one like that.
<s> That's following a train of thought.
<s> Three whole weeks.
<s> What.
<s> Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
<s> Nothing to tell.
<s> I'll take you home.
<s> Think?  Well, what do you think?
<s> Did you need it?
<s> Oh?
<s> What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
<s> But you said grey, sir.
<s> Can we have it by tonight?
<s> Excellent.
<s> Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
<s> That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
<s> Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
<s> I don't have to...
<s> She's dead.
<s> The hell you do.
<s> You fucking bastard!
<s> You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
<s> So I didn't fucking do it!
<s> What about the blood?
<s> We've already done this.
<s> According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
<s> I can't do this.
<s> I don't give a damn.
<s> What?
<s> There is no candy!
<s> I know you'll be.  Three hours.
<s> Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
<s> Well, oh...
<s> Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
<s> Where is she?
<s> Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
<s> Fish?
<s> Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
<s> Here's his head.
<s> That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
<s> Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
<s> No.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
<s> Say it again.
<s> What you just said. Say it again.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Isn't it a little late?
<s> They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
<s> What's your point?
<s> The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
<s> What?
<s> Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
<s> Goosed!
<s> Goosed!
<s> Sent it.
<s> I think so.
<s> I'm not playing around. I forgot.
<s> You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
<s> Well it's bad timing.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Who else?
<s> What does Moore have to do with your growing?
<s> He's quiet.
<s> You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
<s> We're leaving in three hours.
<s> I'll call them from the road.
<s> We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
<s> Hi.
<s> Well I do.
<s> No. Just like an hour or so.
<s> Okay.
<s> What!
<s> I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
<s> No Micheal did. It was an accident.
<s> Micheal, by accident.
<s> It's too late.
<s> But...
<s> You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
<s> If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
<s> Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
<s> I love you dad.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
<s> Buzzing?
<s> I don't hear it.
<s> Have another drink.
<s> The wahoo moment?
<s> I think so.
<s> I got to agree with that.
<s> Downstairs in the closet.
<s> Oh I know that. How does it go...
<s> I KILLED MY BROTHER!
<s> You'd like me to kill them?
<s> Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
<s> What about them?
<s> That one.
<s> You'll think you're still at the convent.
<s> In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
<s> I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
<s> Evil.
<s> Thank you, Uncle.
<s> Whatever you like.
<s> You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
<s> No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
<s> Go away! Leave me alone.
<s> You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
<s> It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
<s> I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
<s> Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
<s> Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
<s> It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> You're happy, aren't you!
<s> That your cousin is more to your taste.
<s> I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
<s> Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
<s> How much do you want for him?
<s> Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
<s> He couldn't get through the door, then?
<s> They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
<s> Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
<s> That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
<s> You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
<s> Today, a good girl.
<s> No, I don't want to.
<s> Can you tell us what's on the disc?
<s> You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on—line, yet?
<s> If you can catch him.
<s> Where's my gun?
<s> Then I guess we're even.
<s> On my life, I promise you I will.
<s> You think he's smart?
<s> You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
<s> Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
<s> No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
<s> Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
<s> Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
<s> I'm still making adjustments...
<s> I'M WHAT?!
<s> I understand... I understand perfectly.
<s> He hears...everything.
<s> Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
<s> Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
<s> True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
<s> Help me get out of here.
<s> Do me one favor —— if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
<s> I'm still working on it.
<s> I've been in prison, remember?
<s> ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
<s> For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
<s> I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
<s> Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
<s> Both.
<s> Part of him is.
<s> You don't know?
<s> Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
<s> I couldn't tell you.
<s> Duck!
<s> Why's that?
<s> Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
<s> Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
<s> My...secret.
<s> I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
<s> You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
<s> You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
<s> Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
<s> What can it hurt is they offend me.
<s> I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
<s> Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
<s> Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
<s> He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
<s> Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
<s> All I need is the one day.
<s> And you?
<s> One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
<s> It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
<s> We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
<s> ...that's the general idea.
<s> The Ribbon Manufacturers.
<s> ...take a long view.
<s> <u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
<s> Yeah...what was I talking about...?
<s> We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
<s> Gloria -- sell the House.  
<s> Fine. 
<s> Could we have you in here, please...7
<s> Guess who <u>I</u> am.
<s> Quite touching.
<s> It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
<s> BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
<s> Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
<s> Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
<s> Who're you working for?
<s> Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
<s> I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
<s> I have a question for you.
<s> Why do people go to war?
<s> Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
<s> And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
<s> I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
<s> Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
<s> Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.

<s> They got him standing by.
<s> Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
<s> ...that's right.
<s> All the greater accomplishment.
<s> Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
<s> Big mistake.
<s> Might, if I was asked... 
<s> Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
<s> Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
<s> Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
<s> It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
<s> He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
<s> A proud tradition.
<s> Watch me.
<s> <u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
<s> Why are they ...
<s> It's a <u>beret</u>...
<s> British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
<s> ...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
<s> And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
<s> Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
<s> Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
<s> ...of kittens...
<s> ...for the beans, yes...
<s> ...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
<s> Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
<s> Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
<s> Please, no thanks... 
<s> Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
<s> ...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
<s> Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
<s> Anacott Steel. Buy it.
<s> Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
<s> Then get out and close it behind you.
<s> Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
<s> ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
<s> Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
<s> ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
<s> Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
<s> Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
<s> Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
<s> Nah, she asked the wrong question.
<s> Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
<s> I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
<s> Jackson, Steinem...
<s> It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
<s> Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
<s> ...I can't even see it...
<s> Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
<s> What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
<s> ...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
<s> A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
<s> Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
<s> Why do you need to wreck this company?
<s> If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
<s> How much is enough Gordon?
<s> Obviously...
<s> Gordon.
<s> Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
<s> Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
<s> Break it.
<s> So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
<s> Why?
<s> Any better and I'd be guilty.
<s> Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
<s> There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
<s> No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
<s> Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
<s> It's over you, Gordon.
<s> Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
<s> Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
<s> Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
<s> Businessman!
<s> Yeah, yeah, OK
<s> But he still has something Mark hasn't.
<s> Suffer?  We're living in America.
<s> China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
<s> Thank you
<s> No?
<s> A party at a waxwork huh?
<s> You don't happen to have the address do ya?
<s> I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
<s> What?  Tony and China, together?
<s> Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
<s> I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
<s> China
<s> Go away.
<s> Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
<s> So Mark, what's so urgent?
<s> Well divide 18 into three
<s> You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
<s> Maybe before the event, never after.
<s> Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
<s> I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
<s> That's not true.
<s> So much.
<s> How do you know it's a she?
<s> Isn't there something called group hysteria?
<s> Do you?
<s> Have you been hurt?
<s> No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
<s> Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
<s> Who?  Your husband?
<s> Wait!  Don't go...
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's fine.
<s> You must have been very proud.
<s> Anyway, Claire slept with him...
<s> ...just so she could cut them off.
<s> I came in from my room...
<s> Good.  I'm good.
<s> Why does everyone find that so surprising?
<s> Yep.
<s> Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
<s> Please.  That's all I need.
<s> No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Jody, wait.
<s> It's alright.
<s> Jody, she's alive.
<s> I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
<s> I know.
<s> We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
<s> Like what?
<s> We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
<s> Don't.
<s> Fine.
<s> I know.
<s> There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
<s> In the house.  I was scared.
<s> Really?
<s> You are so brilliant.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> That's...
<s> No.  Look!  In the window.
<s> ...Don't get all...
<s> Sweetheart--
<s> I will NOT.
<s> When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
<s> But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
<s> But I don't remember.
<s> Stop...
<s> Since when?
<s> Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
<s> So you fucked a student?!
<s> ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
<s> Who?
<s> She's gone.
<s> Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
<s> Huh.
<s> Don't think so.
<s> Nothing.
<s> But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
<s> What are you talk---
<s> You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
<s> Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
<s> In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
<s> Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
<s> Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
<s> Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
<s> I under5tand.  All the same
<s> ENOUGH!!!
<s> You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
<s> You - are - a - murderer.
<s> Now, lasher - it is our time.
<s> He just went out like & light-
<s> Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
<s> Always loved you..
<s> I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
<s> Explain this to me --- violated...?
<s> But have I...?  Ever...?!
<s> Leave me alone!
<s> Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
<s> The one time I want it to work...
<s> You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
<s> Rowan...
<s> It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
<s> And whose houses do you design...?
<s> Really...?  Your family there...?
<s> He fools around with his patients too.
<s> 
<s> Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
<s> He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
<s> Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
<s> They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
<s> Let's see.
<s> It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
<s> No.    This is unreal...
<s> Your beneficence.
<s> A bit much.    Lucas.
<s> What were you talking about...?
<s> It's not true.  You have to believe me.
<s> The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
<s> Just don't fall off any ladders.
<s> Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
<s> Papers...?
<s> I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
<s> I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
<s> Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
<s> CHIC MAGAZINE?
<s> No - not all the time - I mean
<s> No - I've been abroad for a long time...
<s> I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
<s> Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
<s> No she didn't...
<s> I have something I have to show you...
<s> My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
<s> It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
<s> Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
<s> Nothing could be better...
<s> You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
<s> Out - I may be some time
<s> Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
<s> You killed my friend!
<s> No he had to - he's just - he's out...
<s> At home alone - where were you?
<s> And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
<s> Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
<s> You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
<s> Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
<s> Perv.
<s> Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
<s> Not ever. Never.
<s> I better go, Dad.
<s> Dead?
<s> No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
<s> Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
<s> Let me get this straight...
<s> You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
<s> Yeah?
<s> So you'll think about it?
<s> Which you pulled, hard!
<s> You have changed since second grade.
<s> We own a small family grocery store.
<s> It's my private business! Mine!
<s> Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
<s> It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
<s> Well, why should I?
<s> I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
<s> You ordered a Winnebago?
<s> Watch your tone, mister.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> Whatever you want.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> Hang in there, I'll think of something.
<s> I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
<s> We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
<s> Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
<s> I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
<s> Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
<s> You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
<s> Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
<s> I didn't forget.
<s> That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
<s> Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
<s> It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
<s> I'm trying to help.
<s> Then I'll write about YOU.
<s> Interesting.
<s> Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
<s> You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
<s> Your dad taught you everything.
<s> A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
<s> Eventually you'll let go.
<s> I know.
<s> That's refreshingly deviant.
<s> Not a chance.
<s> You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
<s> Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
<s> I'll make you very proud.
<s> Oh. Goodness.
<s> Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
<s> Thanks, Principal Merkin.
<s> Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
<s> A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
<s> Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
<s> As much as possible.
<s> Yeah.  Everything's cool.
<s> I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
<s> I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
<s> --PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
<s> My job. Back off, Benedict.
<s> Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
<s> And the child...
<s> Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
<s> I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
<s> I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
<s> She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
<s> You could tell me where you were last night.
<s> Suzie?
<s> Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
<s> Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
<s> I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
<s> I net a guy in a bar.
<s> What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
<s> I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
<s> Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
<s> We don't know that, Ray...
<s> Ray, you heard him...
<s> The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
<s> He dropped Jimmy off first?
<s> No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
<s> Where's this coming from?
<s> I wanna go home now.
<s> No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
<s> You're out of your mind.
<s> Police -- God -- get a life.
<s> Hi, Mon.
<s> You notice my new jumper?
<s> I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
<s> Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
<s> Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
<s> Stick?
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay.  I love you too.
<s> That's not your line.
<s> Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
<s> So Suzie, you called us, remember?
<s> You got something against cigarettes?
<s> That's right.  That was his name.
<s> In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
<s> But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
<s> That's right.
<s> Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
<s> Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
<s> Are you mad at me?
<s> But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
<s> Funny.  So am I.
<s> No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
<s> Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
<s> You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
<s> I'm going to hit you.
<s> At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
<s> "Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
<s> You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
<s> Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
<s> Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
<s> Relax.  We're almost there.
<s> You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
<s> Oh, thank you.
<s> I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
<s> Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh, I see, an easy plan!
<s> We'll see.
<s> Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
<s> I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
<s> Really?
<s> I don't like to lose, either.
<s> You tell me.
<s> Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
<s> I've had some practice.
<s> You bring the best out in a man.
<s> Private train?
<s> Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
<s> Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
<s> Dr. Loveless?
<s> He had a pressing engagement.
<s> Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
<s> Yes!
<s> Who were they?  What do they want with me?
<s> He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
<s> Right.
<s> Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
<s> Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
<s> No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
<s> Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
<s> Why not?
<s> My step-father's going to tear you apart.
<s> Say what?
<s> He's no magician.
<s> Good.  How long will it take?
<s> Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
<s> My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
<s> You?
<s> She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
<s> That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
<s> Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
<s> What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
<s> No.
<s> Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
<s> As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
<s> No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
<s> There's nobody here.
<s> More!  More!
<s> Who is he?
<s> Queen Cherlindrea?
<s> How are we going to get out there?
<s> Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
<s> That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
<s> Pretty much.
<s> Pick up the hat.
<s> Oh, he's good.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
<s> Who else knows?
<s> Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
<s> Johnny –
<s> Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
<s> Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
<s> I would not be too sure.
<s> You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
<s> Home.
<s> The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
<s> Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
<s> Quaint? Can't imagine why.
<s> I know what he said.
<s> I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
<s> Aren't you? After today?
<s> Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
<s> Where's my baggy pants?
<s> Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
<s> What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
<s> Probably.
<s> At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
<s> His name is John Book.
<s> I have done nothing against the ordnung.
<s> John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
<s> I don't think she knows.
<s> They don't have any shit.
<s> No... No. It is just the English way.
<s> Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
<s> Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
<s> Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
<s> Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
<s> Do you presume to criticize the....
<s> Who are you?
<s> You are?
<s> I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
<s> Goodbye, folks!
<s> Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
<s> Oh!
<s> Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
<s> That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
<s> That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
<s> No, I'm afraid I didn't.
<s> Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
<s> Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
<s> ...Oh, did that hurt?
<s> Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
<s> What sort of an animal is that?
<s> Oh --
<s> You've had plenty of time already!
<s> Look -- it ticks!
<s> No, but you tried to.
<s> Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
<s> The nerve.
<s> In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
<s> I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
<s> It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
<s> Did they hurtcha?
<s> Ohhhh --
<s> Yes -- that's true.
<s> But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
<s> Oh --
<s> What?
<s> I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
<s> Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
<s> Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
<s> It did?
<s> I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
<s> Hold still - hold still --
<s> Whozat?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not nohow!
<s> We do.
<s> Hurry -- hurry --
<s> I can fairly hear my heart beating!
<s> Oh --
<s> Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
<s> Well, I --
<s> Th.D.?
<s> Don’t know any doctor jokes.
<s> So who are you?
<s> I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
<s> It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
<s> Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
<s> I took the initiative.
<s> The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
<s> Renard.
<s> Which is neutral, no doubt.
<s> Who did you get it from?
<s> Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
<s> Yes.
<s> Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
<s> Yes.
<s> You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
<s> ...you should rest.
<s> I have to go to work.
<s> Two. Shaken not stirred.
<s> You can drop the act, it’s over.
<s> You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
<s> Not interested.
<s> It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
<s> Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
<s> Oh James.
<s> BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
<s> Where did you get this?
<s> Please.
<s> And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
<s> Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
<s> Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
<s> I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
<s> Don't call me that.
<s> Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
<s> God isn't there to do it.
<s> We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
<s> You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
<s> Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
<s> . . . And just how would you manage that?
<s> Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
<s> Always.  Ever since the day I died.
<s> You're the only human being I care for.
<s> I won't do that.
<s> Cured, yes.
<s> Veidt¹s complex.
<s> Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
<s> The missing scientists.
<s> And what if you¹re wrong?
<s> What if you¹re wrong??
<s> Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
<s> Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
<s> He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
<s> Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
<s> I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
<s> Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
<s> That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
<s> What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
<s> Where did he go?
<s> Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
<s> Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
<s> Then why don't you ask him?!?
<s> What does this mean?  What does it --
<s> Jon??  You mean he's --
<s> Laurie!  Good to see you.
<s> I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
<s> ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
<s> No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
<s> Looks like a diner.
<s> Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
<s> You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
<s> I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
<s> Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
<s> Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
<s> Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
<s> I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
<s> Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
<s> Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
<s> Who says you're the good guys?
<s> We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
<s> I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
<s> I think we should send him whatever he wants.
<s> He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
<s> We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
<s> He gets to be the hero.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
<s> We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
<s> So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
<s> I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
<s> It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
<s> Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
<s> Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
<s> He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
<s> Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
<s> That one I'm real familiar with.
<s> Alright, so I'll get more.
<s> You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
<s> Is this what you're looking for?
<s> This pizda? Never seen him before.
<s> This is a gift. From me to you.
<s> Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
<s> I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
<s> You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
<s> Its core?
<s> I don't like him being here.
<s> His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
<s> It's too far.
<s> What if they're naughty?
<s> He takes his work seriously.
<s> Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
<s> Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
<s> I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
<s> The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
<s> They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
<s> What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
<s> The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
<s> She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
<s> Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
<s> Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
<s> WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
<s> Victor Frankenstein.
<s> Ugly, vicious rumous.
<s> Yes, sir?
<s> MMMmmmm.
<s> Is it that music?
<s> MMmmm.
<s> MMmmm.
<s> Of course.
<s> Yes.
<s> Darling!
<s> Surprised!
<s> Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
<s> Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
<s> You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
<s> Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
<s> Does that include the key to the laboratory?
<s> May I have it, please?
<s> Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
<s> This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
<s> A week.  Ten days at most.
<s> The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
<s> Dr. Fronkonsteen!
<s> You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
<s> But your grandfather's work, sir...
<s> You must be Igor.
<s> I'm sure we will.
<s> Why are you talking like that?
<s> Fro-derick!
<s> What?
<s> Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
<s> Tonight?
<s> What?
<s> careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
<s> You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
<s> ... I'm glad that's...
<s> I'll bet it's a doozy.
<s> Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
<s> Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
<s> Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
<s> All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
<s> Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
<s> Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
<s> I think you've done it, master.
<s> Not fooling around.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
<s> MMMMmmmmm!
<s> MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
<s> There must have been someone else down here then.
<s> Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
<s> Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
<s> Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
<s> Do Something!  Stall them!
<s> Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
