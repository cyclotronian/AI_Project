<s> Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
<s> Cameron.
<s> Let me see what I can do.
<s> That's because it's such a nice one.
<s> You're sweet.
<s> Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
<s> Is he oily or dry?
<s> Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
<s> Expensive?
<s> My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
<s> Can we go now?
<s> So did you
<s> And where're you going?
<s> The prom?  Kat has a date?
<s> You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
<s> Just sent 'em through.
<s> Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
<s> Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
<s> You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
<s> He seems like he thrives on danger
<s> That's what I just said
<s> Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
<s> No, I ' m not.
<s> Don't make me do it, man
<s> I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
<s> I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
<s> A deal's a deal.
<s> Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
<s> Are you lost?
<s> We're not.
<s> Patrick Verona   Random skid.
<s> Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
<s> I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
<s> Who?
<s> You know what they say
<s> Then why'd you ask?
<s> You 're so --
<s> I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
<s> Something like that
<s> I hate peas.
<s> Why not?
<s> Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
<s> I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
<s> I thought you were punishing me.
<s> The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
<s> So Dorsey can get the girl?
<s> Just for now.
<s> Sweet love, renew thy force!
<s> Tumescent!
<s> We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
<s> I know.
<s> They tried... but I didn't let them.
<s> Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
<s> Yes... I remember...
<s> Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
<s> There'll be a time.
<s> If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
<s> Call them.
<s> Thousands.
<s> He understands.
<s> You never learned how to speak my language.
<s> I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
<s> Damn God!
<s> I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
<s> You are bound by an oath, Father.
<s> Give me absolution.
<s> No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
<s> Thank you.
<s> My horse doesn't work.
<s> You will regret this.
<s> God be with us admiral.
<s> Then why?
<s> Where are we going?
<s> What's your cut?  How much?
<s> Give me another one, please.
<s> They won't until this is over.
<s> Divorced.
<s> Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
<s> When?
<s> You ready?
<s> Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
<s> I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
<s> Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
<s> He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
<s> No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
<s> Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
<s> Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
<s> Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
<s> Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
<s> There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
<s> You're Polish?
<s> Stay here.
<s> Better than one.
<s> I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
<s> Raw deal.
<s> You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
<s> Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
<s> Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
<s> Could be Leon's.
<s> No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
<s> Jesus Christ.
<s> The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
<s> Is there a problem?
<s> How long are you planning to stay?
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
<s> You said speak Czech!
<s> The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
<s> Shut up.  Look!
<s> Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
<s> Credit?
<s> You want the tape?  There it is!
<s> This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
<s> That's what it looks like to me.
<s> He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
<s> Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
<s> I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
<s> Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
<s> He knew all along.
<s> It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
<s> Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
<s> It's possible.
<s> I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
<s> Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
<s> No.
<s> Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
<s> And don't you worry about it.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> The antenna has to be replaced.
<s> I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
<s> I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
<s> No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
<s> In three days, darling, I hope.
<s> She's in the bathroom.
<s> Thank you, Daddy.
<s> Yes, Daddy.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'll bet it's a fortune.
<s> Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
<s> I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
<s> Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
<s> Certainly.
<s> How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
<s> Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
<s> Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
<s> I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
<s> No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
<s> Opening pod bay doors.
<s> Yeah, I've been busy.
<s> No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
<s> Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
<s> Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
<s> No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
<s> I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
<s> Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
<s> What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
<s> You're done.  End of story.
<s> Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
<s> Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
<s> Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
<s> Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
<s> Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
<s> She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
<s> You need five years training to handle a joint like...
<s> I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
<s> Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
<s> Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
<s> You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
<s> I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
<s> Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
<s> You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
<s> Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
<s> So you took the rest of the night off...
<s> Luther's on the move...
<s> I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
<s> I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
<s> Whatever play I maker just back me up.
<s> Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
<s> I lost them, that's what happened.
<s> Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
<s> Yeah.
<s> So do you...been a long day.
<s> I'm heading out. How about you?
<s> Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
<s> What?
<s> I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
<s> When? How?
<s> What'd you do?
<s> I guess he got the message...
<s> No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
<s> Jack?  What was that?
<s> We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
<s> Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
<s> Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
<s> That's no bull.
<s> What do you want?
<s> First, the money.
<s> Not bad, not bad.
<s> Naw, right here's okay.
<s> I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
<s> San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
<s> ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
<s> You noticed...
<s> Good luck..
<s> What is?
<s> Perfect.
<s> Who?
<s> Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
<s> Hey bud! Finger here.
<s> In your dreams! See you tonight!
<s> Leeloo..
<s> ...Leeloo.
<s> I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
<s> ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
<s> I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
<s> Have you pulled yourself together?
<s> Uh... not really.
<s> Got it...
<s> Why not?
<s> I thought you were divorced.
<s> Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
<s> OK, you can turn around!
<s> I'm so tired...
<s> You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
<s> Been here long?
<s> You gotta push the little yellow button...
<s> Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
<s> I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
<s> Gentlemen?
<s> "..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
<s> Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
<s> Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
<s> Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
<s> Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
<s> We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
<s> Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
<s> I love you.
<s> What's wrong?  Are you alright?
<s> I don't know.  I'm sorry...
<s> Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
<s> Don't...
<s> Mrs. Christian.
<s> I promised him to Machine.
<s> What can I do for you today?
<s> I'll consider it.
<s> Machine's in?
<s> Right here.
<s> Where are the women?
<s> Look, I don't know what this...
<s> Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
<s> What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
<s> Why don't they come to me?
<s> Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
<s> You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
<s> Don't bore me with that bullshit.
<s> Fuck you!
<s> I told you, I don't know.
<s> Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
<s> What the fuck do you want from me?
<s> Nobody saw you bring her in?
<s> I'm listening.
<s> That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
<s> Shut up.
<s> I'll risk it.
<s> I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
<s> Child pornography.
<s> You want me to come out there and play private eye?
<s> See ya.
<s> I try to be.
<s> Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
<s> You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
<s> The checks were for odd amounts...
<s> I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
<s> Will you let me look?
<s> No... no... no...
<s> I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
<s> She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
<s> No, you may not.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I can't find him.
<s> You could do worse.
<s> You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
<s> Extra money, huh?
<s> Then what else can we do?
<s> Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
<s> It was Freddy.
<s> Let me talk to you.
<s> Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
<s> I though Freddy was just an old town story.
<s> Don't worry, honey
<s> Huh?
<s> It's lonely in there, in my room.
<s> Been having bad dreams.
<s> She doesn't want me around
<s> Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
<s> He's inside you, where he hides.
<s> He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
<s> Yeah...I guess.
<s> No.  A deal's a deal.
<s> You sure you don't want a ride to work?
<s> I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
<s> Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
<s> What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
<s> Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
<s> I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
<s> Well we gotta do something!
<s> She must've fallen asleep at the table...
<s> No shit.
<s> You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
<s> Yeah...
<s> Two hours a day, six days a week.
<s> Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
<s> You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
<s> But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
<s> We'll have to look for them later.
<s> Oh it does???
<s> Seems to be all around...
<s> Right at our one-eyed friend!
<s> It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
<s> Your friend was to remain where he was!
<s> I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
<s> Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
<s> This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
<s> You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
<s> What is the Northcountry Development Association?
<s> Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
<s> Yeah. I know about that.
<s> Tell me.
<s> No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
<s> Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
<s> You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
<s> You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
<s> LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
<s> Shit.
<s> Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
<s> Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
<s> It belongs to Pop.
<s> Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> His son-in-law damn near killed me.
<s> It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
<s> Yeah. A few things.
<s> I'm fine, fine.
<s> Maybe.
<s> From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
<s> Said what?
<s> The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
<s> Good.
<s> I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
<s> It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
<s> When did she die?
<s> Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
<s> That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
<s> I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
<s> You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
<s> You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
<s> Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
<s> Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
<s> Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
<s> I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
<s> You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
<s> That's what you think.
<s> Jim... for godsake!
<s> Did we warn them off?
<s> He's busy being dead.
<s> We don't know that.
<s> That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
<s> An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
<s> My loyalty was never to my country.
<s> Roger.
<s> why did they do that?
<s> Where are we now?
<s> Copy, Air Force One.
<s> Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
<s> No.
<s> Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
<s> You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
<s> Hold on, Alice.
<s> Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> White House Situation room.
<s> Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
<s> Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
<s> Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
<s> We're hooked. Hove into position.
<s> I just wish it was that simple.
<s> Commissioner, Aquarius.
<s> Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
<s> You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
<s> Sir?
<s> Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
<s> And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
<s> If that's the way you want it.
<s> Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
<s> Let me by, Elaine.
<s> There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
<s> That was very well put, Ted.
<s> Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
<s> Compute!
<s> Simon.
<s> Simon, why has he become so... so...
<s> Roger.
<s> You can do it from up here, Captain.
<s> Negative.
<s> There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
<s> We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
<s> No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
<s> We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
<s> I don't want to hear that word!
<s> I don't want to live anymore.
<s> Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
<s> Do you have an appointment, sir?
<s> Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
<s> Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
<s> Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
<s> I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
<s> No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
<s> Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
<s> I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
<s> Can you fly this airplane and land it?
<s> Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
<s> Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
<s> I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
<s> But if you'll just give me...
<s> That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
<s> Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
<s> And a little ice.
<s> What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
<s> Yes?
<s> You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
<s> ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
<s> ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
<s> I'm Randy.
<s> Huh?
<s> Yeah...
<s> You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
<s> A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
<s> And still it fits?
<s> How the hell do you know that?
<s> Uh, Matthew...
<s> Stay back!  I'm okay.
<s> Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
<s> Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
<s> Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
<s> When will Strader return?
<s> Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
<s> My wife?  She worries about me.
<s> In the other man's rectum.
<s> Why?
<s> Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
<s> No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
<s> Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
<s> There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
<s> What is it?
<s> Who else can I ask around here?
<s> Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
<s> Ss'kya'ta'.
<s> Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
<s> Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
<s> Talk to me, Hudson.
<s> That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
<s> I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
<s> What?
<s> See you soon.
<s> Well, thanks, I --
<s> You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
<s> Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
<s> Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
<s> Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
<s> No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
<s> Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
<s> Corporal Hicks!?
<s> Sorry to disappoint you.
<s> Dead on all channels.
<s> Thirty-eight...simulated.
<s> All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
<s> Let's get these things lit.
<s> Fuckin' A!
<s> Poor bastard.
<s> Maybe.  Maybe not.
<s> Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
<s> The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
<s> We ain't going anywhere.
<s> Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
<s> Yeah.  What?
<s> How long have I been on Gateway station?
<s> Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
<s> I'm sorry, Newt.
<s> Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
<s> Look!
<s> It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
<s> At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
<s> Indeed.
<s> Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
<s> No.
<s> Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
<s> My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
<s> You were sublime.
<s> Extremely clever.
<s> Don't bother!
<s> What??
<s> But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
<s> Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
<s> How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
<s> Who the devil are you? What do you want?
<s> I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
<s> We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
<s> Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
<s> Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
<s> Em iram! Em iram!
<s> Eat my - ah!
<s> Stanzi!
<s> Why not? Half the house!
<s> I'm not telling you.
<s> Why?
<s> No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> In three months! Papa.
<s> But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
<s> Ah, now! Here she comes.
<s> You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
<s> You do me too much honour, Sire.
<s> Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
<s> Yes?
<s> Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
<s> Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
<s> Yes?
<s> Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
<s> You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
<s> In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
<s> Is she not here?
<s> How is your financial situation?
<s> Papa!
<s> Do any pupils come to the house?
<s> Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
<s> Really? What is it he's writing?
<s> Yes what?
<s> I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
<s> Are you Herr Mozart?
<s> No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
<s> What is this?
<s> If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
<s> Whom did they choose?
<s> You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
<s> Of course not.
<s> I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
<s> I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
<s> Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
<s> How could it not, Excellency?
<s> What dead? Who is dead?
<s> The doctor thinks I am. But -
<s> Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
<s> The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
<s> We ended in F Major?
<s> First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
<s> Yes!
<s> I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
<s> Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
<s> Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
<s> You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
<s> That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
<s> I regret it is not too familiar.
<s> I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
<s> God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
<s> The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
<s> I did.
<s> Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
<s> Yes?
<s> Exactly.
<s> Yes.
<s> Never mind.
<s> Incredible.
<s> What do you mean - now?
<s> Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
<s> I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
<s> Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> He's fine. We'll come right over.
<s> No, a cab will be faster.
<s> Tea would be nice.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Yes?
<s> I'm not very hungry, thank you.
<s> Please, really. I'm not hungry.
<s> I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
<s> I'm sorry I woke you up.
<s> No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
<s> I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
<s> Now I'm embarrassed.
<s> Of course.
<s> Werewolves simply do not exist.
<s> Yeah, I do, but go to work.
<s> I'm freezing.
<s> Pull over.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
<s> Has he been refusing food?
<s> Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
<s> This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
<s> You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
<s> Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
<s> Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
<s> Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
<s> You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
<s> Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
<s> Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
<s> I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
<s> We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
<s> I assume full responsibility.
<s> Wrong.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
<s> Do you think it's a dog?
<s> Walk away, Jack.
<s> Not far enough. Come on.
<s> Are you going to help me up?
<s> This is too much. I can't handle this.
<s> I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
<s> We were attacked by a werewolf.
<s> The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
<s> Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
<s> Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
<s> I wanted to see you.
<s> David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
<s> Thank you.
<s> Hello.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
<s> How much?
<s> Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
<s> It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not yet, Mr. Clark.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
<s> What about?
<s> That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
<s> Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
<s> I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
<s> I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
<s> Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
<s> Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
<s> Why, I needed a
<s> Line?
<s> But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
<s> Well, aren't you going to invite me?
<s> I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
<s> My apartment.
<s> Good for you. Come on.
<s> I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
<s> But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
<s> Tomorrow night?
<s> Where is he now?
<s> Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
<s> There you are.
<s> Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
<s> Were you in Cluett's apartment?
<s> I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
<s> Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
<s> Mine too?
<s> I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, he was making love to her.
<s> Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then where were you?
<s> I'm okay, Matt.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
<s> Sometimes a wound will kill.
<s> Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
<s> You stay out of this, Bob.
<s> Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
<s> Leave me alone, Bob.
<s> Two.
<s> Not yet. But I'm hoping.
<s> You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
<s> I think I recognize you.
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
<s> Sure, cousin.
<s> What will be?
<s> If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
<s> Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
<s> Which one, right or left?
<s> Sadie was not a man!
<s> All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
<s> I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
<s> All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
<s> Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
<s> Fine. How'd it go out here?
<s> And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
<s> I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
<s> Got any ideas, little brother?
<s> Jim was old enough...
<s> Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
<s> Yeah, Jimmy?
<s> But he killed a lot of men, too.
<s> Yeah Jimmy?
<s> Boys?
<s> Shush.
<s> You were little Jesse James when you left.
<s> I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
<s> A river pirate.
<s> And what's this right girl like?
<s> Where will you find such a girl?
<s> Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
<s> "Hmm" what?
<s> Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
<s> I'll explain on the way.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No.
<s> You been with a girl ever?
<s> This time we'll make an exception.
<s> I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
<s> Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
<s> I hope I'm not being too forward.
<s> I'm doing you folks a favor --
<s> Yes sir.
<s> How much did they get from the safe?
<s> I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
<s> We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
<s> Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
<s> I can't believe this.
<s> No.
<s> What is that?
<s> Stop it. I'm...
<s> Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
<s> Is that Donald Trump's car?
<s> Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
<s> I'm ignoring you.
<s> Turn the light on.
<s> Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
<s> I never knew you smoked.
<s> Yes?
<s> You just haven't been looking.
<s> Do...what.
<s> Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
<s> What are the rules for a sweater vest?
<s> How did you guess?
<s> Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
<s> No.
<s> No, he doesn't.
<s> Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
<s> Yes, naturally.
<s> Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
<s> But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
<s> No, you...didn't?
<s> I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
<s> Calm down. Let's do it anyway
<s> New card. What do you think?
<s> Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
<s> I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
<s> Oh really? That's great.
<s> See you then.
<s> I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
<s> When?
<s> Negative. Cancel it.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Come on, you're prettier than that.
<s> Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
<s> Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
<s> Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
<s> Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
<s> I'm on a diet. But thank you.
<s> You can always he thinner. Look...better.
<s> Growing. I'm glad you said that.
<s> Who's Ted Bundy?
<s> Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
<s> Jean-I'm not-
<s> No. I really don't.
<s> Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
<s> Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
<s> Shoot.
<s> Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
<s> I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
<s> No. Not really.
<s> Well, maybe he did, huh?
<s> Oh.
<s> It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
<s> Eerie. Really eerie.
<s> Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
<s> Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
<s> Marcus?
<s> But Marcus denied it?
<s> Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
<s> I'm so hungry.
<s> Oh well, you know.
<s> Another Martini, Paul?
<s> Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
<s> Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
<s> What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
<s> I know, I know.
<s> Isn't that -- extreme?
<s> Milo. Why would he --
<s> Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
<s> You can't just walk in, either.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
<s> I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
<s> Don't we have any chopsticks?
<s> It's gonna get cold.
<s> Right... What's that mean again?
<s> 'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
<s> Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
<s> We tried!
<s> I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
<s> Low enough to relay internet traffic.
<s> ...Do I?
<s> Maybe I'm going too fast.
<s> Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
<s> Well -- you sent for me.
<s> Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
<s> 'Have a look?
<s> I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
<s> Let's go.
<s> You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
<s> He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
<s> Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
<s> Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
<s> Keep looking.
<s> They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
<s> I'm calling Gary.
<s> Where we going?
<s> I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
<s> No. Please.
<s> Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
<s> They'd frame him.
<s> There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
<s> What?
<s> You mean -- break in?
<s> Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
<s> 'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
<s> The dishes are juiced up, too.
<s> Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
<s> He doesn't know about the Day Care.
<s> That's lame, isn't it?
<s> She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
<s> It's three years old, it --
<s> But you said the other --
<s> Jesus, Teddy.
<s> I met this girl.
<s> His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
<s> Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
<s> I could get it out of him.
<s> Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
<s> Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
<s> I'd rather talk about Number Two.
<s> Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
<s> Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
<s> Hey, how are you?
<s> Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
<s> Thanks.
<s> There's one more thing, Austin.
<s> That's not your mother, that's a man!
<s> I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
<s> Yes Basil?
<s> Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
<s> Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
<s> No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
<s> Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
<s> Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
<s> No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
<s> Why?
<s> Of course, luv.
<s> Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
<s> I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
<s> Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
<s> Not now, Austin.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
<s> Lay it on me.
<s> No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
<s> Is it one of ours?
<s> Silence!
<s> Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
<s> Thank you, Herr Doctor.
<s> Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
<s> Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
<s> But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
<s> Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
<s> Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
<s> You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
<s> Of course not. I was married to your father.
<s> I don't wanna take over the family business.
<s> You don't say. How real does it feel?
<s> No need. I'll call again.
<s> ... preserve...
<s> Mr. John Steed, please.
<s> Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
<s> The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
<s> To find out who killed my husband.
<s> You killed my husband.
<s> Too many cooks --
<s> Valentine, listen to me ...
<s> Ring?
<s> What are my choices?
<s> I had a spot of bother at the door.
<s> Rules are made to be broken.
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
<s> As per mother's instructions.
<s> For a man in my position --
<s> I meant me.
<s> Is that written in his shoe?
<s> Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
<s> ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
<s> Not for a moment.
<s> I thought you didn't.
<s> It's called Black Leather.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> What kept you?
<s> Still a bit chilly ...
<s> Have you any place in mind?
<s> You're saying I have no choice.
<s> Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
<s> No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
<s> Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
<s> Walk over to the window ...
<s> Debbie's marrying Rick.
<s> They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
<s> We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
<s> Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
<s> Ooh, be still, my heart.
<s> Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
<s> Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
<s> But how can I do that?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
<s> You're going to have a bachelor party?
<s> Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
<s> Good...
<s> Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
<s> You better not have too much joy.
<s> Gonna get married...
<s> Can't I just go with you guys?
<s> You're so romantic...
<s> Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
<s> Let's see your bread.
<s> They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
<s> Why?
<s> This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
<s> I'll take some.
<s> Larry, you and your wife got problems?
<s> What do you mean, it changes?
<s> C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
<s> I couldn't find any razor blades.
<s> This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
<s> Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
<s> First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
<s> The phone made me do it!
<s> Of course.
<s> Nothing... Let's get crazy!
<s> Olivier's in that, right?
<s> I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
<s> If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
<s> Still drawing a blank.
<s> Take care.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Maybe I did... I don't remember.
<s> Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
<s> No.  I need a drink.
<s> My Lt. might have something to say about that.
<s> Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
<s> I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
<s> Hey! You don't know me --
<s> So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
<s> Thanks for the speakers.
<s> Hey.
<s> Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
<s> Thanks for the insight.
<s> I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
<s> So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
<s> When I was twenty.
<s> So now you suddenly care about my future?
<s> How's it going?
<s> Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
<s> I don't have the slightest idea...
<s> So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
<s> Who's doing this?
<s> I don't have a story.
<s> -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
<s> Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
<s> Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
<s> Pest control.
<s> I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
<s> "Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
<s> Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
<s> But he killed these guys.
<s> Like it never happened...
<s> You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
<s> What the hell are we waiting for?
<s> Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
<s> There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
<s> Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
<s> -- You remember.
<s> Okay.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Tell him about me, Shadow?
<s> Did he tell you how we finally met?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> "Don?"
<s> Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
<s> Investigator...
<s> This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
<s> "The Strawberries"?
<s> I'm a Catholic.
<s> Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
<s> You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
<s> Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
<s> All right, cop. I want my money.
<s> How about 7 1/2?
<s> You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
<s> I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
<s> Yes, Sister?
<s> How 'bout...
<s> Did he gots to be.
<s> Ho!
<s> And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
<s> Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
<s> Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
<s> Different.
<s> You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
<s> We might need some mo' money behind this.
<s> Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
<s> Some tap dancing, some singing.
<s> I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
<s> I'm wid it.
<s> Go on.  Good so far.
<s> What are there character traits?
<s> Exactly!
<s> And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
<s> Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
<s> We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
<s> They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
<s> Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
<s> Where do you go from here?
<s> I didn't mean that, in life.
<s> The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
<s> Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
<s> It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
<s> Which one is your brother?
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
<s> A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
<s> I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
<s> Light?
<s> You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
<s> Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
<s> What you did is dead wrong.
<s> My name is Manray, goddamnit.
<s> It looks delicious.
<s> Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
<s> What's a Negro.
<s> Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
<s> Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
<s> We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
<s> I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
<s> I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
<s> I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
<s> And this is my very best friend Mantan.
<s> Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
<s> You tellin' the truth.
<s> The one with da big...
<s> So when are you comin' to pick us up?
<s> Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
<s> Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
<s> Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
<s> Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
<s> Say what, Manray?
<s> Good morning.
<s> Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
<s> The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
<s> I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
<s> And his baggage?
<s> It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
<s> Is Miss Dugan well?
<s> Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
<s> On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
<s> Have you not a man whom you value?
<s> Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
<s> To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
<s> Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
<s> Old fool!
<s> As much as possible.
<s> Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
<s> The Prince left him only that choice.
<s> That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
<s> You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
<s> Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
<s> Good night, my little darling.
<s> Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
<s> I'm -- I'm sorry...
<s> Can anybody hear me!
<s> We don't know. West is dead.
<s> We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
<s> It's... too slow.
<s> C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
<s> This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
<s> Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
<s> I didn't shoot West --
<s> Epilepsy.
<s> The creek bed --
<s> Would you have believed me?
<s> Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
<s> Sir, Dunbar, sir!
<s> Your weapons, Sergeant.
<s> I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
<s> You're lying --
<s> That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
<s> No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
<s> Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
<s> There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
<s> So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
<s> Well?
<s> Maybe --
<s> He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
<s> From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
<s> What the hell are you talking about --
<s> Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
<s> Does Osborne agree?
<s> Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
<s> Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
<s> Best time for banal chit-chat.
<s> You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
<s> The very same.
<s> I plan to grow on you.
<s> I don't think that has anything to do with --
<s> Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
<s> What?
<s> And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
<s> You wanted to get the truth.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
<s> Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
<s> Good, just making sure.
<s> Get in.
<s> Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
<s> Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
<s> Think it'll work?
<s> Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
<s> Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
<s> Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
<s> No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
<s> Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
<s> He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
<s> The fuck are you talking about --
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> That's great.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Why?
<s> I brought it.
<s> Don.
<s> I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
<s> That's terrible.
<s> I like your stories.
<s> Make him stop.
<s> Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
<s> Really.
<s> Really.
<s> Can we talk?
<s> Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
<s> I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
<s> Yes. Exactly.
<s> Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
<s> I have the rest of my life to find out.
<s> I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
<s> I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
<s> Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
<s> My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
<s> No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
<s> Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
<s> I need to lie down for a bit.
<s> Did you?
<s> That's because most of it never happened.
<s> Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
<s> We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
<s> Of course.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
<s> Yes. Thank you.
<s> Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
<s> What for?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> We'll stop then.
<s> Ch...
<s> Uh... Yes.
<s> I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
<s> I'm asking what you're here for.
<s> I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
<s> Uh. Do you like England?
<s> No. It is too judgmental.
<s> Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
<s> What? What does he want?
<s> It's makes it easier. Okay.
<s> It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
<s> It's none of your business.
<s> You...
<s> You didn't mind too much.
<s> Get out.
<s> You don't have to say anything
<s> What?
<s> Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
<s> It's alright.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
<s> Yes?
<s> I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
<s> Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
<s> I need ya help again.
<s> You seen my snake-skin shoes?
<s> You been home yet?
<s> You need a ride?
<s> I got others.
<s> I begged him not to go. And he did.
<s> Careful how you point that gun, boy.
<s> You sayin' you'll do what?
<s> Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
<s> GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
<s> Well I don't...
<s> Don't need none.
<s> Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
<s> In my house, you watch that lip...
<s> You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> The... chain helps.
<s> You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> What'chu sayin'?
<s> You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
<s> Don't know if God wanna see me.
<s> Ain't gonna be moved?
<s> I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
<s> I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
<s> I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
<s> Yes'sir.
<s> So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
<s> Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
<s> Rae don't do this now...
<s> All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
<s> Ronnie...
<s> All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
<s> -- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
<s> Let go...
<s> Get rid of it.
<s> Charlie...
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> Where is the subway station, please.
<s> Hey, when in Rome --
<s> He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
<s> What'd she say?
<s> What's the problem here?
<s> I stole them.
<s> We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
<s> You can trust me.
<s> Shut-up.
<s> Let's go.  Him first.
<s> I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
<s> I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
<s> I couldn't tell.
<s> Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
<s> Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
<s> It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
<s> He drinks.
<s> No one's keeping him here.
<s> Why?
<s> Look.
<s> The families who control the casinos?
<s> We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
<s> If he won't cooperate?
<s> It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
<s> What about E.M.S. recombination?
<s> You're just all so... so different.
<s> Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
<s> Garbage man?
<s> Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
<s> Day after tomorrow.
<s> Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
<s> I gotta piss.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm taking a piss.
<s> These aren't just...
<s> Yeah?
<s> Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
<s> Of course.
<s> Do you recognize any of them?
<s> Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
<s> I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
<s> Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You mean a woman?
<s> Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Don't move.
<s> I don't have one.
<s> I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
<s> We sure did.
<s> What's that?
<s> No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
<s> How do you do?
<s> Oh, brother...
<s> Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
<s> Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
<s> A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
<s> I just had a mental picture of...
<s> Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
<s> Rogers Hornsby?!?
<s> Hey, no kidding?  In color?
<s> My Mom and Dad.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Oh, I'm sure it will!
<s> A wife?
<s> The big one!
<s> Everybody's divorced.
<s> Yes, ma'am!
<s> Um-hum.
<s> Yes!
<s> Uh...yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Look unimpressed.
<s> Do I look crazy?
<s> Goodnight!
<s> It was at least as good as the sky.
<s> And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
<s> See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
<s> What?
<s> Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
<s> Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
<s> The front door is open.  Will you be back?
<s> Gerade aus dann links!
<s> Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
<s> It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
<s> Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
<s> Shit is a French word?
<s> Yes, sir.  Is that all?
<s> And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
<s> Uh, I think they have.
<s> Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
<s> Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You don't have a computer in your cabin?
<s> True.
<s> No.
<s> Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
<s> Okay. Thank you, my friends.
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
<s> Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
<s> How do you do, ma'am.
<s> Good!
<s> Yes.
<s> Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
<s> And now you must let me be the judge of that!
<s> Yeah.
<s> The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
<s> Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
<s> You bet, hon!
<s> I never know anymore.
<s> Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
<s> I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
<s> The locks.
<s> To go up.
<s> Would you like a tranquilizer?
<s> No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
<s> What shall we call him?
<s> And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
<s> What?
<s> Coming!
<s> You bet.
<s> If he tells, it won't come true!
<s> It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
<s> I don't believe it!
<s> We do?
<s> --and we will--
<s> Yes, dear, I know.
<s> I thought ten years.
<s> To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
<s> Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
<s> Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
<s> I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
<s> He's from Alaska.
<s> Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
<s> He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
<s> Coward!
<s> What?!
<s> Give it back to him.
<s> You didn't stop anywhere else?!
<s> Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
<s> Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
<s> Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
<s> Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
<s> Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
<s> Yes?
<s> Okay.
<s> It's blue. Blue velvet.
<s> I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
<s> Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
<s> Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
<s> You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
<s> Then you got undressed.
<s> Never before this.
<s> I, I don't know.
<s> It's okay. It's okay.
<s> See my nipples?
<s> You don't?
<s> Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
<s> Yeah, hurry up though.
<s> Same here.
<s> I sure don't hate you.
<s> What if Frank came over here and found us?
<s> No, it's not Don.
<s> You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
<s> Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
<s> I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
<s> Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
<s> Who, Dorothy?
<s> Oh he forced you, huh?
<s> No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
<s> Those are my breasts.
<s> If you want to.
<s> FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
<s> Nothing.
<s> Be right down.
<s> Jeffrey, when you see your father.
<s> Do you want the car?
<s> Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
<s> I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
<s> Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
<s> Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
<s> I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
<s> I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
<s> Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
<s> I'll drink to that.
<s> I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
<s> Look, it can wait till Sunday.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> No way. I'm about to blow up.
<s> I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
<s> I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
<s> Okay, Sandy.
<s> You want to go talk to him?
<s> Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
<s> Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
<s> What is it?
<s> I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
<s> Let's wait for some slow one.
<s> Shhh. I'll tell you.
<s> Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
<s> Yeah, nice meetin' you.
<s> Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
<s> Stop it Mike.
<s> Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
<s> Go find one.
<s> Mother Mary, full of grace.
<s> Aye.
<s> Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
<s> Any tips on where these guys may be?
<s> What?
<s> You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
<s> Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
<s> He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
<s> He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
<s> What happened?
<s> Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
<s> You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
<s> Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
<s> Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
<s> Our mother can see through bags.
<s> Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
<s> Italian.
<s> No pictures, either.
<s> For what?
<s> Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
<s> Holy shit. Who? How many?
<s> Okay then... let's get ya started.
<s> Of course they were. How many?
<s> No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
<s> How do you figure?
<s> Where's my cat?
<s> You killed my... my...
<s> My, my...
<s> What?
<s> Witness?
<s> I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
<s> I...
<s> Hallelujah, Jaffar.
<s> Hey, Murph.
<s> Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
<s> Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
<s> We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
<s> Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
<s> You believe?
<s> You feel?
<s> Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
<s> Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
<s> You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
<s> Yeah, I saw it.
<s> Yeah, I heard that.
<s> No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
<s> Because my mom gets the bill.
<s> I don't want to use it.
<s> What. What's the matter?
<s> No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
<s> This was in fourth grade.
<s> You were asleep.
<s> Would of been nice.
<s> What?
<s> I know.
<s> What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
<s> Let me feel that.
<s> Did that hurt?
<s> Hang on a second.
<s> Good. It's supposed to be.
<s> It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Dignan, I --
<s> I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
<s> See you, Bob.
<s> Is that OK?
<s> Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
<s> Cuba.
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
<s> I don't know about that.
<s> It seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
<s> I thought your parents were in Italy.
<s> So who's going to know?
<s> Yes. I did.
<s> I'll just drive my car.
<s> You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
<s> I can't believe you said that.
<s> No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
<s> Well, don't blame me. I told you.
<s> His name was Swifty?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> I don't know.
<s> See you in a little while.
<s> But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
<s> I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
<s> Well, obviously, we got to go back.
<s> Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
<s> I can't do that, Bob.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Where's Applejack?
<s> Now!
<s> I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
<s> The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
<s> Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
<s> Well, I left some money in there.
<s> No. I just have short hair.
<s> Mr. Henry?
<s> It's locked.
<s> Will it track back to us?
<s> Never heard of it.
<s> What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
<s> ...this is Conklin's computer.
<s> And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
<s> It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
<s> They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
<s> I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
<s> 'Why' would be enough for me.
<s> No, I do.
<s> You killed them.
<s> Is this really happening?
<s> Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
<s> I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
<s> It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
<s> Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
<s> No. You never worked Berlin.
<s> Your first assignment was Geneva.
<s> I want to come in.
<s> Are you disappointed?
<s> What's that?
<s> Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
<s> -- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
<s> What?
<s> Is there. Is all there.
<s> That's where we came out.
<s> Who's this?
<s> Are we hacking or asking?
<s> We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
<s> My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
<s> You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
<s> Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
<s> You mock us with a smile?
<s> Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
<s> Aye, we'll get 'em.
<s> I will not.
<s> He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
<s> He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
<s> Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
<s> You are. And I'll come again.
<s> Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
<s> No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
<s> A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
<s> She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
<s> Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
<s> We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
<s> I am trying.
<s> I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
<s> What is it?
<s> A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
<s> Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
<s> So what did you find.
<s> Okay.
<s> Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
<s> How long will I be in here?
<s> Fix?
<s> Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
<s> Shit. I knew you were crazy.
<s> Weirder than this?
<s> Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
<s> You know my father?
<s> Yes.
<s> Are you sure? Not even with my father?
<s> Where are my goddamn books?
<s> Huh?
<s> He must be. They're letting him go, right?
<s> What do you want to know, Evan?
<s> You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
<s> Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
<s> Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
<s> Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
<s> I walk differently?
<s> I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
<s> Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
<s> Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
<s> That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
<s> That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
<s> Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
<s> Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
<s> Deal. Now read me something.
<s> It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
<s> Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
<s> It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
<s> Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
<s> You're such a retard!
<s> What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
<s> -- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
<s> Oh, yes, please.
<s> Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
<s> Well?
<s> Yes, Monsieur.
<s> As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
<s> I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
<s> Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
<s> I don't buy or sell human beings.
<s> I'll tell him when he comes in.
<s> Well, so long.
<s> Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
<s> He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
<s> What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
<s> And the other alternative?
<s> He hasn't played it in a long time.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
<s> -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
<s> All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
<s> I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't have to. I've got them right here.
<s> Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
<s> Because you're getting on that plane.
<s> I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
<s> But what about us?
<s> She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
<s> Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
<s> If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
<s> Be careful.
<s> Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
<s> And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
<s> But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
<s> I love you very much, my dear.
<s> And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
<s> Thank you. I try.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Here it is.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
<s> Good day.
<s> Champagne and a tin of caviar.
<s> How about New York?
<s> I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
<s> If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
<s> It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
<s> -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
<s> -- Hello, Ilsa.
<s> You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
<s> Oh, he won't be followed here.
<s> Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
<s> You think of everything, don't you?
<s> Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
<s> Take your hands off me!
<s> Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
<s> Put that phone down!
<s> No.
<s> I like it fine here.
<s> Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
<s> Just a little something of my own.
<s> No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
<s> Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
<s> Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
<s> It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
<s> No.
<s> He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
<s> We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
<s> It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
<s> Yes there is.
<s> That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
<s> Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
<s> That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
<s> It means a lot...that you came.
<s> There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
<s> Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
<s> That new roof, that's your doing.
<s> This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
<s> Can you find her?
<s> Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
<s> Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
<s> The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
<s> You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
<s> Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
<s> I braided them.
<s> Believe me I know.
<s> Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
<s> Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
<s> Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
<s> "An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
<s> It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
<s> He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
<s> What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
<s> If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
<s> I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
<s> Daddy, *please*...
<s> Really?
<s> Sure... I'll see you around.
<s> When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
<s> I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
<s> I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
<s> Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
<s> So we should "wait and see." For how long?
<s> Hi...
<s> I never said they were boring.
<s> Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
<s> Is that soon?
<s> Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
<s> A B-24 Liberator.
<s> The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
<s> Actually, I volunteered.
<s> Migrants?
<s> Right.
<s> I guess so...
<s> Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
<s> This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
<s> Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
<s> You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
<s> Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
<s> It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
<s> How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
<s> You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
<s> Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
<s> Right.
<s> How long's this been going on, Muddy?
<s> They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
<s> Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
<s> *You* taught her, I suppose...
<s> That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
<s> You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
<s> She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
<s> I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
<s> We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
<s> Everything looks in order.
<s> That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
<s> My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
<s> Today? Started off great...
<s> We sure Big Al threw him to us?
<s> Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
<s> We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
<s> And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
<s> What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
<s> You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
<s> Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
<s> All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
<s> Very much so.
<s> Just play a part. A little acting.
<s> You're just going to have to trust me.
<s> Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
<s> Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
<s> You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
<s> Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
<s> Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
<s> What do you want? An apology?
<s> Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
<s> No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
<s> You sure?
<s> Where the hell is she?
<s> You going to have the time?
<s> My fucking heart bleeds.
<s> Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
<s> Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
<s> It's not history.
<s> You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
<s> I try.
<s> Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
<s> We're here.
<s> I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
<s> Whoa, whoa... There he is.
<s> Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
<s> I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
<s> I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
<s> Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
<s> She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
<s> I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Tension. It'll go.
<s> Marion, stop this.
<s> Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
<s> -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
<s> Then what?
<s> I hate public transport.
<s> Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
<s> All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
<s> That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
<s> There's a casino in this hotel.
<s> So why did you come to my casino?
<s> Your father?
<s> And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> Just an accident. Nothing.
<s> I'll watch.
<s> Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
<s> Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
<s> Wait a minute...
<s> No thank you.
<s> Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
<s> And what do you do, Lucy?
<s> Nice car.
<s> What the fuck are you talking about?
<s> You're talking about complicity.
<s> Give me 365.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
<s> Fine.
<s> Does he win?
<s> I hope it's not the oven again.
<s> I think he's talking to it.
<s> We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
<s> Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
<s> It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
<s> Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
<s> I read the same here.
<s> Check at six minutes.
<s> And I saw that I was alone.
<s> I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> Yes, Doolittle.
<s> Any of 'em any good?
<s> Who cares. Don't bother me.
<s> Who cares?
<s> Ah, negative drop.
<s> I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
<s> Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
<s> Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
<s> No kidding?
<s> I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
<s> Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
<s> What was that, Doolittle?
<s> It didn't work?
<s> Well, what you might try is --
<s> Sorry.
<s> Talk to the bomb.
<s> How I make my living, what's your point?
<s> Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
<s> I like to keep it professional, that's all.
<s> That's not why we're here.
<s> But the boss knows I always been loyal.
<s> Where?
<s> And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
<s> Don't look down.
<s> It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
<s> Later.
<s> And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
<s> Can you help me get her back?
<s> Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
<s> Hello...
<s> Girl's gotta make a living.
<s> Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
<s> Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
<s> Too early to tell.
<s> Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
<s> People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
<s> You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
<s> Yes on all counts.
<s> On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
<s> And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
<s> Zack... He made it... He's alive...
<s> You're also a fool.
<s> Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
<s> Here's your money.
<s> How's this about me?
<s> Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
<s> Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
<s> Not right now?  Okay, when?
<s> Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
<s> She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
<s> I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
<s> Exactly.
<s> You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
<s> You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
<s> Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
<s> Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
<s> Right, slow...
<s> What? That's disgusting!
<s> You got in the car, didn't you?
<s> Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
<s> Disco blows dogs for quarters.
<s> One more time in English.
<s> Plenty, but it was all bad.
<s> Curly.
<s> Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
<s> And if it ain't cleaned off?
<s> Sure.
<s> Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
<s> I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
<s> What's gone?
<s> I'm really sorry about that, man.
<s> Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
<s> See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
<s> Uhh... nothing.
<s> Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
<s> Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
<s> All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
<s> Not if I shoot first!
<s> Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
<s> He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
<s> A metal craft of any kind.
<s> If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
<s> You'll know soon enough.
<s> I am so sorry.
<s> He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
<s> No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
<s> And you'd never been there before?
<s> You want to kiss me...
<s> No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
<s> What?
<s> And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
<s> The whole movie. Let's go.
<s> What's wrong with you?
<s> Where is she?
<s> There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
<s> If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
<s> Do you get to meet Ed?
<s> So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
<s> Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
<s> I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
<s> Would you like to talk about this friend?
<s> He said to follow him.
<s> I think about girls a lot.
<s> I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
<s> It reminded me of my dog Callie.
<s> It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
<s> The good stuff.
<s> You've done it again?
<s> Why?
<s> Where are we going?
<s> Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
<s> It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
<s> Soon. Time is almost up.
<s> If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
<s> Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
<s> You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
<s> Because you tell Mom everything.
<s> What I think is going on with your son.
<s> You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
<s> But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
<s> Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
<s> It is a big deal.
<s> What else?
<s> I guess they made him do it.
<s> Beg pardon?
<s> But now you can't go.
<s> Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
<s> You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
<s> Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
<s> I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
<s> Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
<s> My mom wanted me to have this?
<s> Loretta, never have kids.
<s> Really?
<s> Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
<s> Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
<s> They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
<s> I love you much.
<s> Bye.
<s> Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
<s> You could be quiet.
<s> Hi.
<s> Oh, naw. Hi.
<s> All right, they're makin' a movie.
<s> The important thing is that we have a winner...
<s> This pageant's like a roach motel.
<s> You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
<s> "Proud... to be... an... American."
<s> Uh, Gladys?
<s> Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
<s> What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
<s> And everything.  He should be king!
<s> "My dear President"...
<s> "My"...
<s> Is that all?
<s> Send for my car...
<s> I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
<s> I wanna powder my nose...
<s> If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
<s> In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
<s> What do I get?
<s> That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
<s> You told it to me.
<s> By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
<s> That's not bad for any day.
<s> We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
<s> That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
<s> That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
<s> All right -- I'll go out and find one.
<s> I can't do it right away.
<s> If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
<s> Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
<s> Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
<s> No, that wasn't it...
<s> Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
<s> All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
<s> Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
<s> WHAT  ?
<s> You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
<s> Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
<s> I didn't come here to be insulted.
<s> I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
<s> But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
<s> Yes?
<s> I intend to.
<s> He fell.  He falls.
<s> Everything will be seen to.
<s> He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
<s> You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
<s> No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> No, more of an acquaintance.
<s> Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
<s> Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
<s> Well, yes.
<s> Do you think they'll go along with us?
<s> Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
<s> I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
<s> I feel much better. Thank you.
<s> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
<s> What a mess.
<s> I don't know what I've got.
<s> He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
<s> Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
<s> It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
<s> That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
<s> Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
<s> Oh no?
<s> I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
<s> Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
<s> Say "Mmmerrick."
<s> Hello, my name is John Merrick.
<s> But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
<s> Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
<s> Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
<s> That's a canopy, John.
<s> Oh, our relatives... the children.
<s> Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
<s> Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
<s> You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
<s> Yes, very soon.
<s> I've heard.
<s> Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
<s> Yes. John wants it.
<s> Welcome home, John.
<s> Handsomely?... Who sent you?
<s> Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
<s> Who, Father?
<s> Yes.
<s> What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
<s> Why?
<s> Goodbye, Aud...
<s> I shouldn't have come.
<s> Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
<s> That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
<s> I'm sure it's lovely.
<s> YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
<s> Yes?
<s> I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
<s> Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
<s> And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
<s> Aaagh! Rape!
<s> I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
<s> Well... no...
<s> You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
<s> But...
<s> No.
<s> Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
<s> No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
<s> I've got you!
<s> Keitel Blacksmith?
<s> What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
<s> Bye... sorry...
<s> The Dragon...
<s> Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
<s> Well... I... I thought...
<s> No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
<s> Like you got rid of Snorri!
<s> But it's a responsibility...
<s> I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
<s> It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
<s> Stop it!
<s> Sh!
<s> Easy, Dad!
<s> You liar!
<s> Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
<s> Yes, Mother.
<s> No, Mother.
<s> Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
<s> She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
<s> They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
<s> Just a little overworked, maybe.
<s> Okay, I guess.
<s> I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
<s> Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
<s> I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
<s> You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
<s> Why?
<s> Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
<s> No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
<s> Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
<s> Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
<s> My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
<s> Well, anyway... Sorry.
<s> That's okay.
<s> You're not a stalker or anything, right?
<s> Well, I wouldn't want to be --
<s> Very much.
<s> I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
<s> I'm fine.
<s> No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
<s> Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
<s> I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
<s> It's three.
<s> ...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
<s> I don't want to talk about this here.
<s> I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
<s> No.
<s> Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
<s> I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
<s> Naomi, I guess.
<s> What was I wearing?
<s> Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
<s> Not yet. Not married.
<s> I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
<s> It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
<s> I know.
<s> Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
<s> I love her.
<s> I think she's great.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> Well, you obviously don't know me.
<s> That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
<s> I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
<s> Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
<s> Hi.
<s> Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
<s> And what are you like? A wino?
<s> I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
<s> Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
<s> In a minute.
<s> I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
<s> I miss you.
<s> Oh! Great. That's great!
<s> I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
<s> We'll speak soon.
<s> Nah, I don't know.
<s> Sorry. I just --
<s> You found us okay?
<s> Well, what should we do?
<s> Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
<s> How did I look?
<s> That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
<s> Oh dear.
<s> Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
<s> She was unconscious, Patrick.
<s> Patrick, we're in the middle of --
<s> Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
<s> Easy come, easy go.
<s> You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
<s> Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
<s> FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
<s> Like what?
<s> What guy?
<s> Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
<s> My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
<s> A born freak can only go uphill.
<s> Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
<s> Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
<s> Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
<s> I don't know anything about it.
<s> Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
<s> EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
<s> Coop, where are you...
<s> On my way.
<s> Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
<s> No, he didn't.
<s> I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
<s> His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
<s> We'll make it.
<s> No.
<s> Nothing. It's nothing.
<s> He's crashing...
<s> You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
<s> The dark inside me.
<s> The crew? Could they still be alive?
<s> Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
<s> No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
<s> What you got, Peters?
<s> The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
<s> Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
<s> Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
<s> In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
<s> They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
<s> One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
<s> I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
<s> What makes you think I'll miss?
<s> I'm not the Devil.
<s> Better if I just show you.
<s> That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
<s> I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
<s> What is it, Smith?
<s> Come again, Skipper?
<s> How much oh-two do we have?
<s> Carbon dioxide?
<s> "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
<s> Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
<s> Blow it up?
<s> ...repeat, we're armed...
<s> Wasn't that ship destroyed?
<s> They're explosive charges.
<s> Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
<s> We're losing atmosphere...
<s> I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
<s> Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
<s> Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
<s> It wants me. I have to go.
<s> The forward airlock.
<s> Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
<s> I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
<s> Victor must've taken him.
<s> And you can? Power it up?
<s> Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
<s> Victor's better at these things.
<s> Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
<s> I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
<s> Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
<s> 'Course not. Strictly business.
<s> Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
<s> Put your tiny little mind at ease.
<s> Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
<s> Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
<s> Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<s> Not this again --
<s> What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
<s> Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
<s> Okay, "mom."
<s> I think that thing is Ben.
<s> Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
<s> You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
<s> History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
<s> Never better.
<s> What...?  Oh.
<s> What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> I think it was a little more complicated than --
<s> You need a doctor.
<s> It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<s> Ben did this.
<s> Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
<s> Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
<s> Susan. What are you doing?
<s> I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
<s> If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
<s> Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
<s> Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
<s> No. I want my money back right now.
<s> U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
<s> I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
<s> Maybe yes. Maybe no.
<s> It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
<s> Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
<s> What a guy.
<s> Sure. Come on in.
<s> Come on...
<s> We've got to get an abortion?
<s> Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
<s> What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
<s> All right. Pay attention.
<s> I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
<s> Damone. It's Mark.
<s> It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
<s> Damone! You come here?
<s> Okay. See ya.
<s> Whatever you say, Rat.
<s> All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
<s> You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
<s> Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
<s> It was okay.
<s> Not since November.
<s> Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
<s> Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
<s> Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
<s> He's not coming.
<s> What class?
<s> Yes.
<s> Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
<s> Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
<s> All right! Oh, yeah!
<s> Aloha, Spicoli.
<s> I don't know. Wherever you want.
<s> We keep them, in case the people come back.
<s> Yeah. She is pretty good.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
<s> Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
<s> Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
<s> Do you really have to go?
<s> Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
<s> I'll get you the notes.
<s> I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
<s> Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
<s> Not for me.
<s> Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
<s> IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
<s> Not where we operate.
<s> You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
<s> This is my granddaughter...
<s> It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
<s> My heart!
<s> God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
<s> Not yet. I want to study its habits.
<s> Why what?
<s> What for?
<s> He told me he was turning in early...
<s> I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
<s> How about a check?
<s> BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
<s> You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
<s> In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
<s> You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
<s> We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
<s> I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
<s> Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
<s> Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
<s> They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
<s> They were all veterans.
<s> I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
<s> Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
<s> FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
<s> Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
<s> Never missed a plane yet.
<s> Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
<s> One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
<s> You and a lot of other people.
<s> Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
<s> They'll get in! We'll all die!
<s> They'll be back.
<s> Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nah, I got the gun.
<s> But it's got teeth.
<s> I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
<s> Who the hell would you call?
<s> We're lucky to be alive.
<s> Hey!
<s> Follow me.
<s> Shit!
<s> Anyone else?
<s> Just cover me. It was built to move.
<s> Magic potion.  You should try a little.
<s> Sure.
<s> He only shot you once.
<s> What?
<s> They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
<s> F-f-fuck you.
<s> No bullshit.
<s> Duh hickey.
<s> Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
<s> Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
<s> Nothing, just lookin'.
<s> That's fine.
<s> Whoa!
<s> GO-GO-GO!!
<s> All right.
<s> Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
<s> This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
<s> I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
<s> I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
<s> That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
<s> Who's this?
<s> My clothes?
<s> Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
<s> God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
<s> No?
<s> What night?
<s> You want his name?
<s> Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
<s> Really?
<s> Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
<s> You really want to go?
<s> And you think it's worth all this?
<s> I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
<s> I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
<s> As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
<s> I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
<s> I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
<s> ...Not if I can help it.
<s> Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
<s> Quietly.
<s> What happened to him?
<s> ...So you think I should go.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
<s> He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
<s> Well, the studio told me not to.
<s> I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
<s> Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
<s> Think I'll have a glass.
<s> Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
<s> No.
<s> Wherever they're going, I'm going.
<s> Fine!
<s> I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
<s> Your big speech?
<s> Mama, what's...
<s> Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I'll be back.
<s> I'm going out!
<s> I have!
<s> It ain't for lack of trying.
<s> Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
<s> Please sit down...
<s> You didn't say 'Symington says'.
<s> She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
<s> And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
<s> 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
<s> No!
<s> No!
<s> Worse.
<s> How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
<s> There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
<s> Materials. Nothing more.
<s> I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
<s> A brain. Extremities.
<s> What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
<s> Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
<s> Fine.
<s> Elizabeth. My more than sister.
<s> But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
<s> If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
<s> I'm all right. I'm safe,
<s> A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
<s> Aye, Captain.
<s> Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
<s> I resent God's monopoly.
<s> Everything in moderation, Clerval.
<s> Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
<s> And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
<s> Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
<s> Despite the lack of challenge.
<s> Victor, explain yourself.
<s> You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
<s> Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
<s> The strain was evident.
<s> Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
<s> Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
<s> It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
<s> Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
<s> Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
<s> I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Not if they're where I think they are.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> They're off now.
<s> Marcie?
<s> Do you have a dime? A quarter?
<s> Wet. I don't know.
<s> Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
<s> Here we go.
<s> Don't get up. Take a second...
<s> I had to.
<s> I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
<s> God, but I love that sexy talk.
<s> Good call.
<s> I love you.
<s> I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
<s> Lead the way!
<s> Rocky Road.
<s> I got to.
<s> One night on the town.
<s> I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
<s> Another coincidence.
<s> Just my son and I.
<s> Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
<s> Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
<s> Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
<s> So do I just follow you?
<s> I'm exhausted.
<s> He's running the show.
<s> Auto wreck.
<s> No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
<s> Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
<s> Yes, they do.
<s> I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
<s> I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
<s> In the Winnebago.
<s> My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
<s> Kate, Scott?
<s> Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
<s> Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
<s> No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
<s> I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
<s> We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
<s> Yes.
<s> Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
<s> Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
<s> Anytime.
<s> You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
<s> Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
<s> Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
<s> I wasn't scratching!
<s> You can't come in here.
<s> I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
<s> Sight seein'.
<s> How do you know?
<s> This ain't the time.
<s> I did?
<s> Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
<s> It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
<s> That's what you look like.
<s> Where are you right now?
<s> No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
<s> Scarred for life, that's how I am!
<s> He needs our help!
<s> Don't say my name.
<s> -- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
<s> I'm fine, sir.
<s> So I'll get a fair shot?
<s> Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
<s> I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
<s> Sir?  What did he say?
<s> Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
<s> Did you hear?
<s> Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
<s> Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
<s> I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
<s> Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
<s> California.
<s> I'm sure it is.
<s> I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
<s> It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
<s> No, ma'am.
<s> I'll work on it, ma'am.
<s> 'Snot me.  It's him.
<s> Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
<s> Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
<s> I oughtta report you.
<s> Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
<s> Blank faces here, O'Neil.
<s> Is this my glory, sir?
<s> Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
<s> Me?  Why me?
<s> Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
<s> Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
<s> The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
<s> I don't know, I don't care.
<s> "Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
<s> And how do you know that?
<s> You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
<s> When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
<s> That's a good story.
<s> Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
<s> Just askin'
<s> Mighta been civilian.
<s> It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
<s> It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
<s> "Dad."
<s> I think you're the liar.
<s> 15, sir.
<s> Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
<s> Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
<s> Shut your hole, Slutnik.
<s> Darth Vader reads poetry...
<s> Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
<s> You knew about us?
<s> Women.
<s> Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
<s> All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
<s> No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
<s> Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
<s> Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
<s> No.
<s> Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
<s> Nesting?
<s> He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
<s> Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
<s> He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
<s> We? I don't think so.
<s> Oh, I'm not married.
<s> Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
<s> You're fast.
<s> Get your people out of there or I will.
<s> Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
<s> No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
<s> That's right.
<s> We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
<s> You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
<s> We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
<s> Why do you need that?
<s> Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
<s> Good idea.
<s> I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
<s> Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
<s> I'm... I'm shot.
<s> I won't and nothing you say-
<s> Must be some sort of mining facility.
<s> ... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
<s> No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
<s> The guy is terminally selfish!
<s> Oh can't I? Watch me!
<s> Nobody was WATCHING?
<s> He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
<s> It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
<s> Yes Commander?
<s> My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
<s> There is no weather in space.
<s> Never mind, Fred....
<s> You... know us?
<s> The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
<s> Something BAD happened here.
<s> We're doing episode 31, Jason?
<s> We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
<s> Where'd they go? Back inside?
<s> One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
<s> I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
<s> I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
<s> Closer?  I can try.
<s> This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
<s> I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
<s> It's perfectly safe. I promise.
<s> Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
<s> NO, Thank God he has not.
<s> But... Inside, I have seen-
<s> Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
<s> Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
<s> It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
<s> Pedal to the metal...
<s> Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
<s> And a French alliance?
<s> But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
<s> Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
<s> Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
<s> The army can survive without me.
<s> Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
<s> Same old story.
<s> There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
<s> No, my lord.
<s> I'll be twenty next year, sir.
<s> No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
<s> Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
<s> I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
<s> Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
<s> It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
<s> These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
<s> The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
<s> What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
<s> A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
<s> What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
<s> I only meant...
<s> Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
<s> When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
<s> That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
<s> Some things must never change.
<s> Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
<s> We're leaving them?
<s> They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
<s> You know very well who it is that I love.
<s> I'd throw everything away for you.
<s> I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
<s> George, I'm sorry.
<s> Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
<s> Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
<s> Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
<s> This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
<s> They all sound big at the talking stage.
<s> So where's the money?
<s> Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
<s> Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
<s> You're right.
<s> Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
<s> Not too bad.
<s> Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
<s> Yeah, we're getting Martin.
<s> I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
<s> Tell you what...
<s> She can't talk right now.
<s> It's a different kind of deal.
<s> Leo, I don't know.
<s> Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
<s> Look at me, Ray.
<s> Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
<s> Leo spanked a waitress?
<s> Where you been, Harry?
<s> We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
<s> Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
<s> You just did.
<s> I said I had an idea, that's all.
<s> What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
<s> They always paid.
<s> Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
<s> She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
<s> You're kidding, right?
<s> I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
<s> He died.
<s> What Get Away jet?
<s> Martin, look at me.
<s> Wait. How about this?
<s> Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
<s> Compass.
<s> That's not bad. I think you got it down.
<s> I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
<s> I'll find you, Leo...
<s> Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
<s> For any movie.
<s> He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
<s> And you think the movie business is any different?
<s> Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
<s> Oh.
<s> Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
<s> You're as bad as Harry...
<s> You bet.
<s> Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
<s> Don't say a fuckin' word.
<s> You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
<s> I'm thinking about producing.
<s> Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
<s> He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
<s> Be quiet and listen.
<s> No problem. You go on off to bed.
<s> Oh, yeah, sure.
<s> Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
<s> What money?
<s> Hello, Martin.
<s> Really.
<s> Yeah, Karen knows him.
<s> Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
<s> Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
<s> Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
<s> She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
<s> Maureen?
<s> Roger?
<s> Bring it on, dude.
<s> What're you crazy?
<s> Maybe he isn't alone.
<s> You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
<s> It's a risk I'm willing to take.
<s> Sounds reasonable.
<s> Like I always say --
<s> I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
<s> I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
<s> What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
<s> How about you Epps?
<s> And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
<s> We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
<s> Murphy.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about?
<s> Conveniently enough for you.
<s> You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
<s> If money can buy what he wants.
<s> There's a charming thought.
<s> Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
<s> Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
<s> Yeah. Thanks.
<s> You think she's sailing without a crew?
<s> Did you see him?
<s> No cowboy shit. Right.
<s> Same. Any luck?
<s> If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
<s> Hey.
<s> Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
<s> I don't know, are we?
<s> Not our mystery guest again.
<s> I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
<s> Showing you what?
<s> Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
<s> Right here.
<s> If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
<s> I didn't want it to turn out this way.
<s> I think I see it pretty well.
<s> We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
<s> Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
<s> Leave it.
<s> Better late than never.
<s> You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
<s> Who?
<s> Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
<s> I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
<s> It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
<s> I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
<s> Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
<s> But I was only trying to be friendly...
<s> Oh my God, that's HIM!
<s> Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
<s> Yeah, well... hi...
<s> Can I come in?
<s> Why?
<s> Because if you do, I'll kill you!
<s> Forget it...
<s> I know, she needs to die immediately.
<s> Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
<s> Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
<s> God, it's so totally pathetic.
<s> I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Totally! Look!
<s> Ew, it's like some gross rat...
<s> Forget it, I can't explain it...
<s> Somewhere downtown.
<s> What, is she black now?
<s> You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
<s> Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
<s> Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
<s> God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
<s> ...maybe we should be lesbos...
<s> I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
<s> Don't worry.
<s> I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
<s> No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
<s> You're insane.
<s> What are you talking about? Who?
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> I said "great"...
<s> I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
<s> What time?
<s> Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
<s> Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
<s> I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
<s> Shhh!
<s> Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
<s> A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
<s> Seymour does.
<s> It's kind of falling apart.
<s> I know it's over, asshole, I --
<s> Get a job!
<s> God, fuck you!
<s> Indian records?
<s> Wow!
<s> Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
<s> Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
<s> Oh, right...
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
<s> Shh!
<s> These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
<s> It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
<s> Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
<s> It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
<s> What? You're kidding me...
<s> What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
<s> What, are you trying to get rid of me?
<s> I had to see you.
<s> Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
<s> What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
<s> At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
<s> What?
<s> I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
<s> But, I...
<s> I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
<s> Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
<s> I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
<s> She's not at home?
<s> What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
<s> Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
<s> Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
<s> Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
<s> On that pathetic fake blind date.
<s> So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
<s> Why don't we start with that next week?
<s> As are they all.
<s> My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
<s> Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
<s> You never had it.
<s> I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
<s> I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
<s> The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
<s> Have you got that in writing? 
<s> So that's what a lion looks like. 
<s> Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
<s> You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
<s> But you said they were always old.
<s> -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
<s> Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
<s> No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
<s> But of course yours worked.
<s> What happened to them?
<s> Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
<s> You think they'll come then?  Why?
<s> Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
<s> Once... 
<s> Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
<s> I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
<s> No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
<s> I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
<s> There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
<s> Okay, let's take a look.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
<s> No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
<s> Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
<s> Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
<s> So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
<s> Okay.
<s> I know.
<s> I await the word of Vigo.
<s> Maybe they just want to appeal.
<s> Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
<s> Get on with it, counselor!
<s> I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
<s> Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
<s> A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
<s> Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
<s> I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
<s> It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
<s> I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
<s> And it's all flowing toward the museum.
<s> I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
<s> Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
<s> Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
<s> Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
<s> If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
<s> It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
<s> No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
<s> This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
<s> We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
<s> Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
<s> Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
<s> Huh?  What?
<s> No, I just thought --
<s> No.  They're just coming to me.
<s> Eight o'clock?
<s> No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
<s> I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
<s> So what do you think it was?
<s> What?
<s> This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
<s> Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
<s> "Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
<s> I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
<s> Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
<s> I want you inside me.
<s> I am Zuul.  I am ...
<s> Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
<s> Talk to my accountant. 
<s> Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
<s> We'll get back to you.
<s> Print is dead.
<s> Yes, it would.
<s> No, you may not.
<s> Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
<s> A square?
<s> Two wavy lines?
<s> I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
<s> They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
<s> I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
<s> The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
<s> What have you got, Egon?
<s> Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
<s> What do you mean "bad?"
<s> What is it?
<s> Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
<s> Full-stream with strogon pulse.
<s> God, it's ugly!
<s> Neutronize.  System shut.
<s> That appears to be the case.
<s> Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
<s> What do we do now?
<s> My parents left me that house, I was born there.
<s> This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
<s> Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
<s> It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
<s> I don't think it's Shandor.
<s> What?  What popped in there?
<s> Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
<s> Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
<s> If I may be so bold...
<s> If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
<s> Yes?  Go on!
<s> That's difficult to say, general.
<s> At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
<s> I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
<s> That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
<s> That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
<s> You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
<s> But have never been?
<s> They can't... if this is Rome...
<s> You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
<s> Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
<s> On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
<s> Well, we can try...
<s> Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
<s> I can't let you do that.
<s> The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
<s> Isn't the helmet magnificent?
<s> I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
<s> Alive... I'm alive...
<s> Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
<s> A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
<s> I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
<s> I want nothing to do with the arena.
<s> No.
<s> This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
<s> No, I couldn't.
<s> Yes.
<s> During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
<s> Get out of here.
<s> Here he comes.
<s> Because -- I am.
<s> All right then! Yes!
<s> You've got to tell me what she said.
<s> Then what?
<s> If you want.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
<s> Shhhh.
<s> Mr. McQuire.
<s> There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
<s> Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
<s> All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
<s> You heard me. Out of here.
<s> Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
<s> What? No. Nothing.
<s> It's down the hall.
<s> No.
<s> Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
<s> What?
<s> So?
<s> Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
<s> Will you unzip my dress?
<s> Oh. Well, goodnight.
<s> Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
<s> What if he did?
<s> I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Oh. Hello. Hello.
<s> Very well. Thank you.
<s> A drink? Of course.
<s> Well -- I don't know.
<s> That's fine.
<s> Well -- do you want to go up first?
<s> Isn't there something you want to tell me?
<s> Yes.
<s> Either one will be fine.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> This is all terribly wrong.
<s> Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
<s> Well what do you want to talk about?
<s> Well?
<s> How about art.
<s> You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> What novel did you read.
<s> Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
<s> Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
<s> On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
<s> Is it?
<s> Think real hard, Benjamin.
<s> Why are you asking me all this?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> It was a Ford, Benjamin.
<s> Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
<s> I was just kidding around.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> Are you?
<s> But if it's sickening for you --
<s> Then give me your word you won't.
<s> Yes, but I'm afraid --
<s> I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
<s> When I go off?
<s> Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
<s> Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
<s> What about it?
<s> No.
<s> I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
<s> No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
<s> Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
<s> That's a hell of a good age to be.
<s> I'd like to hear it.
<s> I will.
<s> What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
<s> Why?
<s> It's Benjamin.
<s> I'd like to discuss this.
<s> Dad -- can you listen --
<s> They are?  Come on.
<s> No.
<s> Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
<s> Why?
<s> You can't.
<s> What about the money?
<s> Who?
<s> Oh -- work!!
<s> Money -- Ever heard of it?
<s> Free --
<s> Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
<s> Where downstairs?
<s> Of course.
<s> Chasing what?
<s> I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
<s> Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
<s> For tonight. 
<s> I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
<s> No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
<s> So alone.
<s> You mustn't talk Russian to me.
<s> That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
<s> I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
<s> Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
<s> Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
<s> I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
<s> Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
<s> Don't.
<s> Not at all, sir. 
<s> I'm Baron von Gaigern.
<s> Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
<s> General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
<s> No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
<s> Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
<s> We could come to my room.
<s> Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
<s> I thought she was splendid!
<s> No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
<s> Don't do that. 
<s> No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
<s> No -- letters to two-eighty.
<s> Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
<s> No, Doctor.
<s> Nobody, Doctor.
<s> Send his bags up to my room.
<s> For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
<s> Everything?
<s> Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
<s> You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
<s> Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
<s> She's beautiful -- isn't she?
<s> Yes.
<s> Money!
<s> What?
<s> Moreover --
<s> You pay me.
<s> I got ten marks for that.
<s> Me.
<s> Moreover...
<s> Can't you understand me?
<s> Well?
<s> Why not?
<s> Exactly.
<s> Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
<s> What a session this has been.
<s> In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
<s> The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
<s> Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
<s> Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
<s> But when did he go? How do you know?
<s> Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
<s> The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
<s> Have I kept you waiting?
<s> Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
<s> Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
<s> I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
<s> It'll never happen again. I swear.
<s> I'll loan you a raincoat.
<s> And if you do it wrong?
<s> What's that, Lilly?
<s> On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
<s> Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
<s> No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
<s> Can't move.
<s> And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
<s> We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
<s> What? He's going to be all right!
<s> You know who I work for.
<s> My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
<s> I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
<s> That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
<s> I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
<s> That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
<s> Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
<s> Fair enough.
<s> Only one tooth?
<s> Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
<s> That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
<s> Bluebell came in?
<s> Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
<s> As though you do what I say.
<s> Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
<s> Oh? I didn't know anything was.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I don't see why not.
<s> ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
<s> I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
<s> I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
<s> Scram. Go home.
<s> In your other hand.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Mm?
<s> You called the doctor, huh?
<s> Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
<s> Every day in every way.
<s> Because it's comfortable.
<s> We'll rent a car.
<s> See you soon.
<s> Upstate where?
<s> Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
<s> I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
<s> Sure.
<s> What?
<s> Bullshit!
<s> Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
<s> Only the real stiffs.
<s> It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
<s> Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
<s> Do I know you?
<s> Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
<s> Would somebody shut this guy up?
<s> My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
<s> Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
<s> Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
<s> I was trying to protect you from this...
<s> Just get on the bus.
<s> John, you can't help her now.
<s> What?
<s> I did alright.
<s> You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
<s> I thought you were allergic to latex.
<s> You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
<s> Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
<s> But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
<s> Then they can watch.
<s> The voice man!  He's here!
<s> But I've seen him!
<s> Jamie?  But I thought she was --
<s> But surely Rogers isn't --
<s> You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
<s> You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
<s> This is madness, Wynn.
<s> Samhain.
<s> Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
<s> No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
<s> No!!!
<s> It's a bitch.
<s> I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
<s> It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
<s> Tell them yourself!
<s> Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
<s> Go home!
<s> I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
<s> First Nagasaki--now this.
<s> She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
<s> Really?
<s> Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
<s> When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
<s> The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
<s> You've come to the right man.
<s> Our pleasure.
<s> It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
<s> You're making a joke.
<s> What?
<s> Thank God!
<s> Are you--do you--
<s> She met him at college.
<s> Mhravitch.
<s> They're not engaged.
<s> Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
<s> She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
<s> Can't it keep till morning?
<s> Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
<s> Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
<s> No.
<s> You are woman.  I know woman well.
<s> Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
<s> Turn around?
<s> Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
<s> They don't have to feel like slaves.
<s> This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
<s> Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
<s> The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
<s> I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> It's a big and busy funeral home.
<s> It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
<s> Almost a Christmas scene.
<s> Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
<s> It's always locked.
<s> I've literally got to run!
<s> What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
<s> Are you've seen it work cures?
<s> You were wrong, you quack!
<s> Lest we forget how cruel you are.
<s> It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
<s> You haven't heard me yet.
<s> Now who's being cruel?
<s> You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
<s> Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
<s> Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
<s> My violin is avenged!
<s> But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
<s> Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
<s> New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
<s> She did?
<s> So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
<s> For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
<s> My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
<s> Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
<s> Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
<s> A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
<s> No.
<s> That man is your father.
<s> It is you, isn't it, Harold?
<s> Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
<s> You're taking Mom out tonight?
<s> He is my father.
<s> Doing what?
<s> How nice.
<s> How long has this been going on?
<s> I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
<s> Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
<s> What?
<s> Tonight's the night.
<s> I'm amazed.
<s> He's not your son.
<s> We met here earlier this evening.
<s> Not true.
<s> Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
<s> Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
<s> There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> You may do that in the privacy of your room.
<s> I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
<s> Sam?
<s> Yeah. How did you know?
<s> She thinks so.  What do you do?
<s> Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
<s> Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know her?
<s> Do you know where she lives?
<s> Last I heard he went to San Diego.
<s> I don't drink, but you can go out.
<s> No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
<s> You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
<s> No.
<s> Not very.
<s> It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
<s> If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
<s> What makes you so sure?
<s> So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
<s> Well, what do they know?
<s> So then, Mr. Mast...
<s> That's right.
<s> No.
<s> They are?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Who made it?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Do you think she's safe?
<s> Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
<s> Get out!
<s> Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
<s> I just heard. Who is he?
<s> It's just a name.
<s> Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
<s> No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
<s> They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
<s> What will I tell the others? They care about you.
<s> I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
<s> Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
<s> Is this with a girl named Kristen?
<s> Good.
<s> You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
<s> No.
<s> My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
<s> Film making can be pretty expensive...
<s> Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
<s> Who's that?
<s> You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
<s> 'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Oh, I don't have one.
<s> I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
<s> All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
<s> Hello.
<s> None of that, lady.
<s> You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
<s> Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
<s> No, thank you. I have my car.
<s> What?
<s> Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
<s> Thank you, but I really have to go.
<s> That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know. Just one of those. 
<s> Over there by the courthouse.
<s> What is that he's working on?
<s> Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
<s> Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
<s> It's all right.  It's organic.
<s> Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
<s> I like you, Maude.
<s> Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
<s> Where's that?
<s> Really. Just put it there, Harold.
<s> Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
<s> Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
<s> Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
<s> Yes. They're old friends.
<s> We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
<s> Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
<s> But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
<s> Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
<s> I don't care what people say.
<s> Can't complain.
<s> Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
<s> Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
<s> I wouldn't say "benefit."
<s> What about the draft?
<s> No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
<s> I go to funerals.
<s> Well, maybe one.
<s> Yes.
<s> I burnt down the Chemistry building.
<s> Jeez! That's a great story,
<s> I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
<s> To pit your own life against another.
<s> Oh sure.
<s> Well, I don't...
<s> Souvenirs?
<s> Eh, yes, ma'm.
<s> Oh yes. That's fine.
<s> Oh, yes. How did you like that?
<s> Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
<s> Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
<s> Julia.
<s> Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
<s> Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
<s> God, that's terrible.
<s> So you slept O.K.?
<s> WHY?
<s> And what about you?
<s> The Cenobites.
<s> No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
<s> I'm lucky that way.
<s> I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
<s> Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
<s> That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
<s> Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
<s> 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
<s> Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
<s> Noooo! Noooo!!!
<s> Anung-un-Rama...
<s> Those things never work. Never.
<s> My job.
<s> Father's back?  Still angry?
<s> No one ever helps me. It's my job.
<s> Start in, you got nachos coming.
<s> Marco...
<s> Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
<s> -- Late. Five minutes late.
<s> -- Section fifty-one. Step back.
<s> Two steps back, please.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Sure.
<s> Julia's my second wife.
<s> I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
<s> No. That wasn't the deal.
<s> Stay the fuck away from me.
<s> No.
<s> This isn't happening.
<s> Poor baby.
<s> That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
<s> I don't want to see the dress.
<s> I'm very happy.
<s> And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
<s> Yes. They'll never find us.
<s> There's very little I can do about it.
<s> The best part of ten years.
<s> You mean we're moving in?
<s> I hear you.
<s> Shit.
<s> Sure.
<s> Please...
<s> Not much.
<s> That depends.
<s> Try me.
<s> Steve.
<s> I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
<s> You will keep in touch.
<s> Is Julia here?
<s> Sure.
<s> I've forgotten.
<s> Sure.
<s> Finished?
<s> Yes!
<s> We walk.
<s> Your father told me you were working here.
<s> What things?
<s> Will you GO, damn you?
<s> That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
<s> I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
<s> I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
<s> Ehh.
<s> To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
<s> No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
<s> But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
<s> Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
<s> Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
<s> What the fuck is that?
<s> You're not even coming?
<s> So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
<s> Laura.  Her dad died.
<s> Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
<s> Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
<s> No, you can't.
<s> Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
<s> No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
<s> We work there!
<s> Why?
<s> Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
<s> Oh, hi.
<s> Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
<s> So.  Is now a good time?
<s> Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
<s> Uh...yes, at the moment.
<s> Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
<s> Well, I'll just make it for you.
<s> Can I help you?
<s> Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
<s> Fine.
<s> Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
<s> I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
<s> We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
<s> -- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
<s> And do you like it that way?
<s> I think you know that.
<s> Good.  So.  Is it my job?
<s> I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
<s> Fine.  One.
<s> I haven't felt like it.
<s> No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
<s> You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
<s> You still together?  Going all right?
<s> I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
<s> Hi.
<s> Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
<s> I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
<s> Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
<s> But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
<s> And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
<s> No use.
<s> Hi.  What are you doing?
<s> I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
<s> And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
<s> That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
<s> I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
<s> Would you marry me if I was?
<s> Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
<s> Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
<s> God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
<s> Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
<s> Yes.  You?
<s> Yeah.
<s> God, you ask a lot of questions.
<s> And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
<s> Then what are you getting so upset about?
<s> It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
<s> Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
<s> That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
<s> Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
<s> And I won't take a penny over ninety.
<s> Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
<s> Records are those big round black things, right?
<s> Maybe he's hiding from something.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure.
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
<s> Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
<s> You're a fool.
<s> Yes.
<s> A factor of age.
<s> He knows about you.
<s> I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
<s> Now there's a new topic.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You and I should talk first.
<s> I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
<s> I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
<s> No!
<s> We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> Muy Bien!
<s> If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
<s> Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
<s> That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
<s> So sure?
<s> They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
<s> Not likely.
<s> Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
<s> Must he go?
<s> Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
<s> I don't know.
<s> And the Bulgarian?
<s> Head still secure to the neck.
<s> Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
<s> -Since you last saw me.
<s> How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
<s> I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
<s> Should I care?
<s> American.
<s> What are you getting at?
<s> A mystery.
<s> A neighbor saw your car leave.
<s> Do you?
<s> I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
<s> The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
<s> His only kid.
<s> Just your pappy scared some.
<s> It doesn't have to rhyme!
<s> Au revoir, mon capitaine.
<s> Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
<s> My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
<s> It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
<s> That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
<s> He certainly -- hic -- does!
<s> And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
<s> Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
<s> You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
<s> 
<s> Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
<s> Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
<s> Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
<s> Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
<s> Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
<s> And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
<s> Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
<s> What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
<s> Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
<s> Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
<s> She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
<s> The money? Why?
<s> Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
<s> Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
<s> I notice you still remember it.
<s> You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
<s> Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
<s> Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
<s> What?!!
<s> I have a lunch date. I just want --
<s> Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
<s> Just what I said. That's what I --
<s> Listen, Walter --
<s> Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
<s> I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
<s> Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
<s> I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
<s> Say, could I meet him?
<s> I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
<s> Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
<s> Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
<s> That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
<s> Where's Butch?
<s> Where's Bruce?
<s> Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
<s> Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
<s> Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
<s> When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
<s> Murder, uh?
<s> Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
<s> Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
<s> Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
<s> Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
<s> You -- you!!
<s> You know you did!
<s> A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
<s> Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
<s> Three bullets! Any good?
<s> Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
<s> Give me a hand with her, will you?
<s> Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
<s> Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
<s> Three sixes. Is that any good?
<s> Good coffee, isn't it?
<s> I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
<s> This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
<s> You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
<s> That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
<s> Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
<s> And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
<s> We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
<s> They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
<s> How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
<s> I never saw him before!
<s> I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
<s> I can't.
<s> Editorials?
<s> My name is Louis Peluso.
<s> Phone for you, Hildy.
<s> Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
<s> But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
<s> I thought so, too.
<s> Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
<s> Huh?
<s> From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
<s> Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
<s> That man there!
<s> Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
<s> Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
<s> Wait a minute, Mollie.
<s> Quiet, Mollie!
<s> I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
<s> Never mind! Just play dead.
<s> Forty dollars.
<s> All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
<s> I'll explain it tomorrow!
<s> You're insane!
<s> Hello, Mollie.
<s> We want to see you.
<s> Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
<s> Why?
<s> I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
<s> Yes, you was. Make him talk.
<s> I only know one.
<s> Bugger off, you bloody sod.
<s> Pauline.
<s> It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
<s> Well, for the baby, really.
<s> I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
<s> Propaganda. We've been had.
<s> Naturally.
<s> There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
<s> And I'm still just a lad myself.
<s> Fair enough.  The river.
<s> There, there, my baby.
<s> Grace!
<s> ...since I used to take you to the Proms?
<s> You might still have a house.
<s> Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
<s> You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
<s> I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
<s> Cool.
<s> Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
<s> No, I told you...
<s> If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
<s> Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
<s> Nice.
<s> Are you two gals all funny with each other?
<s> I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
<s> Yeah, I'll do something.
<s> Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
<s> Hey, wait take this.
<s> Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
<s> I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
<s> How awesome?
<s> What's that?
<s> Way out here?
<s> Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
<s> Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Here he comes.
<s> He won't move.
<s> Turn that fucking radio off!
<s> Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
<s> It won't work.
<s> Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
<s> Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
<s> He should be back in a couple hours.
<s> What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
<s> I don't want to see that.
<s> Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
<s> It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
<s> These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
<s> I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
<s> That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
<s> Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
<s> Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
<s> I can't believe...
<s> Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
<s> A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
<s> What do they call you, sweety?
<s> Great.
<s> Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
<s> Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
<s> This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
<s> Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
<s> Who's your Daddy!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
<s> Woof.
<s> Yes. Happy happy.
<s> Not in front of the boy.
<s> You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
<s> I don't know.
<s> We still have you and I.
<s> Okay, my sweet. Good night.
<s> Very well.
<s> I want to be the way I was before.
<s> I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
<s> Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
<s> Oh, Rosie.
<s> With pleasure.
<s> Oh, Rosie.
<s> Shut up, you.
<s> I'm really glad you two found each other.
<s> They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
<s> I'm sorry that I became so upset.
<s> It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
<s> That's a great idea.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> What?
<s> All right.
<s> Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
<s> Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
<s> I guess.
<s> That was wonderful!
<s> Oh boy!
<s> Ummm. It's good.
<s> Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
<s> Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
<s> It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
<s> Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
<s> I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
<s> Check!
<s> I've never been to Louisville.
<s> That's right, Miss Packard.
<s> Do we need words?
<s> It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
<s> The night is two thousand dollars old.
<s> Cash.
<s> Yeah. Sure, sure.
<s> How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
<s> I told you. I got drunk.
<s> To do what?
<s> You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
<s> You know everybody, don't you?
<s> Where do I sign?
<s> You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
<s> I been thinking.
<s> No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
<s> Come on, let's go...
<s> Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
<s> Well, I win sometimes.
<s> All right. Five hundred.
<s> No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
<s> No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
<s> What's your game? What do you shoot?
<s> Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
<s> I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
<s> Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
<s> Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
<s> Approximately? One thousand bucks.
<s> Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
<s> If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
<s> I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
<s> Glad to meet you.
<s> Hi.
<s> Okay, friend.
<s> Call it.
<s> Fair.
<s> How come you didn't catch your bus?
<s> I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
<s> I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
<s> No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
<s> You told me.
<s> Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
<s> The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
<s> It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
<s> What's it so hot in here for?
<s> What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
<s> Is he a winner?
<s> I love you.
<s> Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
<s> Come here. Come on, now.
<s> Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
<s> Nine ball.  Three ball.
<s> You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
<s> My name is Robert.
<s> Yes.
<s> Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
<s> I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
<s> This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
<s> This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
<s> That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
<s> Sure ... fine.
<s> He was upset with moving, I believe.
<s> May I ask why?
<s> I'd believe him.
<s> Behind my house, up on the ridge.
<s> Hide the car.
<s> I know a way.
<s> Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
<s> No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
<s> What? -- I... 
<s> All right.  I'll be right back.
<s> If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
<s> Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
<s> Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
<s> He's not going to listen to me.
<s> He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
<s> What's the bad news?
<s> ...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
<s> College nickname.
<s> What'd I say?
<s> Great.
<s> I can't shake her free.
<s> I had a feeling you would.
<s> But Mr. President...
<s> And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
<s> We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
<s> Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
<s> No Sir. Definitely not.
<s> Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
<s> Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
<s> I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
<s> Jimmy, stay with me.
<s> We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
<s> Here... now.
<s> Peace? No peace.
<s> There is no museum in Iskenderun.
<s> The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
<s> It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
<s> Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
<s> Where?
<s> Arghhh! Oh!
<s> I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
<s> Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
<s> Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
<s> I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
<s> My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
<s> Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
<s> What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
<s> I usually don't.
<s> You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
<s> Don't know. Think of something.
<s> Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
<s> I came to get you! What do you think?
<s> Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
<s> No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
<s> Look, can we discuss this later?
<s> Will you take it easy!
<s> Don't worry. He won't.
<s> So did I.
<s> You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
<s> Try and burn through the ropes.
<s> I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
<s> I was the next man.
<s> Hmmm... What did we talk about?
<s> Fly... yes. Land... no.
<s> More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I know, Dad!
<s> After you, Junior.
<s> Who are you?
<s> Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
<s> If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
<s> If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
<s> I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
<s> I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
<s> No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
<s> It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
<s> Something magical. A sacred rock.
<s> Miss Scott panicked?
<s> I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
<s> Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
<s> A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
<s> Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
<s> Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
<s> Lao She.
<s> Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
<s> Read you loud and clear, Indy!
<s> Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
<s> Two are still missing.
<s> Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
<s> You're betrayed Shiva. 
<s> I don't understand. What's happened here?
<s> They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
<s> Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
<s> A SNAKE!!
<s> What?!
<s> THE WHAT?!
<s> I know the feeling...
<s> Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
<s> Just try and control yourself.
<s> Maybe he likes older women.
<s> I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
<s> What -- the bug?
<s> You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
<s> I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
<s> Willie!
<s> Yes.
<s> What above the curves?!
<s> Not quite.
<s> And they don't even know what it really is.
<s> They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
<s> I know you did!
<s> What street?
<s> ...I need to make a phone call.
<s> Hear voices don't I.
<s> Then I'm crazy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
<s> How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
<s> Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
<s> Go out, take your first left.
<s> Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
<s> Who did?
<s> They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
<s> Don't know.
<s> You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
<s> I'm at the airport.
<s> Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
<s> We'll change your appearance.
<s> Little late for that.
<s> Where are you going? Wait!
<s> What was?
<s> Follow it.
<s> What can I do? You're on your own.
<s> What?
<s> Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
<s> Rene...
<s> Well you did it today.
<s> Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
<s> Why not?!
<s> I don't know!
<s> It's not your time. I get time off.
<s> That's good. It's not better. Where?
<s> Just stay here and rest.
<s> It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
<s> You have to! Quickly!
<s> Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
<s> I can't see a thing.
<s> You were with GRUNER!
<s> Come on.
<s> Just say the words. Just like I told you.
<s> While he makes the run.
<s> And don't let her know, either.
<s> What exactly?
<s> I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
<s> What a nerve!
<s> Who's our little man?
<s> Then how did you know?
<s> We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
<s> It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
<s> I have a new client.
<s> I think I've heard of you.
<s> Do what?
<s> Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
<s> Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
<s> I said...I didn't say..anything!
<s> Without what?
<s> ...Rene.
<s> Disinterest?
<s> You talk to yourself.
<s> You're talking to me.
<s> ...Naw. Made that up.
<s> Hires you for what?
<s> Why'd you run off?
<s> They left. I had to go with them.
<s> Wanted to get to know you.
<s> You seemed interesting.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
<s> Last night?
<s> This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
<s> What'd he steal?
<s> Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
<s> They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
<s> Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
<s> It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
<s> We figure out if it's in here.
<s> Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
<s> You can say that again. What do we do?
<s> What?
<s> I love you too.
<s> Do something!
<s> That's twenty feet high.
<s> ...Piece of mind.
<s> Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
<s> Why'd you invite me here?
<s> A drink...
<s> Ahhh...Okay?!!!
<s> Thank you.
<s> So we better get started.
<s> Okay.
<s> She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
<s> You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
<s> I'll be there.
<s> Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
<s> Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
<s> Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
<s> I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
<s> No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
<s> No, I'm not...
<s> Yes, I'm afraid I did.
<s> Hey, Lowell.
<s> No, no, we're fine...
<s> How grave?
<s> I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
<s> I'm doing an interview.
<s> Did you say Berman?
<s> It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
<s> I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
<s> ..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
<s> Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
<s> These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
<s> What?
<s> No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
<s> Black, black...
<s> Far as you go where?
<s> If you want to do it.
<s> To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
<s> They're afraid of you, aren't they?
<s> Like what?
<s> The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
<s> Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
<s> Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
<s> They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
<s> ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
<s> What?!
<s> No.
<s> What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
<s> She sued you for back payments of child support?
<s> What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
<s> A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
<s> You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
<s> What?
<s> You called me.
<s> Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
<s> The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
<s> Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
<s> When should we do this?
<s> Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
<s> Well, I wouldn't say --
<s> They hate each other --
<s> Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
<s> You did good, Massey!
<s> She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
<s> Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
<s> I just want to make sure that you both --
<s> Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
<s> Got any symptoms?
<s> Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
<s> Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
<s> You have the pre-nup?
<s> I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
<s> Why do you think she did it?
<s> Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
<s> It's about time.
<s> I said yes.
<s> Did you see the tape?
<s> Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
<s> You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Your mother was.
<s> That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
<s> No.
<s> I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
<s> I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
<s> Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
<s> Fabric and fringe.
<s> Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
<s> The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
<s> Meaning my house.
<s> So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
<s> Hello Miles.
<s> It's not something I wanted either.
<s> Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
<s> Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
<s> Sometimes I forget.
<s> Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
<s> Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
<s> I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
<s> In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
<s> Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
<s> Well what does he want?
<s> Oh, God!
<s> Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
<s> Heh heh.
<s> Oh brother. Here we go.
<s> We've outlined a settlement...
<s> No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
<s> Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> She brought my digestive enzymes.
<s> Video.
<s> I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
<s> Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
<s> She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
<s> Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
<s> What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
<s> That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?
<s> If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
<s> She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
<s> I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
<s> Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
<s> If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
<s> South America.
<s> I'll get it annulled.
<s> Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
<s> Oh, yes. I heard.
<s> Oh, no.
<s> On the road.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
<s> Is that his name?
<s> She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
<s> Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> I haven't the slightest idea.
<s> Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
<s> Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
<s> Yes.
<s> I didn't ask for your advice. 
<s> Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
<s> Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
<s> Beat it! 
<s> That's none of your business.
<s> I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
<s> Hurry up and get dressed.
<s> Um. You're doing all right.
<s> Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
<s> Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
<s> How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
<s> You always want to run everything.
<s> Why, haven't you?
<s> Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
<s> Oh, Peter 
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Never!  I'm going in and ask him
<s> A black eye. 
<s> Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
<s> I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
<s> Whome?  Want to see me?
<s> Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
<s> When does the bus leave?
<s> Thank you.
<s> If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
<s> Yes.
<s> To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, I'll be
<s> ain't got a hat
<s> I ain't got a hat.
<s> Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
<s> I dunno.
<s> Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
<s> Yeah, you'll have to git .
<s> Hey, you!
<s> I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
<s> Yeah. Come oncome on!
<s> Why?
<s> No.
<s> Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
<s> Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
<s> You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
<s> You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
<s> Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
<s> Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
<s> Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
<s> You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
<s> Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
<s> Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
<s> No, I'm not...
<s> Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
<s> I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
<s> Keep saying what?
<s> Go on, Willie.
<s> Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
<s> No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
<s> The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
<s> I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
<s> No, I did not.
<s> Calm down, Dave, what?
<s> What did they...
<s> I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
<s> They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
<s> Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
<s> Why Galveston?
<s> And then Sunday?
<s> Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
<s> Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
<s> Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
<s> Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
<s> I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
<s> But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
<s> There were admirals.
<s> If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
<s> There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
<s> How many shots you say you heard?
<s> I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
<s> Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
<s> The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
<s> This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
<s> I know.
<s> Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
<s> You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
<s> I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
<s> Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
<s> Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
<s> I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
<s> You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
<s> Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
<s> We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
<s> I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
<s> Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
<s> The Warren Commission call him?
<s> If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
<s> Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
<s> Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
<s> Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
<s> I don't know if I should talk about this.
<s> I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
<s> And Oswald?
<s> Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
<s> It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
<s> Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
<s> Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
<s> Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
<s> The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, that's not a problem.
<s> I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
<s> I know. That's why I went.
<s> I'll call her.
<s> That's not what they're tellin' me.
<s> I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
<s> Let me finish. Can I finish?
<s> In his inside coat pocket.
<s> She wants to make a deal.
<s> She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
<s> Arrest me.
<s> 'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
<s> Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
<s> We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
<s> Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
<s> I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
<s> What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
<s> Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
<s> He called you?
<s> Sandra Bullock. You know her?
<s> I'm old enough to be her father.
<s> They seem to like the idea.
<s> Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
<s> He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
<s> Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
<s> When did you decide?
<s> The day you got me out of jail?
<s> Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
<s> And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
<s> He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
<s> More or less.
<s> I believe I said I'd be tempted.
<s> It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
<s> You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
<s> Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
<s> All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
<s> We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
<s> I'm sure.
<s> What's he doing?
<s> Did you tell him you were leaving?
<s> I didn't say you did.
<s> Spain.
<s> I'm just tired in general.
<s> Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
<s> And cooperate? You might get probation.
<s> You know what's in the bag you're taking?
<s> Yeah?
<s> What the fuck is that shit?
<s> It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
<s> You never asked me if I did or not.
<s> A Broadway shopping bag.
<s> Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
<s> Who's the other one?
<s> But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
<s> I never have. It's not my money.
<s> What? To put one of these in my pocket?
<s> After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
<s> I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
<s> I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
<s> This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
<s> I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
<s> Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
<s> That coke was yours, wasn't it?
<s> You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
<s> Do you got something for me?
<s> Got some o.j.?
<s> They asked.
<s> I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
<s> The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
<s> I said, you understand what I'm saying
<s> A woman.
<s> I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
<s> Managers get ten percent.
<s> What the hell you talkin' bout?
<s> If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
<s> I can sit through it once.
<s> Yeah, there's another hit left.
<s> No thanks.
<s> I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
<s> No.
<s> You lived in Japan, when?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
<s> Which one is for the car?
<s> I dunno.
<s> I'm in my underwear.
<s> Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
<s> Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
<s> Twice. In the parking lot.
<s> Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
<s> You said five hundred and fifty!
<s> We went to the parking lot.
<s> Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
<s> Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
<s> You have cash. What do you need me for?
<s> You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
<s> Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
<s> I got some more business for ya.
<s> What?
<s> Hear what?
<s> What does she do for you?
<s> Is that what I think it is?
<s> She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
<s> Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
<s> And where's Jackie?
<s> That I gotta see.
<s> Call her, tell her the combination.
<s> I know where it is.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No problem.
<s> Let me speak to Max Cherry.
<s> He leave town?
<s> Give me his home number.
<s> There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
<s> Oh God!
<s> I could have told you that.
<s> It's short, huh?
<s> Just my luck.
<s> But the paper ...
<s> Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
<s> What can I tell you?
<s> Her knee acting up?
<s> Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
<s> Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
<s> I haven't seen her in months.
<s> I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
<s> Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
<s> I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
<s> I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
<s> Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
<s> Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
<s> Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
<s> I thought you said it was a nightmare?
<s> They're weird names.
<s> That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
<s> Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
<s> Why do you bring her up?
<s> What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
<s> Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
<s> They weren't human!
<s> Where are we?
<s> I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
<s> Get your clothes off!
<s> Coming here?
<s> Here. I'll do it.
<s> In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
<s> Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
<s> Stick with me, kid.
<s> I promise.
<s> Sit down.
<s> It's over, Jake. It's all over.
<s> Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<s> Mid-town mostly.
<s> West.
<s> Sit down, Jake.
<s> Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
<s> Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<s> What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
<s> How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
<s> Like it was yesterday.
<s> If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
<s> One drop?
<s> Just relax.
<s> They're awfully heavy.
<s> If you're lucky.
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> Call my chiropractor.
<s> Last night! They were as real as you are!
<s> I need to see you.
<s> No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
<s> Why the hell we drivin' here?
<s> Who is?
<s> Oh God. I know. I know.
<s> Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
<s> How did it happen?
<s> No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
<s> He doesn't like it.
<s> He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
<s> Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
<s> He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
<s> Delongpre! Out of time!
<s> Sergeant? We thought you were...
<s> He came for me, I had to run!
<s> I'm coming, I'm coming.
<s> Then stop talking and work faster!
<s> Suit up.
<s> Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
<s> No, you're dead! You're all dead!
<s> Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
<s> Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
<s> Negative.
<s> Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
<s> Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
<s> I hope so.
<s> 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
<s> That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
<s> I thought you meant...
<s> Were you close to your father?
<s> Oh sure, all the time.
<s> No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
<s> Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
<s> I get it.
<s> I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
<s> I'm on my way.
<s> GO, GO, GO!
<s> Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
<s> Small brains make your balls itch?
<s> That ought'a help the situation.
<s> So what else is new?
<s> I'm just saying.
<s> Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
<s> Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
<s> Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
<s> We're missing two of the kids!
<s> He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
<s> Keep trying!
<s> Then open the doors!
<s> But?!!
<s> Obviously so.
<s> Nanotechnology.
<s> JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
<s> Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
<s> Old Earth?
<s> Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
<s> On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
<s> What do you mean 'We...?'
<s> All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
<s> ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
<s> We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
<s> Dead astern! Zig-zag!
<s> Full throttle! To port!
<s> 'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
<s> Older, sillier.
<s> I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
<s> Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
<s> Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
<s> I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
<s> Maybe we can save August...
<s> What stinks so bad?
<s> Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
<s> Chum?
<s> It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
<s> That means closing the beaches.
<s> Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
<s> I didn't know her.
<s> Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
<s> Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
<s> I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
<s> He's busy.
<s> Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
<s> We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
<s> I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
<s> Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
<s> 25 feet. And three tons of him there.
<s> Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
<s> And I'll drink to yours.
<s> I think I can top that, Mister...
<s> My mom uses color-safe bleach.
<s> Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
<s> Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
<s> I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
<s> What?
<s> No...
<s> Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
<s> Also, I think I'm in love with you.
<s> No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
<s> Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
<s> Oh, hey Vijay.
<s> I don't really know anything about it.
<s> I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
<s> Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
<s> You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
<s> I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
<s> But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
<s> Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
<s> I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
<s> Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
<s> Oh, go fly a kite.
<s> Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
<s> Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
<s> Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
<s> I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
<s> I wrote that.
<s> That suits you.
<s> I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
<s> Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
<s> Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
<s> Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
<s> Really? Fingernails?
<s> Sure.
<s> Room with a toilet, got it.
<s> So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
<s> What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
<s> Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
<s> I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
<s> Congrats.
<s> No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
<s> Think you can narrow it down for me.
<s> What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
<s> I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
<s> Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
<s> It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
<s> No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
<s> Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
<s> Keith's hot.
<s> Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
<s> Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
<s> You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
<s> Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
<s> Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
<s> I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
<s> No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
<s> Yeah, downtown.
<s> ...Yeah, sure.
<s> I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
<s> That's not true!
<s> Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
<s> Almost.
<s> They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
<s> Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
<s> Early! Stop!!
<s> Not so good. You sure you have to?
<s> Vernon, Florida.
<s> Best kind.
<s> Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
<s> Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
<s> Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
<s> Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
<s> Nah... how much money have you got?
<s> What happened to Adele?
<s> Thank god!
<s> Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
<s> Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
<s> A book on the warehouse murders?
<s> Lighten up...
<s> He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
<s> I heard that.
<s> Look again!
<s> What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
<s> No, never. Excuse me.
<s> Shut your mouth.
<s> Where would we find him?
<s> With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
<s> Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
<s> Yes!
<s> Yeah.
<s> To what? Virgins?
<s> You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
<s> What do you want?
<s> You think he's got any herb?
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
<s> No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
<s> Yeah.
<s> She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
<s> Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
<s> You are?
<s> Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
<s> Nothen' B.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
<s> I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
<s> Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
<s> Yeah. I can understand that.
<s> I like you too.
<s> I don't want you to hurt me.
<s> I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
<s> Bang up stuff.
<s> Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
<s> Do you care about me?
<s> I guess so.
<s> 15.
<s> I tested positive?
<s> Thanks.
<s> I didn't bleed.
<s> Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
<s> Yep.
<s> Because he can like climax you up to that...
<s> Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
<s> It's really slow. It's slow boring.
<s> And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
<s> Yeah.
<s> You think so?
<s> When are you gonna be back?
<s> Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
<s> Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
<s> Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
<s> It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
<s> You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
<s> How'd you get in here?
<s> What do you want?
<s> I was at the beach.
<s> He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
<s> Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
<s> Find him!  I want to talk to him.
<s> What was suspicious about him?
<s> But a hundred men could move him.
<s> He was with me?
<s> Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
<s> Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
<s> Did you know her?
<s> We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
<s> If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
<s> Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
<s> I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
<s> You sonofabitch!
<s> Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
<s> No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
<s> Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
<s> I just can't believe it.
<s> How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
<s> He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
<s> That has nothing to do with it.
<s> Okay.
<s> Thanks, David.
<s> I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
<s> Who's Kathy?
<s> Six, eight hours tops.
<s> There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
<s> That's great.
<s> I'd say at least eighteen hours.
<s> But we heard him.
<s> Anything else?
<s> Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
<s> About a quarter to one.
<s> No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
<s> We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
<s> He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
<s> I went out.
<s> He knows you're aware of that.
<s> I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
<s> Mate in five.
<s> Yes.
<s> How can you look at it so clinically?
<s> I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
<s> How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
<s> How could you?  Unless you were there.
<s> I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
<s> Call room service.
<s> For emphasis?
<s> It's not that easy.
<s> Are you going to come tonight?
<s> That's worse.
<s> Well, you're beautiful.
<s> Colwyn.
<s> I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
<s> I won't leave you here.
<s> You have rope?
<s> You won't have to.
<s> Reach out farther. Call to her.
<s> The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
<s> No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
<s> You will tell me her name and we will go together.
<s> The Beast will kill her.
<s> You're coming with us.
<s> I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
<s> Yes.
<s> You and I will guard the fire.
<s> You will follow me.
<s> To the place where Death lives.
<s> Hand over your dinner.
<s> At the gallop!
<s> Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
<s> The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
<s> I cannot go with you, my friend.
<s> And mine goes with you.
<s> I have a cinnamon bar.
<s> I only want one.
<s> First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
<s> Oh, my poor stomach.
<s> Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
<s> Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
<s> With an old voice?
<s> I will seek the Fortress for you.
<s> The Widow of the Web?
<s> That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
<s> Her name is Death.
<s> Fewer will survive them.
<s> It is too late. He has drunk.
<s> Where is he? My son.
<s> Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
<s> No.
<s> Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
<s> OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
<s> ...What?
<s> No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
<s> ...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
<s> Do you need money?
<s> Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
<s> Well, I don't need them...
<s> Good.
<s> Perfect.
<s> OK.
<s> Yes, yes...
<s> OK.
<s> No.
<s> Why?
<s> ...Later.
<s> That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
<s> Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
<s> ...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
<s> Yeah, what?
<s> Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
<s> It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
<s> Huh, that's good!
<s> No...
<s> No it's not.
<s> If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
<s> That's enough.
<s> We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
<s> I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
<s> You do?
<s> No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
<s> I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
<s> There was no card.
<s> Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
<s> Please tell me.
<s> He's plastered.
<s> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
<s> Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
<s> And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
<s> If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
<s> This guy's not a murderer.
<s> Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
<s> You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
<s> Nine.
<s> You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
<s> Mammoth.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
<s> Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
<s> No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
<s> I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
<s> It's mine to risk.
<s> Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
<s> He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
<s> Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
<s> Evening News?
<s> What are my choices?
<s> What do you think I should get?
<s> ...Noooo.
<s> No.
<s> Water?
<s> Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
<s> Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
<s> I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
<s> How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
<s> I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
<s> Is that really what you want to ask me?
<s> Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
<s> Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
<s> There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
<s> Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
<s> Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
<s> Be careful.
<s> Can we just forget it?
<s> Yeah... I'd like that.
<s> And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
<s> I want this, Sera. I need this!
<s> What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
<s> He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
<s> I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
<s> He's an ass that's gonna try.
<s> I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
<s> Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
<s> Who's askin'?
<s> Tell him, Paulette.
<s> He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
<s> You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
<s> For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
<s> Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
<s> That's terrible!
<s> Definitely! I love him!
<s> Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
<s> I'm so happy for you!
<s> Yes, you are.
<s> Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
<s> You guys are so sweet!
<s> You think?
<s> Thank you. I love you, too.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Neat.
<s> I wasn't gonna --
<s> I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
<s> Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
<s> Oh, my God!!
<s> I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
<s> I just don't understand what went wrong --
<s> Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
<s> You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
<s> Your what?
<s> My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
<s> That's why I think it's time for us to --
<s> You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
<s> No.
<s> Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
<s> I gave her my word, Warner.
<s> I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
<s> Where's the Rock?
<s> It's not a Theta --
<s> Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
<s> Yeah, luckily.
<s> Pull up next to him!
<s> Faith.
<s> Then we smash 'em?
<s> Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
<s> Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
<s> You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
<s> To be my bride, of course.
<s> What will become of me then?
<s> From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
<s> Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
<s> Or looked so beautiful...
<s> Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
<s> It's terrible.
<s> I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
<s> We be honored, friend Ogg.
<s> Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
<s> You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
<s> Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
<s> Don't you care about what's happened?
<s> I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
<s> Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
<s> Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
<s> Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
<s> What know you of fields of war?
<s> No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
<s> Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
<s> It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
<s> It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
<s> We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
<s> Fire away!
<s> In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
<s> Sunlight, you say?
<s> I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
<s> Patience, lad.
<s> That's it then... the ring!
<s> These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
<s> Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
<s> They'll do nicely.
<s> Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
<s> I may have said perhaps...
<s> Unicorn?
<s> That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
<s> Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
<s> They rival the angels of paradise.
<s> Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
<s> Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
<s> Only what's right...
<s> Sunlight... It destroys him.
<s> Thought the weather terrible of late.
<s> Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
<s> They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
<s> You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
<s> Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
<s> You'll visit again?
<s> A faerie's love makes anything possible.
<s> And as barren of love as stone.
<s> Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
<s> Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
<s> The Black Baron, you say?
<s> Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
<s> To Castle Couer de Noir?
<s> You follow.
<s> I thought I might stop by.
<s> Since seventh grade.
<s> He's here.  Check the bathroom.
<s> I would have anyway.
<s> I love red!  That's my favorite color!
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I couldn't sleep last night.
<s> He seems lonely.
<s> No.
<s> Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
<s> Nope.
<s> He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
<s> I want you to try something with me, okay?
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't want you to!
<s> I'm not gay.
<s> If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
<s> Floating to Catalina.
<s> If that's what it takes.
<s> What are you on?
<s> Good.  I was hoping for that.
<s> She didn't really say.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Not a shower.
<s> Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
<s> The plumber's due out on Friday.
<s> You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
<s> To check up on me?
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh, okay.
<s> See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
<s> To hide a black eye.
<s> You lied to me!
<s> I can die trying.
<s> A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
<s> Thanks for telling me.
<s> I don't let him.  He just loves to.
<s> Oh.  Sorry.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
<s> At least we'll have a house to show for it.
<s> Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
<s> Well, for later then.
<s> I dreamed about your house last night.
<s> My stupid back.
<s> He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
<s> I smiled at him.
<s> I can hire workers to help me.
<s> No.  Mostly me.
<s> Don't even...I'm there.
<s> I'm thinking it's too weird now.
<s> Who?
<s> I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
<s> What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
<s> So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
<s> I never asked for more.
<s> If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
<s> It's not ours.  It's George's.
<s> Why?
<s> Okay.
<s> This is what he wants.
<s> Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
<s> Why?
<s> I just thought it would be nice.
<s> Someone stop her!
<s> Nagger?
<s> And the baby?
<s> It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
<s> We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
<s> Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
<s> But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
<s> I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
<s> But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
<s> Goodnight, Claude.
<s> He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
<s> Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
<s> That's because I've never been here before.
<s> I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
<s> I don't see where that's any of your business.
<s> I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
<s> That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
<s> Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
<s> There is no Boom-Boom Room.
<s> Oooh...
<s> Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
<s> Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
<s> Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
<s> Yeah, I want some pie.
<s> There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
<s> Here I am.
<s> We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
<s> Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
<s> He does it all by himself.
<s> You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
<s> I said you're soft.
<s> Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
<s> I'm stuck!
<s> The hell you talking about? What train?
<s> I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
<s> That's the way it is.
<s> Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
<s> He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
<s> They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
<s> Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
<s> 'Preciate it. Claude.
<s> Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
<s> I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
<s> No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
<s> What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
<s> Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
<s> Shoot him, Wilkins!
<s> Anybody else need anything read?
<s> Greenville, that the nearest town?
<s> Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
<s> Me? Willie Long.
<s> They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
<s> Understood.
<s> If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
<s> Let her go.
<s> All right. Let me out.
<s> You mother...
<s> Urr... uggg... errr...
<s> You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
<s> Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
<s> It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
<s> I can't screw.  I can't screw.
<s> I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
<s> Put it in your mouth.
<s> Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
<s> I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
<s> Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
<s> The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
<s> Everything's fine, pop.
<s> Please, pop, just go back to your room.
<s> The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
<s> And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
<s> I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
<s> What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
<s> That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
<s> I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
<s> Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
<s> Dude. Seriously?
<s> "Octopus people?"
<s> It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
<s> Sometimes, sure.
<s> Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
<s> Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
<s> East Rutherford.
<s> "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
<s> I have to, Valerie.
<s> I love you.
<s> Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
<s> A black guy?
<s> I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
<s> Anything to eat?
<s> You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
<s> From? From? From?
<s> Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
<s> Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
<s> I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
<s> I'm in my party mood.
<s> You? Why? You're already beautiful.
<s> I'm fine...  See you...
<s> Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
<s> Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
<s> Jessica.
<s> Curious.
<s> How a Sandman lives.
<s> You know.
<s> I'm going to run.
<s> It's different now. Help me.
<s> That's nice.
<s> But what is this -- why?
<s> Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
<s> Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
<s> It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
<s> The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
<s> He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
<s> You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
<s> We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
<s> Hello.
<s> For as long as I can remember.
<s> I have always been here...
<s> Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
<s> Stay? They lived together all their years?
<s> Texaco... What's wrong with that?
<s> They're comin' with us.
<s> This is our bedroom.
<s> His or ours?
<s> Yeah, I remember.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Over there.
<s> Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
<s> I can't see you tonight.
<s> Why are ya goin' so early?
<s> What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
<s> We killed him.
<s> Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
<s> Do ya good.
<s> Yeah? what did they want?
<s> No.
<s> The wife killer?
<s> Out in back.
<s> No... Here he comes.
<s> I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
<s> I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
<s> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
<s> Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
<s> Alice who?
<s> Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
<s> Two detectives are coming out.
<s> I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
<s> Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
<s> Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
<s> Okay.
<s> Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
<s> You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
<s> At your house. Don't you remember?
<s> Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
<s> I don't want to talk about it...
<s> I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
<s> You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
<s> Thank you.
<s> It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
<s> Yes.
<s> You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
<s> Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
<s> I beg your pardon.
<s> Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> It certainly is.
<s> Now you're irritating and absurd!
<s> Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
<s> Come on, Lovey.
<s> In a quandary.
<s> Say, what about that gold deal?
<s> All right.
<s> There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
<s> Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
<s> That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
<s> Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
<s> A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
<s> Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
<s> Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
<s> And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
<s> The only one.
<s> Shall we have another?
<s> No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
<s> Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
<s> Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
<s> You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
<s> Now, what would you like to do?
<s> Oh, dear.
<s> No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
<s> Are you the High Lama?
<s> But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
<s> You?
<s> How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
<s> Yes, Bob.
<s> Yes.
<s> You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
<s> There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
<s> I don't see that there's anything to say.
<s> She's going with me.
<s> Why not?
<s> I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
<s> I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
<s> You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
<s> I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
<s> You see, it's not a dream.
<s> Struggling, why?
<s> Why, mother?
<s> I'd love it!
<s> How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
<s> We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
<s> Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
<s> And if I say yes?
<s> They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
<s> Actually, sir--
<s> All the time, sir.
<s> Why?  What are you gonna do?
<s> You don't know the half of it.
<s> History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
<s> Get back in the car!
<s> Since as long as we've been keeping records...
<s> I'd double it and add 20.
<s> Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
<s> Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
<s> Do have any idea what I just said?
<s> Why not?
<s> Actually... I don't know.
<s> Are you sure you don't?
<s> Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
<s> Scientific American?  Really?
<s> May I have a look?
<s> The what?
<s> Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
<s> If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
<s> You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
<s> Found?  Where?
<s> Because I found out about her...
<s> Right.  I know --
<s> It's all I could safely move.
<s> We know each other?
<s> Yes, you did.
<s> And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
<s> I can't even stand up --
<s> The nano... what?
<s> On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
<s> Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
<s> I understand.  What's the other thing?
<s> He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
<s> Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
<s> Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
<s> Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
<s> Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
<s> We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
<s> There's no question.  You don't have any.
<s> Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
<s> It helps if you don't think of them as human.
<s> Oh... Hi, John.
<s> There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
<s> I need your help.
<s> So?
<s> I guess that's all of it.
<s> Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
<s> You gotta have faith, Dad.
<s> The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
<s> Some -- somebody's father?
<s> No.
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> You're not gonna kill me...
<s> The what?
<s> I'm... not... a... killer.
<s> If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
<s> I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
<s> You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
<s> I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
<s> So you won't help me?
<s> Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
<s> I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
<s> The safest place of all.
<s> Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
<s> Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
<s> It's always in the more gifted of the three.
<s> I thought you were retiring?
<s> No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
<s> The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
<s> How?
<s> We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
<s> Shhh.  You know what I hear?
<s> There's thousands of units like this one.
<s> No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
<s> Two?
<s> I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
<s> Knott!
<s> Who?
<s> I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
<s> Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
<s> Have you been there recently?
<s> I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
<s> What if I gave you forty?
<s> Somebody's getting comfortable.
<s> You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
<s> No more.
<s> He's not doing it.
<s> Mommy's not home?
<s> I love you. Come home.
<s> The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
<s> Shhh. He'll hear you.
<s> Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
<s> I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
<s> Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
<s> We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
<s> No.
<s> Why?
<s> Then what are you saying?
<s> You told him you liked him.
<s> He'll work it off.
<s> We get it. We're sorry.
<s> I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
<s> Where's the drop?
<s> Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
<s> Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
<s> Excuse me, we need to make a call.
<s> Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
<s> Yeah. I know the number.
<s> He didn't say we need guns.
<s> No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
<s> Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
<s> This paint sucks. The white shows through.
<s> Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
<s> But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
<s> Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
<s> Fuck...
<s> Sold it, stole it, whatever...
<s> You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
<s> His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
<s> I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
<s> Fuck this.
<s> Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
<s> Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
<s> I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
<s> What happened to the fifteen hundred?
<s> No more, man.
<s> Tom. How's it going?
<s> Bobby and Ricky.
<s> What do you mean 'kinda?'
<s> Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
<s> Cool. See you later.
<s> Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
<s> Where do you live?
<s> Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
<s> Why? What I say bad?
<s> I'll tell him someone else told me.
<s> So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
<s> Soho Grand, right?
<s> Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
<s> Different.
<s> Yeah, bring us four fernet.
<s> You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
<s> Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
<s> But, Max --
<s> Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
<s> Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
<s> Bet you like that shit.
<s> YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
<s> Nnnnnnn!
<s> I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
<s> That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
<s> Elijah who?
<s> You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
<s> I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
<s> But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
<s> Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
<s> You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
<s> Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
<s> Read it and keep on reading.
<s> Then the devil is white.
<s> I sure met some.
<s> But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
<s> You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
<s> Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
<s> How do you like it?
<s> If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
<s> Yes. Did you eat?
<s> What do you think?
<s> We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
<s> You have to sleep for three.
<s> I don't think that's such a good idea.
<s> Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
<s> That's right.
<s> You put it very well.
<s> Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
<s> What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
<s> All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
<s> How long has this been going on?
<s> ...That isn't a whore?
<s> Well, bitch you move too slow.
<s> Well, all reet, then.
<s> Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
<s> Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
<s> You're too small to be Bogart.
<s> I ain't doing bad.
<s> Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
<s> The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
<s> What can you do?
<s> So what about him?
<s> Brothers of Brother Johnson.
<s> I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
<s> Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
<s> Where?
<s> [No!]
<s> [Who are you?]
<s> I don't know, but I know his face.
<s> [In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
<s> [I want you.]
<s> [Your brother wants to talk to you.]
<s> [You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
<s> [O.K. So tell me more.]
<s> I drink.
<s> My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
<s> Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
<s> What do you mean, I'm here?
<s> Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
<s> A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
<s> Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
<s> Pinta...
<s> If they like me.
<s> Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
<s> Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
<s> I'm a bargain.
<s> Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
<s> Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
<s> Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
<s> It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
<s> No, that was in Columbia.
<s> Yeah. Two or three.
<s> I dropped her at home.
<s> Dyslexic?
<s> The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
<s> The traffic takes some getting used to.
<s> If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
<s> Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
<s> Yeah? And if she was ugly?
<s> I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
<s> For a year?
<s> Her beauty fucks with your mind.
<s> Hmm?
<s> Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
<s> What? Who?
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
<s> What was she to Creasy then?
<s> She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
<s> You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
<s> Which one was that?
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> She probably got a date by now, Angie.
<s> My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
<s> It must be one o'clock.
<s> Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
<s> Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
<s> What happen?
<s> I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
<s> You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
<s> This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
<s> You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
<s> These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
<s> Were the lights on?
<s> This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
<s> I'm afraid of being lonely.
<s> I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
<s> Please...
<s> Please...
<s> Okay.
<s> It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
<s> Sure.
<s> I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
<s> Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
<s> Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
<s> What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
<s> Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
<s> I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
<s> You gonna die without a son.
<s> Marty...
<s> Sure.
<s> I heard you, Ma.
<s> The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
<s> Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
<s> I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
<s> Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
<s> Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
<s> You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
<s> I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
<s> That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
<s> Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
<s> Same general idea.
<s> We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
<s> Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
<s> You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
<s> Yeah, if I can.
<s> Same here. You can retire my number.
<s> We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
<s> Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
<s> It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
<s> And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
<s> Don't stop now! Please...
<s> Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
<s> Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
<s> Right.
<s> We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
<s> He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
<s> 'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
<s> Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
<s> Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
<s> Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
<s> Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
<s> How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
<s> We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
<s> I didn't have much choice.
<s> Yeah!
<s> Thanks.
<s> The one and only.
<s> Poker sounds great. When do you play?
<s> There's only one worth noticing.
<s> Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
<s> He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
<s> Nope, we're assigned heah.
<s> They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
<s> I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
<s> There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
<s> It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
<s> But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
<s> A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
<s> Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
<s> No.
<s> Me?
<s> Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
<s> Thirty dollars.
<s> John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
<s> All set, Ann?
<s> No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
<s> Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
<s> Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
<s> You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
<s> Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
<s> You bet I will, Ma.
<s> What letter?
<s> There is no letter.
<s> A deal?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
<s> We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Beany!
<s> . . . Tubby?
<s> The heelots!
<s> Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
<s> It must be some kind of a gag.
<s> You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
<s> Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
<s> The elevators are still runnin'.
<s> What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
<s> Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
<s> John Doe Club?
<s> Yeah. It certainly is.
<s> There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
<s> And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
<s> Thanks.
<s> I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
<s> I think it must have been a sea- gull.
<s> You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
<s> You want me to go up with you?
<s> So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
<s> What happened, Mike.
<s> Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
<s> Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
<s> Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
<s> Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
<s> Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
<s> Then where's my FUCKING car!
<s> Am I gettin' the car?
<s> Is there a problem?
<s> Wait a minute, lemme see that.
<s> Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
<s> Solis said to keep you clear of this.
<s> Roper, we're into it...
<s> Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
<s> Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
<s> You living together?
<s> Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
<s> Yes.
<s> I do.
<s> Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
<s> About six years. My partner took me.
<s> Police corruption. It's everywhere.
<s> I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
<s> Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
<s> I'm not drunk. Yet.
<s> You got a bet on the game tonight?
<s> And it's hard to get.
<s> Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
<s> Hmm?
<s> Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
<s> I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, I believe he has --
<s> -- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
<s> No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
<s> -- No.
<s> No...
<s> That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
<s> Yes.
<s> And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
<s> -- Two million people plugged-in here.
<s> One would assume so.
<s> Unfinished business.
<s> Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
<s> You've got the keys, send someone in --
<s> Who are you?!

<s> Not you.  A copy.
<s> Activated.

<s> How can we reach Phaedos?
<s> They're called squirbs.
<s> Ah... sure.
<s> OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
<s> Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!

<s> We could smell it's breath.
<s> There's enough for everybody!
<s> If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
<s> A real shame.
<s> What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
<s> You forgot to say 'Simon says."
<s> What do you mean "basically"?
<s> How'd you know?
<s> Strength in numbers!!
<s> When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
<s> And a lot more. Can we talk?
<s> Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
<s> Charlie Luciano.
<s> Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
<s> I came into this world flat on my ass.
<s> I guess I am. Just a little.
<s> He was around...
<s> He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
<s> How's Bugsy doin'?
<s> Who hired the bastard?
<s> Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
<s> If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
<s> I can just imagine.
<s> I must be going.
<s> I was calling yesterday.
<s> I needed to see you again.
<s> Why? You're the innocent one.
<s> I'm very sorry... I didn't...
<s> A million bucks. In the last six months.
<s> So what is the problem?
<s> Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
<s> It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
<s> Guess I'm not a single type guy.
<s> Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
<s> Like a party for all our friends.
<s> I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
<s> Might as well put the time to use.
<s> It's not myself I'm worried about.
<s> I told you twenty!
<s> Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
<s> I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
<s> He's trying to make it.
<s> That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
<s> Didn't know you felt that way.
<s> I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
<s> Tell me, Charlie. Please.
<s> But that's an hour's drive.
<s> The kid just called me stupid.
<s> Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
<s> You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
<s> I've got friends.
<s> I found that out.
<s> Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
<s> I turned him down flat.
<s> And what do you want out of this?
<s> Come on. Be polite.
<s> We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
<s> If it comes to that. Yeah.
<s> Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
<s> That a Jew compliment?
<s> Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
<s> Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
<s> Switch hands.
<s> They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
<s> Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
<s> Uhh - martini?
<s> I didn't say anything.
<s> Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
<s> Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
<s> Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
<s> Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
<s> Why?
<s> My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
<s> A piata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
<s> Tell me what?
<s> You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
<s> Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
<s> YOU SET ME UP!!
<s> Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
<s> Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
<s> Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
<s> My <u>tail</u> itches.
<s> Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
<s> Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
<s> Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
<s> Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
<s> Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
<s> Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
<s> I just need to use the phone, lady.
<s> What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
<s> We like to think so, yeah.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> What pictures?
<s> Aaron?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> Goodbye, sweetheart.
<s> Oh, it was such a big scandal.
<s> Are you sure you got my bag in?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
<s> ... Oh ...
<s> Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
<s> Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
<s> Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
<s> Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
<s> I did not--

<s> Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
<s> You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
<s> You know--little worms--ambition.
<s> Whadaya mean--*right*?
<s> "There's more light here," he says--
<s> Waiter!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Good idea. When?
<s> I'll cherish ya.
<s> Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
<s> Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
<s> Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
<s> Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
<s> Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
<s> Oh--Jim!
<s> I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
<s> Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
<s> What stuff?
<s> Emma! Will you *please*--?
<s> Emma!
<s> Why, of course.
<s> Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
<s> To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
<s> I yield.
<s> His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
<s> No.
<s> The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
<s> Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
<s> That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
<s> Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
<s> The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
<s> Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
<s> No, Jeff--please--!
<s> Well--I'll go to Halifax!
<s> Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
<s> Well--he's got nothing on me.
<s> Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
<s> Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
<s> Committee, huh?
<s> Calendar?
<s> Thanks very much.
<s> Yes, Senator--*twice*.
<s> Try sitting down.
<s> But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
<s> No complaints.
<s> Go right ahead.
<s> No!
<s> And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
<s> Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
<s> Goodnight, Senator--
<s> You're not going to take your *suit* off!
<s> Yes, sir--
<s> The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
<s> Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
<s> What do you mean? What's going on?
<s> Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
<s> Susan!
<s> By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
<s> You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
<s> You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
<s> But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
<s> I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
<s> Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
<s> Maybe he won't get up.
<s> Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
<s> Such pretty knees for a big boy!
<s> Senator Paine.
<s> It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
<s> Page boys!
<s> Who are you?
<s> That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
<s> Some people like it.
<s> Morning, neighbors. Morning.
<s> Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
<s> Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
<s> Sometimes he whistles.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes!
<s> Yes!
<s> Yes, but I
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> What did they say?
<s> What did they say?
<s> Yes.
<s> You can almost spit on it, can't you?
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm from a small town too, you know.
<s> You have?
<s> He did? I play the tuba
<s> Are you? When?
<s> Don't be ridiculous.
<s> With pay!
<s> I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
<s> Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
<s> Babe ought to get him drunk again.
<s> Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I wanna see that guy!
<s> They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
<s> This is outrageous!
<s> Mr. Cedar!
<s> I'm not interested in the newspapers.
<s> Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
<s> Okay.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
<s> Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
<s> Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
<s> Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
<s> Is Mr. Deeds in?
<s> "There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
<s> Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
<s> Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
<s> Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
<s> Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
<s> Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
<s> Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
<s> That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
<s> You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
<s> Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
<s> Not at all.
<s> I'm a writer myself, you know.
<s> I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Now you keep out of this!
<s> Thank you so much. Good night.
<s> Prairie? Oysters?
<s> Oh, I do too, sir.
<s> Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
<s> What, sir?
<s> What's that?
<s> Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
<s> You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
<s> Now we're back on track.
<s> There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
<s> Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
<s> I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
<s> What do you do?
<s> A little.
<s> No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
<s> It's a pretty piece of land.
<s> Why do you watch?
<s> Where am I supposed to eat?
<s> You would have met in some shower eventually...
<s> Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
<s> Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
<s> -- Go on!
<s> There's something I think we need to talk about.
<s> Why don't you tell me?
<s> Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
<s> Hmm.
<s> We'll turn back anytime you want.
<s> Something's bothering her.
<s> Be specific.
<s> Is that like a party trick?
<s> You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
<s> Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
<s> That's... good?
<s> I don't know if --
<s> What was that?
<s> Transference.
<s> Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
<s> It's called pro bono.
<s> It's my bit for the community.
<s> If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
<s> What happened today?
<s> What'd he say?
<s> He agreed?
<s> Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
<s> Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
<s> Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
<s> This --
<s> Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
<s> You are Panda, monarch of modems.
<s> Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
<s> Everybody has a story, Skip.
<s> Holy shit!
<s> Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
<s> Wow.
<s> Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
<s> Relax, I got him.
<s> So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
<s> It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
<s> That's one way of putting it.
<s> Oh yes, always.
<s> When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
<s> What is he doing here?
<s> It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
<s> Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
<s> What did you do to him!?
<s> Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
<s> He said... he was just looking for a good time.
<s> I am an English woman.
<s> The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
<s> I know my treasure.
<s> We're about to be shown the way.
<s> Preparation for what?
<s> Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
<s> No you're not.
<s> Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
<s> He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
<s> Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
<s> Still...
<s> Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
<s> Be nice. That thing saved my life.
<s> Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
<s> I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
<s> Head hunting.
<s> And some sandwiches --
<s> Or even what it looks like.
<s> What did he mean?
<s> Hello?
<s> Sure.
<s> It's me... Elizabeth.
<s> Should I kill them?
<s> I thought you'd chickened out on me.
<s> Curiosity.
<s> I saw him walk you home.
<s> Alone tonight?
<s> Why?
<s> Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
<s> It's home.
<s> What have they got that we ain't got?
<s> Me, too.
<s> Monica, where are you?
<s> And what if you get killed?
<s> I just know.
<s> And you are a fool.
<s> The wise snake coils before he strikes.
<s> And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
<s> He is in love. His anger is gone.
<s> With what?
<s> Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
<s> Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
<s> No.
<s> We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
<s> Mother... it's not what you think!
<s> We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
<s> Or both.
<s> The who?
<s> I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
<s> I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
<s> Proceed.
<s> I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
<s> General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
<s> And, what a delightful idea!
<s> Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
<s> What do you have in mind?
<s> Where are they?
<s> They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
<s> I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
<s> Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
<s> I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
<s> You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
<s> Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
<s> Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
<s> Oh?
<s> What is that?
<s> I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
<s> I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
<s> I'll have the fire built up.
<s> Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
<s> Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
<s> Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
<s> One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
<s> Lisette La Croix.
<s> I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
<s> And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
<s> Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
<s> Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
<s> Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
<s> I know what you're doing in there.
<s> What are you doing in there?
<s> I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
<s> Certainly.
<s> God help me -- yes.
<s> I know.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes.
<s> And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
<s> My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
<s> Yes, I do -- very much.
<s> Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
<s> Does she deserve anything better?
<s> We have a treaty with Austria.
<s> That is a matter of opinion.
<s> Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
<s> Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
<s> My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
<s> Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
<s> Why you say that?
<s> Don't move me.
<s> That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
<s> What about the dog?
<s> Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
<s> Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
<s> Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
<s> You walked?
<s> D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
<s> Fuuuuuuck -- U!
<s> Nothing.
<s> That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
<s> Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
<s> Better sooner than later.
<s> I said hold on!
<s> No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
<s> Smokin' what?
<s> Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
<s> Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
<s> You don't wanna know.
<s> Go for it.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
<s> He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
<s> Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
<s> Nothing.  What you want?
<s> Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
<s> Shut yo' ass up.
<s> Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
<s> For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
<s> San Diego.
<s> My security people are right next door.
<s> I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
<s> I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
<s> Indeed.
<s> Same to you.
<s> I'd like to know what...
<s> What's your point?
<s> Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
<s> Where did you get these? Who are you?
<s> The gun...
<s> You fucked up.
<s> How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
<s> Let me talk to her again.
<s> No, that's,..that's fine
<s> I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
<s> Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
<s> I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
<s> On TV.
<s> Nods.
<s> No, kisses to...
<s> I'm just an accountant.
<s> Keep it.
<s> Oh, man...
<s> What?
<s> The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
<s> No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
<s> Yeah, all right, listen...
<s> Thank you.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
<s> Go ahead, sugar Die.
<s> Do it!
<s> He carried on some; kicked.
<s> No.
<s> What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
<s> What religion do you profess, Preacher?
<s> Keep talkin', Preacher.
<s> Dad, you're bleeding...
<s> Not even her?
<s> And I won't never tell about the money.
<s> When'll the skiff be ready?
<s> But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
<s> Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
<s> Sshhh! He's in there.
<s> Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
<s> You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
<s> And he killed every last one of 'em!
<s> Come on!
<s> Tricked us!
<s> Icey, I don't want a husband.
<s> The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
<s> It's a shame!
<s> I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
<s> There! What's so hard about that!
<s> You better not sing that song.
<s> 'Cause you're too little.
<s> She's gone to Moundsville.
<s> Hush, Pearl. Come on.
<s> He ain't my Dad.
<s> Is that all?
<s> It -- she --
<s> Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
<s> I don't know nothin'!
<s> Under the stone in the floor.
<s> What's your name?
<s> Will you buy me a choclit sody?
<s> A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
<s> Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
<s> Harry, what --
<s> I -- no, I --
<s> It's not in the river, is it Harry?
<s> Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
<s> How'do.
<s> Where's she at?
<s> How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
<s> None of your business, Madam.
<s> When did I ever?
<s> Pearl and John.
<s> What?
<s> I sure as hell hope so.
<s> It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
<s> R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
<s> Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
<s> Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
<s> You got a sane explanation for what he did?
<s> I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
<s> I will.
<s> Put that damned thing down!
<s> Dead and gone.
<s> Nobody's gonna kill you.
<s> Have you any money?
<s> Naturally, Comrade.
<s> It's from Paris.
<s> You should be more careful, Anna.
<s> I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
<s> I have nothing to hide.
<s> Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
<s> As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
<s> You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
<s> I don't want to go to Siberia.
<s> Positively not!
<s> Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
<s> Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
<s> What is it?
<s> Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
<s> No, that's bad management.
<s> Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
<s> I think I need my glasses.
<s> In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
<s> Good morning, Gaston.
<s> Good evening, Monsieur.
<s> Go to bed.
<s> Eight forty-two, sir.
<s> You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
<s> Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
<s> May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
<s> Yes.
<s> Certainly.
<s> That's perfect!
<s> Thank you, Louis.
<s> Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
<s> Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
<s> Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
<s> Oh, Leon, you are so good.
<s> We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> Razinin.
<s> What did she say about me?
<s> Just looking around.
<s> Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
<s> No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
<s> Even the swallows are back.
<s> The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
<s> No visa.
<s> That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
<s> No.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> That's a strange angle.
<s> He takes good care of that.
<s> For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
<s> Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
<s> What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
<s> I'd like to say it a thousand times.
<s> That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
<s> Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
<s> I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
<s> Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
<s> I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
<s> Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
<s> That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
<s> No.
<s> A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
<s> Ninotchka, I love you.
<s> It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
<s> What, darling?
<s> I love you, my little Leonitchka!
<s> It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
<s> Who cried that one?
<s> It is their wish.
<s> Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
<s> Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
<s> A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
<s> I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
<s> This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
<s> There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
<s> It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
<s> Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
<s> We have nothing to discuss.
<s> Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
<s> Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
<s> Why?
<s> I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
<s> No.
<s> It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
<s> "Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
<s> Yes ... I got the money.
<s> In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
<s> That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
<s> Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
<s> Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
<s> He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
<s> Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
<s> Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
<s> He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
<s> And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
<s> It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
<s> That's what they're doing.
<s> I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
<s> So?
<s> Can we get around this, Al?
<s> I know it well, sir.
<s> It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
<s> Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
<s> Silence!
<s> "Security" is not strong enough.
<s> We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
<s> You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
<s> I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
<s> Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
<s> Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
<s> Jesus!
<s> You never told him?
<s> Money.  Follow the money.
<s> It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
<s> Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
<s> I believe you're right, boss.
<s> Sir?
<s> Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
<s> ... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
<s> Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
<s> What about happiness, Mother?
<s> Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
<s> Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
<s> Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
<s> It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
<s> He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
<s> Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
<s> We'll see about that.
<s> She's quite pretty.
<s> Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
<s> It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
<s> Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
<s> But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
<s> Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
<s> You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
<s> When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
<s> You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
<s> Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
<s> You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
<s> One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
<s> My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
<s> I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
<s> ... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
<s> Ernie Davis.
<s> That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
<s> Elvis I like, too.
<s> She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
<s> What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
<s> The hell with 'em.
<s> I've missed you.
<s> Sometimes I think that's what you want.
<s> But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
<s> When?
<s> Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
<s> Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
<s> To what?
<s> Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
<s> Whatcha mean by that?
<s> The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
<s> All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
<s> Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
<s> It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I don't know. My mind wanders.
<s> Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
<s> That's very linear Sheriff.
<s> I don't know...
<s> That's possible.
<s> Gun out and up.
<s> Sheriff?
<s> I'm ahead of you there.
<s> I don't know. He ought to...
<s> Wasn't no bullet.
<s> No sir.
<s> There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
<s> Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
<s> Okay.
<s> My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
<s> It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
<s> It's full a money.
<s> No. I found it.
<s> Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
<s> Well -- how come?
<s> C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
<s> You should be used to that.
<s> Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
<s> Yes ma'am?
<s> Hey.
<s> No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
<s> She'll be all right.
<s> I know something better.
<s> It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
<s> Where does he work?
<s> Is Llewelyn there?
<s> Step out of the car please, sir.
<s> No me mate.
<s> Huh? Airport or airstrip?
<s> I don't need to talk to you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sixty-nine cent.
<s> Y'all getting any rain up your way?
<s> I didn't mean nothin' by it.
<s> You already asked me that.
<s> What time do you close?
<s> You live in that house behind the store?
<s> Sir?
<s> Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
<s> Never mind.  I want a tent.
<s> The kind with the most poles.
<s> When did you last see him.
<s> How well do you know Chigurh.
<s> That's not an answer.
<s> I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
<s> Okay. We can stop that.
<s> You want to change rooms?
<s> That's got two double beds.
<s> I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
<s> How would you describe him?
<s> Yes.
<s> What product.
<s> He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
<s> I don't know. American citizens.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No sir. I'm a veteran.
<s> Yes sir. Two tours.
<s> Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
<s> She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
<s> You think a woman did that?!
<s> ...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
<s> That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
<s> That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
<s> Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
<s> ...to see you.
<s> Umm, I don't think that...
<s> I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
<s> I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
<s> What?
<s> Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
<s> No, Del.
<s> You're late, Eric.
<s> Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
<s> It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
<s> I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
<s> Ad lib?
<s> ...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
<s> Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
<s> I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
<s> Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
<s> Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
<s> Really?
<s> He has no heartbeat!
<s> 'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
<s> Man, that is love.
<s> Who?
<s> Shhh! I heard you the first time.
<s> This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
<s> You never know who you'll see.
<s> To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
<s> I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
<s> Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
<s> I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
<s> No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
<s> Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
<s> Beer, please.
<s> What 'look'?
<s> I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
<s> ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
<s> Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
<s> They paid us half. They still owe us half...
<s> I know that.
<s> What the hell's the matter with you?
<s> You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
<s> No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
<s> Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
<s> Where? Where is she?
<s> Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
<s> You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
<s> No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
<s> She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
<s> No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
<s> I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
<s> I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
<s> No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
<s> No! Let me try this!
<s> Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
<s> ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
<s> Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
<s> The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
<s> "A Reason to Love."
<s> Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
<s> Our pleasure, Big Dan.
<s> Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
<s> The law. Well the law is a human institution.
<s> How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
<s> That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
<s> No, they never did turn me into a toad.
<s> Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
<s> Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
<s> Gopher, Everett?
<s> Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
<s> Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
<s> We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
<s> In any state.
<s> ...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
<s> Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
<s> No weddin'.
<s> Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
<s> It was in his bureau.
<s> Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
<s> Million point two.
<s> Isn't it, uh...
<s> Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
<s> Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
<s> We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
<s> Blooey!
<s> Buyin' nipples!
<s> Yes, Sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
<s> Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
<s> You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
<s> Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
<s> Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
<s> Nobody. It just came to me.
<s> I never said any of that!
<s> Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
<s> Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
<s> No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
<s> Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
<s> Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
<s> I didn't call you anything before that.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
<s> He was. He died.
<s> I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
<s> Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
<s> What?
<s> Well, I'll be goddamned.
<s> One more minute.
<s> Great.
<s> He didn't give you much choice.
<s> To have a good time with you until you have to go.
<s> You're better than candy.
<s> That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
<s> God.
<s> Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
<s> So?
<s> Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
<s> Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
<s> I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
<s> It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
<s> She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
<s> Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
<s> No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
<s> But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
<s> Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
<s> Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
<s> I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
<s> Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
<s> Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
<s> We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
<s> Hey.
<s> Yeah, whatever.
<s> Huh?
<s> He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
<s> The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
<s> I said open the door.
<s> Don't!
<s> He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
<s> How many more do we have after this?
<s> This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
<s> They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
<s> Say fuck.
<s> Give me a break.
<s> Little bit.  Yeah.
<s> Come on, come on...
<s> Shhh...
<s> On it!
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I was trying not to tell you...
<s> What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
<s> I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
<s> You know it brother.
<s> Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
<s> You know it. Stay Black...
<s> Man, fuck you!!!
<s> Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
<s> Cy... I ain't even sure.
<s> N... N...... Not... Oh.
<s> Can you make a deal with them?
<s> Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
<s> And did you witness the shoot-out?
<s> I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
<s> Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
<s> Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
<s> We're like policing the police.
<s> Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
<s> You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
<s> A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
<s> If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
<s> Just a kid.
<s> Just the legit shit.
<s> If you got something to say, say it.
<s> Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
<s> Later for that. I'm done either way...
<s> Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
<s> No.
<s> I expect to try.
<s> He's not making light.
<s> Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
<s> Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
<s> First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
<s> My pleasure, sir.
<s> I will do so as soon as possible.
<s> And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
<s> Prisoner exchange.
<s> Sir.
<s> Probably.
<s> You're in no condition to ride.
<s> It's already over.
<s> Is that so?
<s> And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
<s> I should have killed him when I had the chance?
<s> No...
<s> Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
<s> She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
<s> Go on.
<s> You said bribery twice...
<s> I am, I think.
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't know.
<s> Goodbye, Harry.
<s> Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
<s> Earned.
<s> But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
<s> Do you believe that?
<s> Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
<s> Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
<s> For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
<s> Does she love the cat?
<s> No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
<s> Because it's right.
<s> Wouldn't wash?
<s> Wendigo?
<s> This babe has said enough.
<s> My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
<s> Remember.
<s> Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
<s> She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
<s> According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
<s> That's forgotten.
<s> Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
<s> They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
<s> She.  Goes.  Free.
<s> And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
<s> Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
<s> That's right.
<s> Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
<s> I want you to leave.  And never come back.
<s> Very well.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
<s> Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
<s> Boy overboard!
<s> His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
<s> Commodore, you can't do that!
<s> I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
<s> If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
<s> -- then we never would have met.
<s> Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
<s> -- but that was not a proper kiss.
<s> I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
<s> No, I'm -- rescuing you.
<s> Not when you can drink instead, at least.
<s> You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
<s> I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
<s> Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
<s> Smith.
<s> Indeed.
<s> Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
<s> He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
<s> -- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
<s> Yes, I have.
<s> Where did he come from?
<s> Have you found Dr. Bright?
<s> Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
<s> Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
<s> Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
<s> A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
<s> You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
<s> You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
<s> Ain't it.
<s> Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
<s> The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
<s> Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
<s> She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
<s> I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
<s> If you loved me like I loved you?
<s> Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
<s> You better quit pushing me, pal.
<s> Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
<s> Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
<s> Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
<s> I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
<s> Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
<s> Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
<s> It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
<s> Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
<s> If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
<s> Got it.
<s> The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
<s> I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
<s> Probably the caffeine.
<s> No problem.
<s> What did you want my hair for?
<s> Like a glove.
<s> Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
<s> What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
<s> Let's go.
<s> Yes.
<s> I have to!
<s> Oh yes you are!
<s> Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
<s> Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
<s> Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
<s> 'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
<s> Yes, he might be.
<s> Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
<s> Certainly. Right over there.
<s> I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
<s> No - give you another guess.
<s> Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
<s> It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
<s> When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
<s> Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
<s> Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
<s> Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
<s> Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
<s> Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
<s> Gallagher?
<s> Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
<s> I poisoned him.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
<s> Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
<s> Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
<s> I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
<s> All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
<s> Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
<s> Yeah?
<s> It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
<s> Gloria Golden?
<s> Now Mr. Smith, now please
<s> I beg your pardon, sir?
<s> Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
<s> I bet.
<s> I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
<s> On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
<s> Well!
<s> Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
<s> Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
<s> Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
<s> Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
<s> Yes.
<s> Hello, Stew.
<s> I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
<s> Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
<s> Yes - and I'd love it.
<s> Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
<s> Been where?
<s> Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
<s> You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
<s> Yeah?
<s> It'll be ready in a minute.
<s> Sorry, boss
<s> The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
<s> No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
<s> Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
<s> Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
<s> I beg your pardon.
<s> Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
<s> Hello, Joe.
<s> Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
<s> Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
<s> Now the lady said you may go
<s> Well, sir, I putter.
<s> Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
<s> That's all I wanted to know!
<s> Sure.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah ...  That--and ...
<s> No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
<s> In my handbag.
<s> Hello Bill.
<s> I'm sorry ...
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah. It does.
<s> It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
<s> I don't want it to go away.
<s> Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
<s> You want to get out of here?
<s> What?
<s> What's the matter?
<s> "Changes."
<s> Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
<s> Still doesn't make it right.
<s> It was accessible to everyone.
<s> You're not allowed to lie.
<s> Why am I out of order?
<s> Oh. guess I could do that, then.
<s> Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
<s> You--you gotta get us out of here.
<s> Owns the hardware store.
<s> We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
<s> One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
<s> It's in your closet.
<s> Jen please ...
<s> So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
<s> You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
<s> Honestly ... no.
<s> Right here.
<s> I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
<s> You don't know?
<s> Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
<s> Rain.
<s> Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
<s> No I won't. I swear.
<s> Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
<s> Yeah ... Sort of ...
<s> But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
<s> Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
<s> Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
<s> I can't.
<s> Re-runs?
<s> Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
<s> What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
<s> Why?
<s> There aren't any cheeseburgers.
<s> Why?
<s> ... What's that?
<s> Hi.
<s> Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
<s> Hey.
<s> So you can't talk to me?
<s> "chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
<s> Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
<s> I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
<s> D&D Mattress Man.
<s> I'm just stopping by to say hello.
<s> So it's ok if I bring her.
<s> Hello everyone.
<s> No.
<s> I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
<s> OH MY GOD. Look at that.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> ....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
<s> I....please don't do this.
<s> I just want to know where she's staying.
<s> -- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
<s> This is Georgia.
<s> So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
<s> Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
<s> I'm just laying on my bed.
<s> Are you watching a porno movie?
<s> Do you like porno movies?
<s> Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
<s> Are your pants off?
<s> I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
<s> ...yeah.....
<s> I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
<s> Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
<s> I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
<s> ....what....?
<s> See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
<s> This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
<s> No.
<s> It's fine. It was fun, though.
<s> Yeah, not really.
<s> Sure.
<s> Sure.
<s> It's Barry.
<s> You were talking about the promotion --
<s> I'm sorry. I thought you said --
<s> Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
<s> I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
<s> You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Can I come home with you when we get there?
<s> If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
<s> If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
<s> It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
<s> Did you do it?
<s> I know.
<s> That's fine.
<s> Yes it is.
<s> ......and this is confidential?
<s> 337.....I'm sorry....
<s> I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
<s> We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
<s> ....I have seven.
<s> Hi Walter.
<s> And I'm sorry that I did that.
<s> Hey...Lance....can I.....
<s> I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
<s> You should go on a trip.
<s> I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
<s> I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
<s> Please don't do this.
<s> Alright, alright.
<s> You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
<s> What is this, man?
<s> What time are you gonna be there?
<s> You can't be late though.
<s> Don't puss out.
<s> No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
<s> It's fine.
<s> Sorry.
<s> You ready?
<s> No.
<s> Ok.
<s> I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
<s> His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
<s> Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
<s> I've you to look after me, haven't I?
<s> "Turn you out?"
<s> What? What've I done?
<s> I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
<s> It's not even noon --
<s> It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
<s> Do I have your word?
<s> Good day, Marquis.
<s> His rug.
<s> Valcour. His chair.
<s> Because your writing continues, unchecked.
<s> I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
<s> A night spent with the partner of my choice.
<s> -- that was lust --
<s> Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
<s> This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
<s> A few indiscretions in his youth.
<s> I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
<s> But he's one among some two hundred wards --
<s> Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
<s> I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
<s> He's sworn to obedience.
<s> -- then I've friends of my own to visit.
<s> No. It most certainly was not.
<s> That's not our intent --
<s> Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
<s> What could cause a tincture like this?
<s> No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
<s> I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
<s> Yes?
<s> There's something else I want from you.
<s> Is it terribly erotic?
<s> The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
<s> You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
<s> Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
<s> I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
<s> It's tainted money, Doctor.
<s> Oh, but I am!
<s> They've put you up to this, haven't they?
<s> I'd rather read, thank-you.
<s> No, when I was but a tender lad--
<s> Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
<s> She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
<s> You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
<s> So I've been told.
<s> How much?
<s> Yes.
<s> You will not walk out on me
<s> I don't want you to--
<s> How so?
<s> He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
<s> We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
<s> Uh-huh
<s> Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
<s> Can I talk to Hearst?
<s> Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
<s> I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
<s> Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
<s> No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
<s> Orson, please ... it's too bright
<s> Orson. Stop. Just stop
<s> I expected more from you.
<s> How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
<s> Listen to me-
<s> When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
<s> And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
<s> Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
<s> Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
<s> And what does he see?
<s> And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
<s> Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
<s> You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
<s> And they went to the stockholders in New York.
<s> Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
<s> That's for me to decide.
<s> We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
<s> Get out
<s> Again.
<s> Again
<s> CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
<s> Ah, it's a grand title.
<s> Then find another theater
<s> "Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
<s> So, on to the Life Of Christ!
<s> What?
<s> What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
<s> I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
<s> Yeah. Do me a favor.
<s> Hit me in the face.
<s> I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
<s> Whadda you care?
<s> She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
<s> You know, like bang her or anything?
<s> Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
<s> I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
<s> Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
<s> I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
<s> Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
<s> Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
<s> I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
<s> Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
<s> Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
<s> You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
<s> Oh, Jake.
<s> Who asked you?
<s> Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
<s> Nobody. I love you, remember?
<s> Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
<s> "Father of the Bride."
<s> Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
<s> OK. Talk.
<s> What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
<s> I'm leaving you Jake.
<s> Are you drunk?
<s> Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
<s> Never felt better.
<s> I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
<s> Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
<s> He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
<s> Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
<s> You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
<s> Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
<s> From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
<s> Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
<s> All right -- you don't believe me.
<s> Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
<s> Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
<s> Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
<s> What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
<s> Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
<s> What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
<s> Oh -- I almost forgot!
<s> You think he's getting out of here?
<s> That depends on who "they" were.
<s> Like what?
<s> Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
<s> If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
<s> For getting rid of that cast.
<s> Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
<s> I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
<s> Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
<s> I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
<s> I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
<s> Who are you?
<s> She expects me to marry her.
<s> Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
<s> She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
<s> It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
<s> Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
<s> Get back there! He'll see you!
<s> Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
<s> There's something buried there.
<s> What?
<s> Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
<s> Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
<s> When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
<s> Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
<s> Going on right here. It's a big night.
<s> That's good news.
<s> You mean leave the magazine?
<s> For what?
<s> Of course not.
<s> Something too frightful to utter.
<s> You'd better before you catch the disease!
<s> Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
<s> There's nothing to see.
<s> And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
<s> He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
<s> He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
<s> Not yet!
<s> It doesn't make sense to me.
<s> Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
<s> You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
<s> But you're not?
<s> I'm glad they let you out.
<s> What?
<s> Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
<s> Know the Millertown bluff?
<s> Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
<s> You still want to go home, Moose?
<s> Hold it, Jim.
<s> Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
<s> We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
<s> That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
<s> Will you wait a minute?
<s> You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
<s> You don't?
<s> Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
<s> What's that pounding?
<s> Look--just relax, will you?
<s> Jim.  What's yours?
<s> They're still there!
<s> Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
<s> Yeah?
<s> We know.
<s> I'm here.  Shut up.
<s> It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
<s> There's only one key.
<s> Man, you're schizoid!
<s> Your father!
<s> Get away from me!
<s> I'm here.
<s> All right, darling.
<s> Goodbye, dear.
<s> I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
<s> Mom--I'm not--
<s> But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
<s> No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
<s> You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
<s> No.
<s> Leave me alone.
<s> She eats him alive and he takes it.
<s> "If he could" what?  You mean your father?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
<s> Now that's true!
<s> Won't mother be proud.
<s> Have you ever gone with anyone who--
<s> I feel as if I'm walking under water.
<s> Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
<s> Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
<s> You don't need to do that.
<s> I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
<s> Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
<s> Yes.  My best friend.
<s> Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
<s> Okay.
<s> Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
<s> He hates me.
<s> He hates me.
<s> I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
<s> My mother?
<s> We were romantic then too--
<s> What?
<s> I didn't want to stop.
<s> Don't hurt him...
<s> Please, Gabriel, don't...
<s> YES!!!
<s> ...whoever she is.
<s> -- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
<s> That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
<s> Radio said negative five.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Radio said.
<s> I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
<s> Tell me again.
<s> You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
<s> Your brother...
<s> What's going ON!!!
<s> Nick, I love you --
<s> For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
<s> So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
<s> Don't say my name...
<s> Part of... with them?
<s> I'm almost done.
<s> You said it a million times!
<s> You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
<s> I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
<s> Yes!
<s> Wish I had a brother like you.
<s> Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
<s> Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
<s> I don't know.
<s> And I worked there. For a year.
<s> Why not.
<s> We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
<s> Put it on.
<s> Don't tip.
<s> ...ttt..tt... two out of three?
<s> Nothing... I promise-nothing...
<s> What's the code?
<s> There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
<s> Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
<s> What... Powwow...
<s> We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
<s> There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
<s> I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
<s> Fuckin' freezing.
<s> He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
<s> It's a roach, guy --
<s> Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
<s> Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
<s> I'm just saying.
<s> Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
<s> I don't know, I've seen the business world.
<s> Good for you. Protein.
<s> YOU TELL HER!
<s> And you set me up.
<s> I... sorry, Mister...
<s> But... I had a five...
<s> There is no other table --
<s> Yes.
<s> Was he all pissed off?
<s> It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
<s> This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
<s> Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
<s> And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
<s> This better not be some Freddy joke.
<s> How can you tell?
<s> Did the two of you talk?
<s> Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
<s> A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
<s> It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
<s> It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
<s> Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
<s> What? Snap out of it!
<s> It's a change.
<s> Why am I Mr. Pink?
<s> Sorry, it's my book now.
<s> How many employees?
<s> Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
<s> Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
<s> Down to my car.
<s> Nice Guy Eddie.
<s> You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
<s> That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
<s> All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> It's not good...
<s> No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
<s> I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
<s> Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
<s> Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
<s> Uh-uh, just cops.
<s> What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
<s> You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
<s> How can you be so sure?
<s> Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
<s> For all I know, you're the rat.
<s> Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
<s> I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
<s> He asked.
<s> One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
<s> So you wanna git bit, huh?
<s> You takin' his side?
<s> Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
<s> Maybe he did.
<s> Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
<s> As far as -- Sonora?
<s> Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
<s> In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
<s> I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
<s> Hold on.
<s> No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
<s> I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
<s> Will she be dark or fair?
<s> Why do you think?
<s> Maybe it's better that way.
<s> You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
<s> The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
<s> That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
<s> What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
<s> Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
<s> You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
<s> Kind of sore.
<s> Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
<s> Nobody asked you to.
<s> Nobody asked you to.
<s> Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
<s> Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
<s> Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
<s> Well, say it.
<s> Depends on how good you drive.
<s> Now where's she goin'? --
<s> That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
<s> You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
<s> Everybody knows --
<s> Where is he?
<s> Lookin' around.
<s> I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
<s> Don't you even know your letters?
<s> No. We're not stayin' --
<s> That's the end of the line.
<s> Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
<s> You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
<s> Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
<s> Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> Steve --
<s> Goodnight, Miss Wells.
<s> In room "302" at ten o'clock?
<s> You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
<s> It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
<s> I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
<s> Alright!
<s> It looks like the furnace.
<s> Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
<s> Can you feel that?
<s> Oh.
<s> So, whatever happened to her?
<s> But he'll kill her!
<s> It's okay.
<s> I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
<s> Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
<s> Um, I'm not touching anything.
<s> Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
<s> Just wait, you'll see.
<s> Quick, everyone to the lab.
<s> I don't know, but I sure hope so.
<s> Uh, uh.
<s> Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
<s> It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
<s> Theo, did you see the animal?
<s> I wouldn't go that far.
<s> Who?
<s> Let me see the files.
<s> Any of them hot?
<s> Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
<s> What's this?
<s> Right. What about condoms?
<s> Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
<s> What?
<s> Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
<s> Oh, I couldn't do that.
<s> Second best.
<s> My help?
<s> How is she?
<s> Soon. First, I must bless this house.
<s> What?
<s> I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
<s> What happened?
<s> You don't think...
<s> Is MOM... in there?
<s> Jeeezzz!
<s> No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
<s> Is there a killer loose?
<s> Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
<s> Why?
<s> I don't feel like rewinding it!
<s> Let me see!
<s> Oh Mom...
<s> This is so silly. 
<s> Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
<s> Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
<s> And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
<s> I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
<s> Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
<s> I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
<s> We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
<s> Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
<s> It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> I certainly did.
<s> Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Marvin A. Pickles.
<s> You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
<s> Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
<s> I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
<s> Yes, but I lent it...
<s> Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
<s> Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
<s> You could go and open the door.
<s> You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
<s> What sort of danger?
<s> But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
<s> I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
<s> "The Dante?"
<s> Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
<s> What does she do with herself after business hours?
<s> Good.
<s> Yes.
<s> Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
<s> I know  I shouldn't have told you
<s> I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
<s> Not from me.
<s> Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
<s> You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
<s> But it's a small room, Jason.
<s> Don't make me tell you, Jason.
<s> I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
<s> I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
<s> We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
<s> I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
<s> She was my patient.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No. She's no longer under my care.
<s> I'm very, very serious.
<s> Why?
<s> She's not been here for a long time.
<s> Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
<s> No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
<s> Yes?
<s> Please.
<s> Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
<s> What?
<s> I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
<s> I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
<s> Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
<s> I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
<s> What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
<s> Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
<s> I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
<s> It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
<s> Kids? What about them?
<s> Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
<s> Do you want me to?
<s> You're in therapy?
<s> Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
<s> You had sex with you therapist?
<s> Can we look at one?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why not?
<s> It won't. Are you ready?
<s> Ann Bishop Millaney.
<s> Sometimes. Afterward.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
<s> Who was the last person you had sex with?
<s> So you lied to her?
<s> Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
<s> Possibly.
<s> Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
<s> Always the lawyer.
<s> I want out of this marriage.
<s> We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
<s> No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
<s> Yes!
<s> Not very often.
<s> Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
<s> Yeah, so?
<s> Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
<s> So it was recently that you tried this.
<s> I guess.
<s> Yes.
<s> But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
<s> Why?
<s> Do you have to say that?
<s> Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
<s> He doesn't have a phone.
<s> Let me talk to him first.
<s> What's wrong with that?
<s> What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
<s> Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
<s> But why did you want to?
<s> Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
<s> You are in trouble.
<s> I can't believe you did that!!
<s> You are in serious trouble.
<s> You want me to leave?
<s> Nope.
<s> I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
<s> What do you get?
<s> Why don't you let me tape you?
<s> Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
<s> Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
<s> That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
<s> Whichever you prefer.
<s> Just a moment.
<s> Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
<s> No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
<s> It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
<s> He said that my hand felt good.
<s> Is that what he tells you?
<s> Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
<s> Why?
<s> Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
<s> Cynthia. John.
<s> "The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
<s> I wish you hadn't done that.
<s> I just... Ann is very...
<s> You trust him.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You know which tapes! Where are they?
<s> So is my wife, asshole!!
<s> You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
<s> John Millaney.
<s> Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
<s> C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
<s> Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
<s> Nick, you're so strange...
<s> Just breathe normally.
<s> Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
<s> Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
<s> Gonna cut me open?
<s> Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
<s> Did I say anything?
<s> I don't get it.
<s> You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
<s> OK. I'll think about it.
<s> It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
<s> WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
<s> BREAKING OUT
<s> Time to check with Flavors.
<s> Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
<s> Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
<s> Now Betty, don't overreact.
<s> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
<s> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
<s> Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
<s> THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
<s> Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
<s> Of course.
<s> YOUNG BLOOD
<s> Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
<s> And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
<s> WHAT A JOKE...
<s> SIN-I-FUL
<s> ...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
<s> No.
<s> I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
<s> I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
<s> Well, then put him at the singles table.
<s> Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
<s> Highliner.
<s> A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
<s> Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
<s> They're just leftovers.
<s> Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
<s> In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
<s> Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
<s> Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
<s> No, we're paying for the wine.
<s> Yeah, Conundrum.
<s> You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
<s> 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
<s> I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
<s> Yeah, that would be a good move.
<s> Want some?
<s> So you're going to stop acting?
<s> It's going to be great. Here's to us.
<s> You know that chick?
<s> Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
<s> I want to go home now.
<s> You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
<s> I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
<s> Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
<s> Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
<s> Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
<s> I will.  See ya!
<s> Yep.
<s> Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
<s> Deep.
<s> Thanks, Jack.
<s> Obsessively.
<s> What's happening?
<s> You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
<s> Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
<s> I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
<s> Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
<s> What's that?
<s> Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
<s> What?
<s> Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
<s> No way. No way.
<s> Back at you.
<s> I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
<s> Yeah. Definitely.
<s> "The Day After Yesterday."
<s> I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Got it.
<s> What rehearsal dinner?
<s> Victoria.
<s> Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
<s> Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
<s> Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
<s> I am.
<s> See you over there, Miles.
<s> About four weeks.
<s> About a year.
<s> Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
<s> Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
<s> Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
<s> Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
<s> You got two minor league home run records don't you?
<s> I heard.
<s> I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
<s> I got him.
<s> Yes.
<s> The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
<s> Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
<s> They already know we're here.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
<s> I'm close.
<s> They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
<s> Have they said anything about our area?
<s> I just asked his name.
<s> Where are we going to sleep?
<s> Yeah baby. I think someone did.
<s> What was the first thing?
<s> I would say so.
<s> No.
<s> Six months.
<s> What friend is that?
<s> Sounds good.
<s> I already did that.
<s> I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
<s> I haven't done anything.
<s> Not for five years.
<s> No, Leavenworth.
<s> Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
<s> I expect.
<s> No hard feelings.
<s> Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
<s> I've got a job.
<s> She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
<s> The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
<s> Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
<s> We didn't get that far.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Rae, I need help.
<s> Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
<s> Because they enjoy it.
<s> You don't know?
<s> He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
<s> Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
<s> We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
<s> Thanks. That's what I call it too.
<s> You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
<s> I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
<s> Give me some of the good stuff.
<s> You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
<s> I wouldn't worry about that.
<s> That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
<s> It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
<s> Please.
<s> No problem.  Do you want to come in?
<s> There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
<s> You really think so?
<s> Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
<s> -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
<s> No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
<s> Not quite.
<s> Impossible.
<s> I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
<s> No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
<s> -- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
<s> That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
<s> Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
<s> Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
<s> So you did meet her?
<s> I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
<s> Do what you do to Simone.
<s> Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
<s> Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
<s> And what may I ask brought this on?
<s> I was misquoted.
<s> That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
<s> You do?
<s> I'm already dead.
<s> I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
<s> She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
<s> I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
<s> I read.
<s> I noticed.
<s> Really?  Too bad.
<s> I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
<s> Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
<s> I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
<s> It's a yacht.
<s> Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
<s> Maybe he's talking to himself.
<s> My God, you've got one?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Yes, I'd like that.
<s> Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
<s> Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
<s> Yes.  Yes, it is.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Goodnight, sweetheart.
<s> Dr. Crowe.
<s> That's good.
<s> How do you draw now?
<s> He your best buddy?
<s> Upset words.
<s> You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
<s> All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
<s> I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
<s> Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
<s> Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
<s> No.
<s> Oh.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Tell you my secrets.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They did?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Standing next to my window.
<s> Dead people.
<s> They want me to do things for them.
<s> Like what?
<s> You're a stuttering Stanley!
<s> Stop looking at me.
<s> Who!
<s> --Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
<s> J. C. Penny's?
<s> Let's say today, we make it your business.
<s> I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
<s> Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
<s> Bitch.
<s> Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
<s> Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
<s> Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
<s> Bus broke down.
<s> Metaphysical question, man.
<s> Harvest moonshining!
<s> Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
<s> Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
<s> Amends...?
<s> I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
<s> Who? Us?!
<s> Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
<s> What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
<s> Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
<s> Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
<s> Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
<s> No. Not without you --
<s> I was getting 'warmed' up.
<s> Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
<s> What'll we do?
<s> Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
<s> Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
<s> No. What?
<s> New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
<s> Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
<s> Just block the doors, any way you can.
<s> Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
<s> What?
<s> All the rib eyes?
<s> Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
<s> Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
<s> Grant, no!
<s> An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
<s> Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
<s> Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
<s> Okay.
<s> Shoot.
<s> Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
<s> We lost him.
<s> Enjoy your Kenworth.
<s> I would've come back for you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That man is your father?!?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> You gotta admire the man's determination.
<s> Another time.
<s> How'd you know?
<s> If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
<s> Running blocker.
<s> Save it. We got a long haul.
<s> This is Bandit I, come back.
<s> What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
<s> We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
<s> Pick it up, Breaker.
<s> What's up, Dixie Chicken?
<s> See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
<s> Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
<s> That's the point, Dickey.
<s> Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
<s> And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
<s> No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
<s> Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
<s> No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
<s> Shoot, I appreciate that man.
<s> Damn... alright then.
<s> Yeah, why.
<s> That's not possible. I told you.
<s> Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
<s> That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
<s> GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
<s> -- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
<s> They what? What? No. No. Why?
<s> I thought Heller was a double op?
<s> -- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
<s> -- You can and you will.
<s> ...So you made another deal?
<s> No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
<s> Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
<s> -- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
<s> None whatsoever.
<s> Yeah... Sid?
<s> Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
<s> Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
<s> Got hit twice.
<s> You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
<s> A Fed? Like FBI?
<s> ...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
<s> Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
<s> What?
<s> What's the time frame?
<s> We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, that's a relief.
<s> Shut up.
<s> And professionally?
<s> I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
<s> -- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
<s> Not necessarily.
<s> Get out --
<s> Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
<s> I'll go with you.
<s> Book?
<s> Rheya.  Not here.
<s> I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
<s> Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
<s> You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
<s> As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
<s> I been thinking about how much I hate you.
<s> What kind of look?
<s> I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
<s> It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
<s> You don't love me.
<s> That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
<s> You... she said I didn't love her.
<s> He is.  But he was here...
<s> I'm disgusting.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Neither did I.
<s> I can't stay here.
<s> Then you won't make it.
<s> I want to stop taking those pills.
<s> They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
<s> I can't --
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> We want to talk freely.
<s> You didn't like him?
<s> It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
<s> He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
<s> How did you know?
<s> No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
<s> Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
<s> What do you want?
<s> I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
<s> Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
<s> Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
<s> Do you dance?
<s> ... Don't explain.
<s> "To"... Forget about you.
<s> You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
<s> Not if you don't want me to.
<s> Just putting in an appearance then.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
<s> Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
<s> I think -- she's crazy.
<s> No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
<s> She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
<s> She bought it.
<s> Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
<s> He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
<s> I heard.
<s> I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
<s> It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
<s> Does it make you... hard?
<s> Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
<s> Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
<s> I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
<s> Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
<s> I know.  I've got one too.
<s> Get away from me, freak!
<s> Mr. Jameson--
<s> Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
<s> When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
<s> He knew.
<s> I hate people with alliterative names.
<s> Thank God.
<s> Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
<s> "Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
<s> Does it have a human name?
<s> Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
<s> Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
<s> Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
<s> Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
<s> Precise equipment such as waldos
<s> That's the understatement of the year.
<s> Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
<s> See?  You big dullard.
<s> Aunt May, what happened?
<s> Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
<s> Let's talk in the hall.
<s> Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
<s> Hi, Professor.  What's up?
<s> I'll try. Thanks.
<s> Imagine how I feel.
<s> And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
<s> Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
<s> Just drop me off here.
<s> Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
<s> I wouldn't talk about things like that.
<s> Plenty.
<s> Is you all little Adolfs?
<s> I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
<s> I don't know anymore.
<s> In this barracks?
<s> Yeah. Security.
<s> So long, Sefton.
<s> How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
<s> Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
<s> That's right.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I'll call the whole pot.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's on me.
<s> No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
<s> Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
<s> Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
<s> Why do you do this to me every morning?
<s> Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
<s> She'll never forgive me!
<s> Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
<s> This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
<s> Let me alone.
<s> Hey, Animal! Animal!
<s> One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
<s> You told them, Hoffy.
<s> You did!
<s> Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
<s> Give this to Joey, will you?
<s> Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
<s> Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
<s> What time?
<s> The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
<s> Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
<s> Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
<s> Who's the guy, Schulz?
<s> A chicken?
<s> Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
<s> Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
<s> Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
<s> He is.
<s> I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
<s> Full disruptors.
<s> It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
<s> It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
<s> That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
<s> I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
<s> Beam them directly to Sickbay.
<s> Please, please.
<s> No, no. Thank you.
<s> Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
<s> I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
<s> I thought you might.
<s> No, I didn't know that.
<s> Understood. That will be all.
<s> Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
<s> Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
<s> And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
<s> Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
<s> Nothing. As before.
<s> Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
<s> On screen.
<s> David... Sorry I'm late.
<s> ... Fascinating.
<s> We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
<s> David --
<s> Spock's burial robe.
<s> It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
<s> I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
<s> Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
<s> I'll try to remember that, Captain.
<s> Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
<s> I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
<s> Scan for vessels in pursuit!
<s> Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
<s> She's to be decommissioned.
<s> Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
<s> What about surface life signs...?
<s> Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
<s> That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
<s> Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
<s> Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
<s> Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
<s> 
<s> Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
<s> Yes...
<s> One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
<s> I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
<s> Understood, my lord.
<s> They outnumber us, my Lord --
<s> Steady. Continue on impulse power.
<s> 
<s> You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
<s> I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
<s> Thank you.
<s> Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
<s> I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
<s> Ah.
<s> Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
<s> At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
<s> He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
<s> This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
<s> Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
<s> I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
<s> I have my orders.
<s> I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
<s> Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
<s> And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
<s> Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
<s> Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
<s> What's the matter -- ?
<s> What do you want with us? I demand --
<s> There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
<s> Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
<s> I see. Helmsman?
<s> No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
<s> But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
<s> Is that what you came here to say?
<s> The Admiral's son.
<s> Let them eat static.
<s> Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
<s> Inoperative.
<s> Chekov, who is this man?
<s> Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
<s> I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
<s> Try the emergency channels...
<s> Scotty, let's have it.
<s> Admiral --
<s> Sensors, Captain?
<s> Give the word, Admiral.
<s> He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
<s> All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
<s> Not at present.
<s> Yes, SIR.
<s> 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
<s> Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
<s> Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
<s> Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
<s> At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
<s> Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
<s> Best speed, Scotty...
<s> Uhura, patch me in --
<s> He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
<s> The ship -- out of danger?
<s> Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
<s> Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
<s> You earned it.
<s> '... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> As you were, Mr. Saavik.
<s> <u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
<s> Try again.
<s> I'll try, Captain.
<s> Never, sir.
<s> Gillian --
<s> I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
<s> Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
<s> Cramps.
<s> ... My shoes...
<s> I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
<s> Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
<s> I liked him better before he died.
<s> That is what I said, Doctor.
<s> Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
<s> My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
<s> All right. Let's take it from the top.
<s> That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
<s> We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
<s> It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
<s> Go ahead.
<s> What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
<s> Implicitly.
<s> They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
<s> What do you mean now?
<s> What's what?
<s> No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
<s> That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
<s> ... You have a point...
<s> Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
<s> To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
<s> That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
<s> What is our target in time?
<s> What are the variables...?
<s> Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
<s> You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
<s> The hell I can't
<s> The tank will be finished by morning...
<s> Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
<s> Go, Mr. Sulu.
<s> Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
<s> Out of control, and blind as a bat!
<s> About 60 feet, Admiral.
<s> I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
<s> Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
<s> Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
<s> Mr. Sulu?
<s> Mr. Sulu, if you please.
<s> It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
<s> Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
<s> I demand to see the owners! I demand --
<s> Tell her I feel fine...
<s> Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
<s> Then you must spend your life answering questions.
<s> ... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
<s> You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
<s> ... an offlander?
<s> Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
<s> What's the rush?
<s> This way!
<s> Really?
<s> But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
<s> No one's ever asked me that before.
<s> Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
<s> It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
<s> Data doesn't breathe.
<s> The artificial lifeform was right?
<s> Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
<s> Is it safe to move her?
<s> Will the structure hold if we blast through?
<s> How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
<s> Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
<s> Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
<s> There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
<s> If we could lure him away from the bridge...
<s> Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
<s> Recommendations?
<s> So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
<s> The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
<s> How long 'til they reach us?
<s> We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
<s> So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
<s> You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
<s> Make it so.
<s> Picard to Crusher...
<s> Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
<s> Good question.
<s> Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
<s> Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
<s> I look forward to reading your report.
<s> Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
<s> How did Doctor Almack react to that?
<s> If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
<s> Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
<s> Bag him.
<s> Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
<s> And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
<s> According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
<s> Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
<s> I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
<s> Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
<s> Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
<s> We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
<s> This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
<s> Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
<s> As they used to say... all systems are go.
<s> Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
<s> I'm on it...
<s> We're crossing the threshold!
<s> I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
<s> It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
<s> You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
<s> Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Steady as she goes.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Onscreen.
<s> We're still in Earth orbit.
<s> I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
<s> Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
<s> What?
<s> We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
<s> They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
<s> Nothing.
<s> What are you suggesting?
<s> Riker here.
<s> Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
<s> There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
<s> What kind of message?
<s> Vulcans sleep lying down...
<s> We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
<s> Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
<s> We're not finished.
<s> Bones, are you afraid of the future?
<s> No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
<s> Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
<s> No way.  You see this?
<s> Come on...
<s> And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
<s> We were until your torpedoes!
<s> Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
<s> Barely.
<s> You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
<s> The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
<s> Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
<s> That isn't true...!
<s> Your honors, the State rests.
<s> Aye, sir; thrusters...
<s> Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
<s> She programmed the torpedo hits?
<s> Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
<s> Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
<s> Where do we come in?
<s> Captain, if --
<s> Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
<s> Right -
<s> You hear that?
<s> You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
<s> I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
<s> Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
<s> Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
<s> I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
<s> Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
<s> Not yet... Section 4236...
<s> Make ourselves a target?
<s> Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
<s> Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
<s> Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
<s> In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
<s> An error.
<s> You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
<s> We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
<s> You having hearing problems, mister?
<s> What is it?
<s> What exactly does that mean?
<s> Maybe we should write them a letter?
<s> You are me.
<s> Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
<s> But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
<s> It'll only work for one of us.
<s> Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
<s> Fire!
<s> Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
<s> He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
<s> It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
<s> The resemblance is... striking.
<s> I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
<s> Thank you.
<s> With pleasure, Captain.
<s> Do you have a moment, sir?
<s> How could I not?
<s> Do you have life support?
<s> What do we know about the planet?
<s> Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
<s> Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
<s> Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
<s> Understood.
<s> Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
<s> Aye, sir
<s> On screen.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Your new chair, sir.
<s> Still well on our side...
<s> Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
<s> Away team. Transporter room four.
<s> He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
<s> Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
<s> When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
<s> Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
<s> Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
<s> I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
<s> No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
<s> Yes.
<s> There is that.
<s> In time.
<s> Why am I here?
<s> I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
<s> You know that's not possible.
<s> On my way.
<s> Disruptors are off-line, sir.
<s> What about Picard?
<s> He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
<s> Find her again.
<s> They're holding position.
<s> Probably kids.
<s> Eh... yes.
<s> They must have picked it up in space.
<s> I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
<s> It's in a green Mustang?
<s> Okay...
<s> I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
<s> I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
<s> Don't... don't do this... please...
<s> Which way do you want to go?
<s> X...
<s> Smile.
<s> Gas good?
<s> Shit?
<s> Candy.
<s> A drink.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you have a baby?
<s> Why?
<s> Yes.
<s> Go?
<s> What?
<s> We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
<s> Yes?
<s> The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
<s> I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
<s> I do not want to.
<s> The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
<s> You're damn right I am.
<s> I understand.
<s> But...
<s> I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
<s> This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
<s> I must go.
<s> Call the police!!
<s> If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
<s> It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
<s> Sure.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
<s> Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
<s> Save us all a lot of trouble.
<s> You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
<s> Very beautiful country up here...
<s> It could have been anything.
<s> It was a man though... right?
<s> Judy, that's stupid.
<s> You know that's impossible!
<s> It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
<s> What's all this squid shit?
<s> Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> What're you going to do?
<s> Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
<s> No, Lenny.
<s> I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
<s> Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
<s> A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
<s> Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
<s> Shutup a second!
<s> You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
<s> Okay... what about Strickland?
<s> This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
<s> Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
<s> Who was just here?
<s> You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
<s> Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
<s> I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
<s> Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
<s> Yeah, but that was for love.
<s> Coming with you.
<s> Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
<s> She's my destiny.
<s> So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
<s> Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
<s> Sure.
<s> OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
<s> No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
<s> Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
<s> The gas tank's going to go any second!
<s> Fire's out, isn't it?
<s> Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
<s> Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
<s> And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
<s> Um... he was older.
<s> Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
<s> No, sir.
<s> What's the bad news?
<s> Winona.
<s> Not as much as you'd think.
<s> Hi. What's in the case?
<s> Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
<s> Whole country or just hereabouts?
<s> About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
<s> You know, you ever think about other women?
<s> Not bad, huh?
<s> What's wrong with me?
<s> Yes.
<s> I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
<s> What kind?
<s> Put a BOLO out on that.
<s> What about his killer?
<s> What's with the eyelids?
<s> What?
<s> They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
<s> Then why do I still have a badge?
<s> He got away. I had him. He got away.
<s> This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
<s> Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
<s> How long ago?
<s> We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
<s> I was visiting an old college friend.
<s> In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
<s> Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
<s> They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
<s> Not especially.
<s> Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
<s> That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
<s> The other reason?
<s> I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
<s> Sex.
<s> He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
<s> Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
<s> I know.
<s> You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
<s> No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
<s> You did.
<s> What's up?
<s> But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
<s> Koessler doesn't know any of this?
<s> They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
<s> But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
<s> How are we going to find him?
<s> Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
<s> I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
<s> I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
<s> I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
<s> The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
<s> You knew it was me all along?
<s> Maybe you should back off.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Whatever happened to MyDick?
<s> [Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
<s> Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
<s> Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
<s> Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
<s> Enough. I've got to use the phone.
<s> No. Stop, come on.
<s> Shut up.
<s> What do you drive?
<s> I thought real men don't like quiche.
<s> Tell me about it...
<s> What what? What advantages?
<s> No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
<s> ...and even then...
<s> ...then ask where you met her...
<s> I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
<s> No.
<s> ...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
<s> No matter what... like splitting aces.
<s> ...And she's with someone else.
<s> I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
<s> Could you believe it?
<s> Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
<s> There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
<s> Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
<s> Listen. I had a great time.
<s> ...Nah. I'm right across the street...
<s> ...The red piece of shit over there...
<s> Are you on the other line?
<s> Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
<s> Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
<s> I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
<s> Right.
<s> It sucks.
<s> Hey man, don't sweat it.
<s> Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
<s> You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
<s> Well, until now. Tend the pin.
<s> What'd you get?
<s> ...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
<s> You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
<s> Go for it, man.
<s> No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
<s> Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
<s> Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
<s> Give me the money. I'll get it.
<s> She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
<s> Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
<s> ...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
<s> Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
<s> 213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
<s> Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
<s> Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
<s> You're crazy.
<s> Just bring your card. Half an hour.
<s> Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
<s> Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
<s> Did she, or did she not smile?
<s> You think they're watching?
<s> You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
<s> What an asshole.
<s> That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
<s> I know she's coming back.
<s> Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
<s> It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
<s> Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
<s> Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
<s> I didn't even like her, to be honest.
<s> ...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
<s> Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
<s> It's on.
<s> We're not messing with you...
<s> Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
<s> ...It's on.
<s> True.
<s> ...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
<s> Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
<s> ...it's definitely on.
<s> You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
<s> I ask for Justice.
<s> Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
<s> What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
<s> So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
<s> Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
<s> It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
<s> I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
<s> I'll need him.
<s> Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
<s> And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
<s> You look good, too.
<s> Come here a minute, Fredo.
<s> That's for you to find out.
<s> The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
<s> No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
<s> And when they shot me father...
<s> Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
<s> I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
<s> You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
<s> You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
<s> Did he give you his politicians?
<s> How will they come at you?
<s> For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
<s> No.
<s> Oh Michael.
<s> Don't you want dinner first?
<s> Don't ask me.
<s> All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
<s> All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
<s> Cut it out.
<s> I do wish to be baptized.
<s> No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
<s> The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
<s> Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
<s> Sure. Any time.
<s> Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
<s> Yes please!
<s> Okay.
<s> Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
<s> That's funny.
<s> Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
<s> I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
<s> Your parents met her.
<s> I played piano in a few places.
<s> No, no brothers, no sisters.
<s> He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
<s> I'm prepared to take the blame.
<s> No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
<s> I love Marge.
<s> What evening?
<s> Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
<s> Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
<s> Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
<s> Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
<s> Frances?
<s> Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
<s> Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
<s> No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
<s> Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
<s> Dickie did it.
<s> Get on. I'll take you to him.
<s> Shut up! Shut up!
<s> Why do you have Dickie's rings?
<s> Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
<s> Do you know Tom?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Emily.  Just kidding.
<s> As in the...?
<s> And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
<s> He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
<s> Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
<s> They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
<s> Thanks.
<s> That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
<s> Just because he doesn't like Americans!
<s> Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
<s> Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
<s> No key, huh?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Was who Meredith?
<s> Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
<s> Even your fiance...?
<s> November 7th is my information.
<s> Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
<s> May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
<s> Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
<s> You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
<s> Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
<s> My name is Travis.
<s> I can believe that.
<s> Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
<s> He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
<s> I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
<s> Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
<s> No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
<s> I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
<s> He'll, what else can I do with it all?
<s> No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
<s> It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
<s> Keep it.
<s> The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
<s> I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
<s> You forgot "sexy".
<s> With who?
<s> Is he Italian?
<s> I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
<s> Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
<s> What did you do?
<s> And what happened?
<s> We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
<s> And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
<s> Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
<s> It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
<s> I can leave anytime I want.
<s> Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
<s> He looks like a killer.
<s> Me? I could never go to a place like that.
<s> Do I look like a narc?
<s> The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
<s> I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
<s> Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
<s> Yes.
<s> You want to work uptown nights?
<s> Physical? Criminal?
<s> Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
<s> Why?
<s> Your name Sport?
<s> I'm no cop.  I want some action.
<s> Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
<s> It happens.
<s> The taxi life, you mean.
<s> Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
<s> Neither do I, I guess.
<s> Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
<s> Don't let him do that.
<s> For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
<s> Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
<s> Partners.
<s> I'm not a fool, Billy.
<s> Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
<s> Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
<s> Okay.  What's the second thing?
<s> No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
<s> That always used to work.
<s> ... including me.  Right?  
<s> Well... where can we go?
<s> You must not remember anything. Come on.
<s> Yes.  Hic!
<s> What?
<s> It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
<s> You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
<s> Exactly.  And he got good.
<s> Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
<s> I do.
<s> I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
<s> By all means.
<s> Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
<s> The Bijou?
<s> Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
<s> Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
<s> Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
<s> They're...
<s> Oh, no, I...
<s> ... what?
<s> Sandra Sinclair.
<s> No, sir.
<s> I guess I did.
<s> It's possible.  I just don't remember.
<s> She's very pretty.
<s> We live in a theater?
<s> Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
<s> Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
<s> At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
<s> And I won't be a communist anymore.
<s> Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
<s> I taught you that.
<s> Oh.
<s> I thought you...
<s> What exactly did you hear?
<s> You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
<s> 'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
<s> My girlfriend.  If she still is...
<s> Yes?
<s> No. Just a few hours.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
<s> No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
<s> It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
<s> I despise it.
<s> I suspected as much.
<s> When was this?
<s> Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
<s> I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
<s> Then go.
<s> If your father were here...
<s> No!
<s> Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
<s> I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
<s> Shhh. Shhhhh.
<s> Yep.
<s> Right across the bay there.
<s> That's where the Brenners live.
<s> Mmmm.
<s> Okay.
<s> The little Brenner girl?
<s> Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
<s> Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
<s> Impossible.
<s> ...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
<s> Yes, very.
<s> No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
<s> I don't know when.  We'll see what...
<s> Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
<s> I started to say... inside...
<s> I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
<s> I don't mind, really.
<s> Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
<s> Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
<s> Yes.
<s> About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
<s> We met in court.
<s> I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
<s> Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
<s> Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
<s> Yes.
<s> Why would I want to see you, of all people?
<s> I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
<s> How does Mother know what I like to do?
<s> Oh. That. Rome.
<s> Yes.
<s> I told you what happened in Rome!
<s> Like what?
<s> Helping travelers.
<s> What about Thursdays and Fridays?
<s> Well, they'll go along with anything.
<s> ...everything I know.
<s> The bay doesn't.
<s> Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
<s> Inland.
<s> I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
<s> Well, all right, but...
<s> Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
<s> That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
<s> I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
<s> I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
<s> Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
<s> Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
<s> I'm not sure, but...
<s> Can we go on living here otherwise?
<s> Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
<s> Of course.
<s> Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
<s> Well? And are you not a good student?
<s> What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
<s> Gray killed her.
<s> I can't believe that.
<s> Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
<s> When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
<s> A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
<s> It was a woman when we put her in.
<s> Why, yes.
<s> Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
<s> Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
<s> That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
<s> Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
<s> That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
<s> But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
<s> Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
<s> You sent them. I had no choice.
<s> "Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
<s> I think we should get some support?
<s> I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
<s> Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
<s> What Scar? What fucking scar?
<s> Your father gave them to both of you.
<s> I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
<s> My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
<s> No! Why are you haunting me?
<s> ... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
<s> Yes I do, I really do.
<s> I don't know. I found him lying there.
<s> Yeah, we do.
<s> I know.
<s> Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
<s> You mean Alex.
<s> I do. Every day.
<s> Not tonight. Honest.
<s> This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
<s> That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
<s> It's not what you think.
<s> No.
<s> Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
<s> It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
<s> Yes -- that is true.
<s> Would you care to be more specific?
<s> I leave that in your hands.
<s> No -- not at all.
<s> I assure you such power exists.
<s> Yes.
<s> That can easily be arranged.
<s> Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
<s> Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
<s> No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
<s> Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
<s> Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
<s> I mean the reasons for my coming here.
<s> We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
<s> I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
<s> Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
<s> Thank you... Have you any news?
<s> There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
<s> Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
<s> Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
<s> Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
<s> Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
<s> Where is the meeting going to be?
<s> That's right.
<s> They would have killed this man?
<s> Time to activate Plan B.
<s> The Prince of Darkness.
<s> El Vampiro.
<s> Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
<s> The meanest!
<s> You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
<s> You're almost one of us now, Michael.
<s> I will, David!
<s> Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
<s> How do you know they're not?
<s> If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
<s> I told Max eight o'clock.
<s> You have a T.V.?
<s> Lots more where he came from.
<s> Who, Laddie?
<s> He's just a deep sleeper.
<s> Oh, no, you won't.
<s> I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
<s> I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
<s> Michael!...
<s> In here?
<s> But, Mom...
<s> Mom!
<s> I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
<s> Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
<s> It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
<s> Michael's great.  I like Michael.
<s> Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
<s> I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
<s> Because I love you...
<s> So do I!
<s> What would that make Mom?
<s> No.  Why?
<s> Don't bother.
<s> Nanook...
<s> Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
<s> What about Mom?
<s> Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
<s> Let's load 'em.
<s> Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<s> I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
<s> So what's our problem?
<s> I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
<s> Finish what?
<s> ... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
<s> Let go of me...
<s> Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
<s> That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
<s> I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
<s> You buy any of this, Blair?
<s> ... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
<s> We ain't buying that.
<s> The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
<s> They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
<s> All in Norwegian.
<s> Nothing we can do about that.
<s> Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
<s> What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
<s> Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
<s> He's dead.
<s> Can you think of any other tests?
<s> Everything that's been missing.
<s> What for?
<s> MacReady, that you?
<s> Can't hear you.
<s> Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
<s> It frightens you.
<s> Yes.
<s> End...?
<s> Alexander.
<s> How do you control the Morlocks?
<s> A man can change his history.
<s> Oh, you won't be running for long...
<s> Got here as soon as I could.
<s> What?
<s> I need to... um... talk to you.
<s> Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
<s> I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
<s> Do you know you were humming?
<s> Tonight's the night?
<s> You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
<s> For God's Sake, David --
<s> That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
<s> I live with it every minute of every day.
<s> Why don't you come to our house instead?
<s> I'm glad.
<s> Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
<s> You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
<s> I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
<s> Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
<s> Why not?
<s> I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
<s> Learning was important?
<s> You know this?
<s> So you can use it now?
<s> Mara --
<s> My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
<s> Tell him to go away --
<s> Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
<s> New Yorkers.
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
<s> Dean Fulton...
<s> Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
<s> Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
<s> We never should have done this to him...
<s> Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
<s> Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
<s> Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
<s> Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
<s> What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
<s> Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
<s> [Beat] What?
<s> It's December 25th, 1993 today.
<s> There're no cars on this street.
<s> William, you're not making sense.
<s> Then, where are you going?
<s> So it's helping?
<s> I never knew my father. Did you?
<s> Well, what time is it?
<s> It doesn't look all that different.
<s> I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Because I don't have time.
<s> You still don't believe me, do you?
<s> Listen to me. That's all I ask.
<s> Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
<s> I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
<s> You don't have anywhere to stay?
<s> What?!
<s> I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
<s> Umm, yes.  She was driving.
<s> You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
<s> If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
<s> A .38.
<s> Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
<s> It's okay.  I'm married, too.
<s> Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
<s> Thelma?  It's me.
<s> Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
<s> Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
<s> You're a little angle, you are.
<s> Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
<s> Christ, sure... yes!
<s> Can't it go to any office?
<s> No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
<s> I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
<s> You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
<s> I don't know how to fish, Louise.
<s> It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
<s> We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
<s> Isn't this fun?
<s> Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
<s> I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
<s> In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
<s> West.  Left.
<s> I don't know.  I won't be.
<s> I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
<s> She thinks he's a pig.
<s> I won't wait up.
<s> Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
<s> Yes!  I believe I am!
<s> Yeah.
<s> What for?
<s> Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
<s> I... I...
<s> Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
<s> I can see that.
<s> Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
<s> Thelma!
<s> Okay, Louise... It's okay.
<s> Yeah, you want it?
<s> You know why.  You already said.
<s> Yes, Thelma?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
<s> Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
<s> Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
<s> Good.
<s> Yup.
<s> How do you stay so positive?
<s> What are you talkin' about?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Hi there!  You alright?
<s> Fresno.
<s> Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
<s> What?
<s> The thing's kind of heavy.
<s> You sent that?
<s> Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
<s> Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
<s> He implied it.
<s> Yeah, but he was successful.
<s> Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
<s> I told you, her family moved to Miami.
<s> I don't know.
<s> That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
<s> Jesus Christ you're right.
<s> 'That right?
<s> I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
<s> No I can't.
<s> Dumbshit.
<s> Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Nepal? Have you been?
<s> I already know it, Mary.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
<s> Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
<s> Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
<s> -- Love story of our time.
<s> Wow. I thought I was the only one.
<s> Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
<s> Well, I'll see ya.
<s> Well, I know you're busy...
<s> No.
<s> So you found Mary?
<s> I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
<s> Oh my.
<s> She's in a wheelchair?!
<s> I said buttplug. She's heinous.
<s> Surprised?
<s> Do what?
<s> What?
<s> Same here.
<s> You mean him.
<s> Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
<s> Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
<s> How'd you manage that one?
<s> Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
<s> Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
<s> Hm?
<s> Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
<s> Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
<s> That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
<s> This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
<s> Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
<s> Where would I have seen your work?
<s> Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
<s> No no no, Tucker, thank you.
<s> Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
<s> No, it's an old football injury.
<s> A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
<s> Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
<s> Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
<s> Oh great, I ran out.
<s> What are you?
<s> All right, let's go.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Toy poodle!
<s> Okay.
<s> You forgot your keys!
<s> Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
<s> Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
<s> I wish.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
<s> Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
<s> See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
<s> Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
<s> I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
<s> What --
<s> Where the hell are you?
<s> -- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
<s> This is from the Highest Authority?
<s> And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
<s> Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
<s> We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
<s> Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
<s> Kids are supposed to get detention.
<s> I'll be evacuated with the President.
<s> Yeah.
<s> There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
<s> Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
<s> Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
<s> Okay, Ken. We're going.
<s> Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
<s> Just a second, Mr. President.
<s> Rug samples.
<s> I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
<s> Who the fuck is he?
<s> Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
<s> One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
<s> Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
<s> Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
<s> Let's see it.
<s> Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
<s> All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
<s> She's that subtle?
<s> The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
<s> You're steppin' on sign.
<s> Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Medicine. As in medicine man?
<s> Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
<s> Why should I tell you.
<s> The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
<s> He also said "listen to the water."
<s> What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
<s> Likewise.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
<s> We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
<s> Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
<s> Move it, Magdelana.
<s> -- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
<s> Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
<s> Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
<s> No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
<s> I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
<s> I'm with someone.
<s> Yeow!
<s> Where were you?
<s> Two miles.
<s> You let me make a fool of myself.
<s> I thought there was something... That night in the club...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
<s> What plane.
<s> I'm starting to sense that now.
<s> Winston Churchill.
<s> All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
<s> Are you really that brave?
<s> Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
<s> . Yeah!
<s> What?
<s> What do you want?
<s> What truth?
<s> True.
<s> Take something off.
<s> Well what?
<s> Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
<s> He better be kidding!
<s> These guys are getting on my nerves.
<s> Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
<s> You go. I'm staying with it.
<s> But I have to!
<s> Well what?
<s> What do I want?
<s> Any more MiGs?
<s> So's my Johnson.
<s> Who's your pilot?
<s> Could use a dash more jet fuel.
<s> Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
<s> Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
<s> Come on, relax...
<s> No shit! That why they call him Ice?
<s> What'd you do?
<s> That's because you don't have any women.
<s> No. You can be mine!
<s> Just below ten thousand.
<s> So have I.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
<s> I lost.
<s> I know.
<s> He was by the book, all the way.
<s> Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
<s> The Last Resort.
<s> Take me to the hotel.
<s> Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
<s> Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Don't be an idiot.
<s> What is it?
<s> Looks like another schizoid embolism.
<s> Come on...put his head in place.
<s> I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
<s> Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
<s> How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
<s> Arrest that woman!
<s> O.K., everybody pull out!
<s> Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
<s> A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
<s> Let me buy you a drink.
<s> Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
<s> Up to the right.
<s> How did I get in this taxi?!
<s> The brunette.  The one you told me about.
<s> Bye.
<s> How real does it seem?
<s> Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
<s> What's he talking about?
<s> Blondes.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Hauser left me a note.
<s> I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
<s> He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
<s> Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
<s> Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
<s> All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
<s> Aliens built it.
<s> Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
<s> Enough for everybody to breathe?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
<s> In a minute.
<s> I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
<s> Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
<s> No.  We go straight.
<s> You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
<s> Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
<s> Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
<s> You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
<s> One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
<s> He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
<s> If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
<s> That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
<s> You got <u>that</u> right!
<s> Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
<s> We got a plan!
<s> Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
<s> So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
<s> I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
<s> Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
<s> What?
<s> We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
<s> Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
<s> You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
<s> You guys do all the odd jobs.
<s> And one good guy.
<s> Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
<s> It most certainly is.
<s> Sustained.
<s> I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
<s> Shut your sewer mouth!
<s> Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
<s> Right. You're right.
<s> Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
<s> Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
<s> Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
<s> -- The Nazi he knifed?
<s> We're taking the other case.
<s> Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
<s> Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
<s> A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
<s> 1530 Rivington Street.
<s> ...What do you mean?
<s> But what?
<s> That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
<s> I've seen this picture before.
<s> Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
<s> ... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
<s> ...For ten years, now.
<s> "...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
<s> Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
<s> Exactly what happened then?
<s> I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
<s> Maybe... because someone's afraid.
<s> When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
<s> Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
<s> Y-yes, sir.
<s> No, s-sir.
<s> Don Reynard.
<s> Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
<s> I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
<s> That's right.
<s> Argumentative.
<s> Calls for speculation.
<s> Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
<s> I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
<s> -- Roger --
<s> Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
<s> A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
<s> No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
<s> She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
<s> I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
<s> What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
<s> That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
<s> Was there an argument?
<s> Smell something fishy, huh?
<s> Stanley, I heard all about it.
<s> No, sir, we did not.
<s> You are here and there is no place to go...
<s> Where's Hap?
<s> Did she ever mention any friends?
<s> Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
<s> Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
<s> Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
<s> Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
<s> Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
<s> It's late, Sam.
<s> I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
<s> Faulty wiring.
<s> Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
<s> Maybe.
<s> Well, why not?
<s> Donna, you are a muffin.
<s> Nothing.
<s> But Bob isn't real.
<s> What does Bob say?
<s> I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
<s> I am The Muffin.
<s> What? She asked about my father?
<s> That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
<s> I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
<s> Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
<s> It's a school night... back by nine.
<s> Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
<s> Not really.
<s> No.
<s> This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
<s> How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
<s> Who am I?
<s> There's no one here.
<s> She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
<s> As far as we know, nothing.
<s> Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
<s> Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
<s> How did you settle on the amount?
<s> That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
<s> Gruber...
<s> To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
<s> What does it mean?
<s> I...
<s> 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
<s> You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
<s> You've just said you signed it.
<s> Just as you are, Sir...
<s> No.
<s> I'm on the staff of...
<s> Frank Galvin. We've met before.
<s> ...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
<s> And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> What did these people do when her heart stopped?
<s> My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
<s> I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
<s> Yes... I... yes.
<s> No. No. Thank you. You go home.
<s> ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
<s> Why?
<s> Hi. How are you doing?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
<s> You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
<s> What?
<s> If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
<s> I changed my room at the Hotel.
<s> Yes. It was, actually.
<s> And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
<s> What...?
<s> They, uh, they got to my witness.
<s> You're talking like a drunk.
<s> I... do you want me to leave?
<s> What is that to you...?
<s> I have to talk to you.
<s> My subscription lapsed three years ago...
<s> ...I'm sure you do...
<s> ...I understand...
<s> ...I understand...
<s> We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
<s> Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
<s> ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
<s> ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Don't touch anything.
<s> ...I'm going to need your help...
<s> I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
<s> We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
<s> I can't talk now.
<s> Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
<s> Yeah.
<s> All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
<s> The 'History'...?
<s> We got to talk.
<s> I don't want a mistrial.
<s> I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
<s> Yes, that's correct.
<s> Yes.
<s> ...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
<s> There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
<s> He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
<s> How can you say that when you don't know him!
<s> Would you like some coffee, General?
<s> No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
<s> I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
<s> It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
<s> But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
<s> I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
<s> It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
<s> You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
<s> How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
<s> I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
<s> It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
<s> Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
<s> So is the town, I notice!
<s> Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
<s> We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
<s> He's very excited about it.
<s> Chase...
<s> Heather, has there been another call?
<s> No...
<s> Absolutely.
<s> He was just here!
<s> Everything is not fine!
<s> Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
<s> Home, that's right.
<s> A story?
<s> Read me some?
<s> I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
<s> Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
<s> Steady...
<s> Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
<s> Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
<s> Yes?
<s> Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
<s> Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
<s> And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
<s> Not yet.
<s> It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
<s> I am about this.
<s> I haven't forgotten.
<s> Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
<s> Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
<s> My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
<s> That's what they get for not locking the door.
<s> If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
<s> What?
<s> I know.
<s> That's not why he's sending me.
<s> It was a bad dream...
<s> What's the difference?
<s> Forget it.
<s> I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
<s> He killed the dolphin.
<s> Of what?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Your cannons made a compelling argument.
<s> As you can see, there's a lot to do.
<s> I should be eating with the crew.
<s> Why are you here?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> You're officer of the watch, George.
<s> We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
<s> Come on, he didn't mean anything.
<s> What is it... the secret?
<s> What?
<s> No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
<s> Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
<s> Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
<s> Son of a bitch!!
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> I can't.
<s> You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
<s> Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
<s> I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
<s> How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
<s> Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
<s> I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
<s> Yessir.
<s> How old are you?
<s> You an indian?
<s> Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
<s> I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
<s> Forty bucks...
<s> Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
<s> Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
<s> Used to.
<s> Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
<s> No sir...
<s> I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
<s> Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
<s> Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
<s> Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
<s> Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
<s> I couldn't say, which one?
<s> This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
<s> The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
<s> Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
<s> Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
<s> Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
<s> See ya downstairs.
<s> You ain't actin', mama.
<s> Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
<s> 'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
<s> Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
<s> I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
<s> That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
<s> Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
<s> It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
<s> She got me an abortion...
<s> Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
<s> We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
<s> Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
<s> Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
<s> Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
<s> Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
<s> What kinda trash talk is that?
<s> Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
<s> Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
<s> Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
<s> We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
<s> Gotta hex from a voodoo?
<s> You do.
<s> Who knows, baby?
<s> Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
<s> Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
<s> It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
<s> That'd be good, Lula.
<s> I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
<s> No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
<s> What's that?
<s> One bad car accident...
<s> I'm afraid she is, baby.
<s> No radio or TV...
<s> Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'll come along.
<s> I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
<s> Oughta make 'em happy.
<s> Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
<s> He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
<s> Damn!
<s> Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
<s> You ain't takin' Pace, though.
<s> Shoot him.
<s> Yes.
<s> In the head.
<s> Yes.
<s> Santos... No... Please, Santos...
<s> No...
<s> Whattya mean?
<s> You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
<s> Life is unpredictable.
<s> Well?...
<s> That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
<s> Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
<s> The candelabras were my Gran's.
<s> How are you, Crabtree?
<s> I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
<s> I know. He started it Fall semester.
<s> Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
<s> He heard everything we were saying.
<s> Shit.
<s> Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
<s> Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
<s> Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
<s> What's to tell?
<s> The Chancellor's here? Now?
<s> Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
<s> First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
<s> Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
<s> I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
<s> And your wife left you.
<s> So is my friend... is Sara still here?
<s> Shoot.
<s> Stop calling me Vernon.
<s> ...You carry firearms.
<s> No! What gave you that idea?
<s> She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
<s> It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
<s> Heaven?
<s> I'll miss my bus.
<s> So I'm told.
<s> Like the lady herself.
<s> I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
<s> Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
<s> You?
<s> That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
<s> Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
<s> Well done, James.
<s> But James. I mean... How long?
<s> Hm.
<s> Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
<s> Jesus, James. Wow.
<s> I never heard of it.
<s> James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
<s> The hell I am.
<s> I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
<s> I thank you.
<s> I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
<s> No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
<s> I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
<s> No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
<s> Is the thing -- is it over?
<s> No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
<s> It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
<s> Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
<s> About the baby.
<s> I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
<s> Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
<s> Dozens. It's very sad.
<s> Some times...
<s> James is... I don't know...
<s> Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
<s> GRADY Tripp. English Department.
<s> I... I...
<s> I don't know. It might be...
<s> Sick.
<s> A jockey? You mean, like --
<s> I might have his number on campus.
<s> No, I'm going ho --
<s> Just a few then. The big ones.
<s> I haven't heard of half of those.
<s> I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
<s> I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Next week? The week after?
<s> Isn't it?
<s> Sure.
<s> Is that right?
<s> The mother sure has her hands full.
<s> That was terrific.
<s> You live around here?
<s> Why don't you just tell me?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> I count my blessings.
<s> I'm adjusting okay.
<s> Apartment's okay.
<s> What?
<s> How come?
<s> Ms. Kramer.
<s> Yes?
<s> That was a joke.
<s> What?
<s> Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
<s> I'm not that crazy.
<s> Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
<s> We have a lot of work to do.
<s> I'm afraid not.
<s> I don't.
<s> Is this the first one?
<s> I'm relaxed.
<s> In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
<s> Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
<s> Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
<s> Yes.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Me?
<s> I'm just quiet.
<s> I'll buy a plant.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What?
<s> Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
<s> You think I have a problem?
<s> It's been a while since...
<s> No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
<s> Why young girls, Walter?
<s> What?
<s> I know.
<s> What odds?
<s> I'm not scared.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not when they fly.
<s> Piece of cake, baby.
<s> How deep's the drop-off here?
<s> Not for long.
<s> I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
<s> No.
<s> How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
<s> They'll come out after us.
<s> Calm down, Bud.
<s> Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
<s> Let's go, guys.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
<s> You watch yourself.
<s> Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
<s> Turn it up, bozo.
<s> Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
<s> That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
<s> You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
<s> We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
<s> That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
<s> Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
<s> Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
<s> But you just said that a month was too...
<s> This one is gorgeous.
<s> To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
<s> It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
<s> I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
<s> And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
<s> Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
<s> More so than the shark?
<s> But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
<s> How should I be ... arrogant?
<s> And why haven't they left each other?
<s> Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
<s> And how do you explain that?
<s> Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
<s> Occasionally, but always with affection.
<s> I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
<s> Are you joking?
<s> But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
<s> I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
<s> Why?
<s> Good night. Tell me that you love me.
<s> I deserve it.
<s> I would say he's pretty depraved.
<s> One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
<s> Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
<s> You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
<s> But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
<s> To the shark.
<s> I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
<s> There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
<s> It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
<s> Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
<s> And where do you find the models?
<s> Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
<s> And do you remember where she got off?
<s> No. The owners are in Australia.
<s> At this time of the year there are so many boats...
<s> Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
<s> I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
<s> Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
<s> Is that far from here?
<s> Why?
<s> ... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
<s> Agnes...
<s> Who tells you these things?
<s> That's not what he meant.
<s> Dear Jesus...
<s> I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
<s> I love you.
<s> No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Where?
<s> And what did you do?
<s> And then what?
<s> Martha Louise Livingston.
<s> She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
<s> No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
<s> I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
<s> She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
<s> No.
<s> No, but I can never tell her that.
<s> A mistake...
<s> Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
<s> I breathed!
<s> She...
<s> She says my whole body's a mistake.
<s> And then...
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> No I'm not.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes I am.
<s> Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
<s> As much as Mother Miriam does?
<s> No.
<s> It grew.
<s> Are you ill?
<s> What do you do?
<s> I don't know which one 
<s> Yes.
<s> Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
<s> What?
<s> Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
<s> You got to be crazy.
<s> Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
<s> Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
<s> Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
<s> I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
<s> We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
<s> Obviously there was.
<s> Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
<s> What's your opinion?
<s> From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
<s> And in your eyes?
<s> When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
<s> What?
<s> I hate ignorance and stupidity.
<s> I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
<s> And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
<s> I don't think I care to know.
<s> The woman's health is at stake.
<s> You just said...
<s> And what has that to do with it?
<s> There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
<s> Become?  One is born a saint.
<s> Listen to her singing.
<s> If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
<s> I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
<s> I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
<s> Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
<s> We'd be thrown out.
<s> Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
<s> Bet you're only eight and a half.
<s> Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
<s> Shurrup!
<s> All right, take your hoop and bowl.
<s> No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
<s> Now what's that supposed to mean?
<s> Wake up!
<s> We do.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Follow your impulse.
<s> I've got you worried, haven't I?
<s> Something like that.
<s> Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
<s> Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
<s> And cunning.
<s> Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
<s> Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
<s> Yeah ... what's in it for me?
<s> Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
<s> Nothing good.
<s> Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
<s> I'll look after meself.
<s> Why do you always use your left hand?
<s> We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
<s> What little old man?
<s> Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
<s> Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
<s> You needn't bother.
<s> Ah, go on, you swine.
<s> Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
<s> Sit down, the lot of you.
<s> Tonight? We can't make it ...
<s> I would have said so.
<s> What have you heard?
<s> Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
<s> Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
<s> And they want me?
<s> Get knotted!
<s> Oh, anything you say, Paul.
<s> Yeah, it's you all right.
<s> Kill drive engines.
<s> Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
<s> Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
<s> Yeah.  Two hours.
<s> I'll see what I can do.
<s> Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
<s> Receiving.
<s> Looks like a derelict.
<s> Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
<s> Wretched.  What happened to me?
<s> I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
<s> <u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
<s> Yeah!
<s> What?
<s> We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
<s> Dead.
<s> Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
<s> Damn it!  How long to fix?
<s> Right.
<s> Here, let me try.
<s> I hope not.
<s> All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
<s> Right. 
<s> I'll come with you.
<s> How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
<s> Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
<s> How's Broussard?
<s> How do we locate the creature?
<s> Sounds like a rough one.
<s> At least it can't get up here now.
<s> It's time for drastic remedies.
<s> How many?
<s> What is it -- I can't tell anything --
<s> Oh... God...
<s> It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
<s> We sure need this flamethrower.
<s> Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
<s> Feast your eyes.
<s> What is it?
<s> Is it still dripping?
<s> We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
<s> Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
<s> No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
<s> Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
<s> Anything else?
<s> I don't even know what I'm looking for.
<s> Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
<s> Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
<s> Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
<s> If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
<s> We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
<s> Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
<s> Go ahead, Jay.
<s> Let's be democratic.
<s> At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
<s> Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
<s> What did it do to you?
<s> I'll get you out of there.
<s> But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
<s> Yep...
<s> We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
<s> What's happening?
<s> And?
<s> Nooooo!
<s> Has anybody talked to them?
<s> Do it.
<s> Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Auto-shop?
<s> Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
<s> Compensate!
<s> What?  Why?
<s> We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
<s> How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
<s> Real man' drink.
<s> Want some?
<s> 'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
<s> Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
<s> Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
<s> Don't wait for me!
<s> Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
<s> Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
<s> I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
<s> You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
<s> I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
<s> I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
<s> And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
<s> All paved with diamonds and gold?
<s> That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
<s> Lloyd and I.
<s> Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
<s> Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
<s> Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
<s> You can have one at Max's.
<s> It's the same thing, isn't it?
<s> Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
<s> That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
<s> Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
<s> What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
<s> Margo.
<s> Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
<s> Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
<s> I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
<s> How nice.
<s> We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
<s> Thank you so much.
<s> Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
<s> Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
<s> As of this moment you're six years old...
<s> Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
<s> A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
<s> Sing it?
<s> And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
<s> The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
<s> I get a party, don't I?
<s> She's a girl of so many interests.
<s> Nothing, really...
<s> If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
<s> So full of meaning, fire and music!
<s> I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
<s> Don't mix your metaphors.
<s> You've been all through that with Lloyd-
<s> I'll say.
<s> Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
<s> But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
<s> He does not exaggerate. I was good.
<s> You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
<s> Groom.
<s> A married lady.
<s> I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
<s> Why you have to go out there.
<s> It's only one picture deal.
<s> What did you expect - live sables?
<s> You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
<s> Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
<s> Miss Harrington...
<s> You were just looking around...
<s> What for?
<s> I'll just pick up the broken glass.
<s> Subway.
<s> You rest. I'll get it...
<s> I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
<s> My husband...
<s> Hollywood.
<s> But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
<s> If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
<s> - and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
<s> - and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
<s> He's not my friend. You were my friends...
<s> I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
<s> If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
<s> How do you do, Mr. Richards.
<s> 'Remembrance'.
<s> I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
<s> Well, you've done so much... what's new?
<s> Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
<s> Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
<s> I wouldn't like.
<s> I had no idea you knew each other.
<s> What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
<s> They're your fans, your audience-
<s> Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
<s> I just can't believe it.
<s> Well... all right.
<s> Check.
<s> It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
<s> - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
<s> Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
<s> Such as?
<s> What are you going to wear?
<s> Nothing...
<s> I'm a human being, I've got some!
<s> That was way back...
<s> And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
<s> She was a revelation...
<s> Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
<s> Too bad.
<s> Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
<s> But what could she do?
<s> Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
<s> Answer my question!
<s> Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
<s> --they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
<s> It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
<s> The fucking New York Times.
<s> Why didn't we get that?
<s> I never scared anyone before.
<s> Nixon.
<s> Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
<s> That happens to people.  OK, go on.
<s> You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
<s> --Haldeman I know, who else?
<s> So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
<s> If he self-destructed.
<s> --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
<s> --We got twenty minutes to deadline--
<s> Only everything...
<s> Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
<s> And you will.  But not now.
<s> I know where Dwight works.
<s> --so?
<s> We've just been talking to Young--
<s> --Deep Throat?--
<s> --there's nothing new in it--
<s> There's always a later plane.
<s> I don't know what they'd do to me.
<s> We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
<s> I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
<s> Which people?
<s> Who were they?
<s> 'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
<s> A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
<s> Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
<s> --let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
<s> --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
<s> You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
<s> Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
<s> Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
<s> --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
<s> I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
<s> Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
<s> Ratfucking.
<s> The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
<s> Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
<s> Haldeman too?
<s> Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
<s> --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
<s> Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
<s> Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
<s> Government. Recently retired.
<s> ...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
<s> It is.
<s> Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
<s> I did all right on McCord.
<s> The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
<s> Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
<s> I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
<s> Could develop.
<s> --remember Toronto, Harry.
<s> --Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
<s> Absolutely.
<s> --well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
<s> My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
<s> One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
<s> -- Thanks, coach --
<s> ...okay...
<s> When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
<s> Neither did I!
<s> Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
<s> Charming.
<s> So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
<s> You can call me Oz.
<s> Forget it.
<s> That's nice.
<s> Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
<s> Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
<s> Sure.
<s> You can't sing at the competition.
<s> No.  I'm missing the game for you.
<s> Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
<s> Sure.
<s> No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
<s> No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
<s> Pontificated.
<s> Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
<s> Just in time.
<s> Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
<s> Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
<s> It's not what it looks like!
<s> That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
<s> I know.  Hey Nadia.
<s> Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
<s> Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
<s> Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
<s> Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
<s> What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
<s> Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
<s> Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
<s> Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
<s> You've got something going?
<s> Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
<s> No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
<s> God dammit, Stifler!
<s> You think so?
<s> Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
<s> Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
<s> I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
<s> I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
<s> So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
<s> What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
<s> What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
<s> You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
<s> <u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
<s> Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> Yep.
<s> No way.
<s> I'd use pills. They're painless.
<s> Uhh! Would you die already!
<s> Just like sex with my wife.
<s> What?
<s> Serafine...?
<s> It's okay. I can see fine.
<s> Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
<s> Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
<s> I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
<s> I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
<s> I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
<s> What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
<s> Really.
<s> Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
<s> You on drugs? Huh?
<s> Shit!
<s> Oh no... no....
<s> What about me?
<s> You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
<s> What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
<s> The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
<s> AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
<s> I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
<s> How well did, er, do you know him?
<s> No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
<s> God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
<s> He says -
<s> Double merde.
<s> What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
<s> Get on! Anastasia, get on!
<s> Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Come out! I can do alterations.
<s> I shant!
<s> Yes, your highness.
<s> I have my reasons.
<s> Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
<s> Trying... to... breathe...
<s> Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
<s> It's the best fork of all
<s> It's not you - it's the dress!
<s> I'll never let go!
<s> Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
<s> Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
<s> That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
<s> Ew. . .  the honest type.
<s> Pray he's color-blind...
<s> Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
<s> Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
<s> Alvy Singer over here!
<s> I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
<s> Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
<s> Well, why not?
<s> Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
<s> No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
<s> Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
<s> That movie makes me feel guilty.
<s> Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
<s> Me? Oh, downtown!
<s> Well, I do commercials, sort of...
<s> Wisconsin.
<s> Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
<s> Nice car.
<s> You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
<s> Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
<s> Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
<s> That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
<s> Yeah.
<s> Good? I was-
<s> No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
<s> M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
<s> H'm?
<s> You are extremely sexy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
<s> Mine.
<s> M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
<s> Let's just do it, all right?
<s> so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
<s> Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
<s> It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
<s> David? You call your teacher David?
<s> M'm.
<s> Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
<s> Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
<s> No.
<s> I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
<s> Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
<s> Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
<s> I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
<s> Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
<s> What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
<s> Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
<s> Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
<s> Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
<s> No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
<s> I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
<s> I thought just earplugs.
<s> Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
<s> Don't get upset!
<s> I can't.
<s> You have a raccoon?
<s> The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
<s> What are you depressed about?
<s> It's a narrow view.
<s> I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
<s> Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
<s> Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
<s> Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
<s> Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
<s> Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
<s> SO?
<s> She was going through my pocketbook!
<s> How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
<s> Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
<s> ...of possibly working together.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It was a wonderful set.
<s> I don't know. I don't know.
<s> It's the way they do things.
<s> Would it make a difference?
<s> The camera loves her.  A great actress.
<s> It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
<s> How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
<s> Of course.
<s> To dander.  Otis.
<s> Didn't I say?
<s> Really.
<s> I love her too, Joe.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
<s> Count on it.
<s> You really need to be fucked.
<s> She's in ICU.
<s> You have to sign your taxes anyway.
<s> Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
<s> We couldn't be on more solid ground.
<s> That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
<s> Just do what I say, alright?
<s> Beats a lawsuit.
<s> I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
<s> No.  I missed that.
<s> Really?
<s> Truce?
<s> It's ecstasy, Sal.
<s> I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
<s> Otis!
<s> Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
<s> Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
<s> Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
<s> I'll be with you.
<s> Me too.
<s> It's a Calder.
<s> Oh, you know, I am.
<s> Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
<s> But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
<s> And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
<s> It's Jerry's worst idea.
<s> Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
<s> Oh.  You're serious.
<s> In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
<s> Oh.
<s> And you know, he really does not.
<s> And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
<s> I will treasure this.
<s> A lot of cakes.
<s> Time!
<s> Well...wow...
<s> Let's just go home, okay?
<s> You fucking cow, can't you read?!
<s> How long ago was it?
<s> Not at all.
<s> Yes.
<s> Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
<s> Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
<s> Like your business managers?
<s> It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
<s> Yes.  Fine.
<s> No.  Not something new.
<s> Thanks.
<s> At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
<s> Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
<s> I'll be right out.
<s> Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
<s> I don't mind...
<s> Evie has a little something for you.
<s> A notch above the storage room.
<s> She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
<s> Oh Soph...
<s> And the food sucks, I know.
<s> Neither does Joe.
<s> Not nice.  Not kind.
<s> Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
<s> Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
<s> It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
<s> Quiet -- sshhh!!
<s> Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
<s> Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
<s> No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
<s> Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
<s> <u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
<s> And do Princesses do improper things?
<s> You did?
<s> Yes...he's wonderful...
<s> Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
<s> Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
<s> Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
<s> Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
<s> I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
<s> Ant Team Six...
<s> Oh, no, sir!
<s> Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
<s> Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
<s> And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
<s> I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
<s> Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
<s> Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
<s> Morning, Miss Kubelik.
<s> I should have stayed in bed last night.
<s> I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
<s> Just tell 'em -- now and then.
<s> What time does the show go on?
<s> So I see.
<s> Oh.
<s> Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
<s> How many of those drinks did you have?
<s> Of course not.
<s> Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
<s> Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
<s> What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
<s> Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
<s> In his apartment.
<s> Miss. 
<s> As soon as I can walk.
<s> They had to pump it out.
<s> He doesn't give a damn about me.
<s> That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
<s> Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
<s> Can I have that pad and the pencil?
<s> Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
<s> Are you supposed to?
<s> I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
<s> As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
<s> A what?
<s> I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Where?
<s> No -- just come as you are.
<s> Cheers.
<s> The dishes?
<s> I don't?
<s> Oh.
<s> You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
<s> What for?
<s> Gas?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Mr. Dobisch said that?
<s> I don't know.
<s> In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
<s> West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
<s> Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
<s> Swap them? For what?
<s> Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
<s> Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
<s> Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
<s> And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
<s> That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
<s> Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
<s> You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
<s> What do you mean, sorry?
<s> No I didn't.
<s> That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
<s> Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> What does he mean, accident?
<s> Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
<s> Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
<s> So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
<s> What do you want?
<s> What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
<s> No!
<s> Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
<s> I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
<s> I have a vague idea.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Let me get my bag.
<s> Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
<s> Happy New Year.
<s> You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
<s> No.
<s> Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
<s> She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
<s> Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
<s> This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
<s> Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
<s> Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
<s> It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
<s> Six weeks. But who's counting?
<s> -- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
<s> Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
<s> For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
<s> Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
<s> We didn't talk about it -- you did.
<s> Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
<s> I wasn't trying.
<s> You know I do.
<s> Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
<s> Stop that, Fran.
<s> The nerve.
<s> I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
<s> Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
<s> Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
<s> Lovely. You were a big help.
<s> Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> Oh -- oh!
<s> What's it matter? Get to the point.
<s> Dreadful.
<s> We have a lot of pride in our unit --
<s> Moonby. Got any Winstons?
<s> You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
<s> We do.
<s> I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
<s> Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
<s> That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
<s> How much is left?
<s> Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
<s> Shot himself. What for ?
<s> All right I got a little surprise for you --
<s> When'd you do it?
<s> Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
<s> Ours.
<s> Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
<s> What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
<s> Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
<s> Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
<s> Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
<s> Six to eight feet.
<s> Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
<s> No. Walked.
<s> No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
<s> Hairy ?
<s> So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> Yes.
<s> You get to know each other pretty well out there.
<s> Sure.
<s> No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
<s> We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
<s> What is this bridge?
<s> Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
<s> Why didn't he shoot you?
<s> No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
<s> And shut up.
<s> No. Not really.
<s> The river is beautiful.
<s> Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
<s> Needs patching.
<s> 89   CONTINUED:
<s> Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
<s> 157  CONTINUED:
<s> Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
<s> 28   CONTINUED:
<s> Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
<s> Why?
<s> He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
<s> I bet you haven't had lunch.
<s> -- Permanently?
<s> Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
<s> I'm staying.
<s> I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
<s> My home is here.  With you.
<s> Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
<s> Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
<s> A daughter in Oregon.
<s> Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
<s> I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
<s> We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
<s> It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
<s> Too bad we're heading west.
<s> How many do you see?
<s> You got one?
<s> Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
<s> Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
<s> Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
<s> You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
<s> Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
<s> I got it from here.  Thanks.
<s> If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
<s> Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
<s> I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Any idea who could've done it?
<s> Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
<s> Get the fuck out of here.
<s> I'm right fuckin' here with you.
<s> Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
<s> Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
<s> Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
<s> Stay out of this...  Doctor?
<s> Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
<s> He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
<s> Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
<s> Okay.
<s> I see the help -- judgement call.
<s> It's okay -- I'll sit here.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
<s> Yes.
<s> He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
<s> Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
<s> Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
<s> Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
<s> Whether crabs are in season there now...
<s> Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
<s> It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
<s> Welcome.
<s> Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
<s> Dancing?
<s> Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
<s> Never.
<s> What do you mean? You said you liked it.
<s> I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
<s> Yes. I really would.
<s> No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
<s> Don't want to. I love you.
<s> Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
<s> Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
<s> Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
<s> What?
<s> Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
<s> Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
<s> Ask him.
<s> Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
<s> Well, that's a load off.
<s> Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
<s> I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
<s> Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
<s> No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
<s> Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
<s> I forgot to lock the door.
<s> What's it mean?
<s> Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
<s> Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
<s> I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
<s> No fucking way.
<s> What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
<s> How long have you been freelance?
<s> We both know what you were doing.
<s> What?  What's okay?
<s> I ain't scared of you.
<s> Why don't you tell me.
<s> I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
<s> I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
<s> The contract was stolen.
<s> Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
<s> Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
<s> What?  How did you know I had a cat?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm part of the game, just like you.
<s> The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
<s> If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
<s> Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
<s> Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
<s> As in daughter of Agamemnon?
<s> Why?
<s> Why not?
<s> You went from high school to the Agency?
<s> Ahhhh...
<s> The exotic women.
<s> Why?
<s> Tell me about the first time.
<s> Yes.
<s> Several.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Taiwan.
<s> Transmits and receives.
<s> But he won't shoot you right then?
<s> Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
<s> We split the money?
<s> Sounds pretty well figured out.
<s> You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
<s> I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
<s> It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
<s> No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
<s> Yes.  Here I am again.
<s> Why in the hell would you take that chance?
<s> When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
<s> Okay.
<s> God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
<s> How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
<s> I think you're supposed to answer that question.
<s> Everyone regrets something.
<s> Do you believe that?
<s> I hope not.
<s> I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
<s> Anything.
<s> No.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
<s> And not even then sometimes.
<s> What's that? Free!
<s> No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
<s> You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
<s> Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
<s> These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
<s> Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
<s> He was an electrician?
<s> That makes you an expert I guess.
<s> A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
<s> I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
<s> Thought of everything haven't you.
<s> 'cause you stink of booze.
<s> But how did the wall get here?
<s> And suppose a little old lady lives there?
<s> Have you ever stolen anything?
<s> Who put a bee up your butt?
<s> Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
<s> You capitalist pig!
<s> Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
<s> He's lying! I am.
<s> No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
<s> Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
<s> Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
<s> I'm not hungry, really.
<s> We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
<s> So am I.
<s> I'll take a rain-check for now.
<s> Yeah, maybe.
<s> I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
<s> What?
<s> Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
<s> Yep, it's all yours.
<s> Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
<s> A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
<s> I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
<s> What for?
<s> No, just a coffee.
<s> Alright!
<s> It's Josh's.
<s> Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
<s> Not all of them!
<s> The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
<s> You may use my office.
<s> A drill, what are you up to?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No problem, is it at your place?
<s> But I have to finish this....
<s> Maybe it is!
<s> Don't you dare, I'll be back!
<s> Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
<s> The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
<s> That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
<s> It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
<s> Very well.
<s> With you.
<s> -- I like the car I have.
<s> I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
<s> I need to whizz.
<s> 'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
<s> -- Your act only works with an audience.
<s> Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
<s> Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
<s> I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
<s> You don't miss a thing.
<s> Yes. And?
<s> Yeah --
<s> That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
<s> You're hardly nice to anyone.
<s> You don't know what you want --
<s> Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
<s> Why not?
<s> No.
<s> You're sometimes not sure?
<s> Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
<s> The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
<s> Sure.
<s> Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
<s> I should have told you sooner --
<s> I will.
<s> That I want you to take me home.
<s> I'm not going back to school.
<s> I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
<s> Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
<s> No.
<s> Lead man.
<s> Does it have to do with Jamie?
<s> I don't want to see her hurt.
<s> Like what, sir?
<s> How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
<s> I want to come back.
<s> When do I get time for me?
<s> The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> No....
<s> I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
<s> Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
<s> Seventeen.
<s> Poly-what?
<s> Have we ever met before?
<s> Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
<s> But he didn't ask me.
<s> Eileen, Chinese food again?
<s> What drill?
<s> Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
<s> Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
<s> Pro! Release the rope!
<s> ...To be traveled through
<s> Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
<s> Why?
<s> You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
<s> The power converter...
<s> Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
<s> Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
<s> Professor, be serious, would you?
<s> But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
<s> What do you call this? 
<s> Sure,.
<s> Hi, Marty!
<s> Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
<s> She plays the clarinet, too.
<s> Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
<s> Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
<s> I used to throw trash for the City.
<s> Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
<s> I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
<s> For coming onto my property... With a gun.
<s> You love him?
<s> Yeah. I can imagine.
<s> What for?
<s> Nah, I got me a job.
<s> Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
<s> What?
<s> Well, stop the world.
<s> Great.
<s> Yeah, but I don't like it.
<s> How bad off is he?
<s> They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
<s> He was nervous.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Anybody ever done that to you before?
<s> Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
<s> Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
<s> Just gimme a chance.
<s> Hold it right there.
<s> You wanna take the chance, Casper?
<s> Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
<s> I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
<s> Got a half a tuna sandwich.
<s> Vanished. Thin air.
<s> Arachtoid.
<s> Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
<s> I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
<s> Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
<s> John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
<s> Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
<s> Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
<s> She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
<s> Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
<s> I wish he was.  He's real enough.
<s> I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
<s> Believe in Penny Priddy?
<s> Flying to Cambodia.
<s> He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
<s> That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
<s> Garland, it's me.
<s> What DID you mean?
<s> What else?
<s> All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
<s> But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
<s> Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
<s> Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
<s> I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
<s> You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
<s> Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
<s> No, what did it say?
<s> Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
<s> Well, I'm a writer, actually.
<s> Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
<s> No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
<s> And I could tell you some stories 
<s> See you, Charlie.
<s> Charlie. How are you.
<s> Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear?
<s> Not at all. It's damned interesting.
<s> Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
<s> Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me  I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
<s> Well...
<s> No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
<s> I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
<s> Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
<s> Lou.
<s> Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
<s> Mr. Lipnik.
<s> Yes sir, they 
<s> Huh?
<s> What 
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're a sick fuck, Fink.
<s> Anyway.
<s> Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
<s> No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
<s> Ya see how he's not writing it down?
<s> I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
<s> Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
<s> When did you start drinking again?
<s> No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who's got access to my goddamn file?
<s> You saw all the reports, Beth!
<s> A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
<s> Why not?
<s> No.
<s> Fine.
<s> There's Pepsi in the fridge.
<s> What do you want from me, Catherine?
<s> I'll risk it.
<s> I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
<s> Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
<s> I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
<s> Really.  What are you writing about.
<s> We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
<s> What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
<s> No.
<s> How's that?
<s> Was his wife ever a suspect?
<s> Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
<s> What are you doing here, Pop?
<s> I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
<s> Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
<s> Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
<s> You're looking for Catherine, not me.
<s> I'm sure.
<s> Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
<s> What about me?
<s> Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
<s> She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
<s> Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
<s> Can you check again?
<s> You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
<s> The whole thing  painting.
<s> I think it's in New Jersey.
<s> Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
<s> Do you still love her?
<s> Well, have you asked her to come back?
<s> You want a drink?
<s> Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
<s> I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
<s> That's the same guy who did this painting.
<s> I didn't see you.
<s> I hate this. Turn that off.
<s> Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
<s> About what?
<s> Oh  you mean black people!
<s> Party girls? Can I call you?
<s> C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
<s> Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
<s> It's Monday morning.
<s> Basquiat, what did you take?
<s> I hadn't thought about it.
<s> Think so?
<s> You mean babies with you?
<s> Hi.
<s> How is he?
<s> George?
<s> You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
<s> You only want one Big Mac?
<s> It's three thousand dollars!
<s> That's great.
<s> Hi.
<s> Stand still.
<s> Thanks
<s> I'd like to squeeze your titties.
<s> No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
<s> Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
<s> No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
<s> I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I just don't think you're being fair.
<s> It's vichyssoise, sir.
<s> Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
<s> I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
<s> You'll never guess.
<s> I'm -- sorry, I --
<s> ...four, five.
<s> I tried to grab you -- save you --
<s> Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
<s> Yes and no...
<s> Y'mean take off our costumes?
<s> Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
<s> Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
<s> Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
<s> He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
<s> You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
<s> Dad!  Save yourself!
<s> She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
<s> PMS.
<s> And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
<s> As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
<s> What is it?
<s> Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
<s> There's a lovely inn just down --
<s> Right here, sir.
<s> Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
<s> Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
<s> You'd be surprised.
<s> Mr. Freeze.
<s> The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
<s> He'll be here.
<s> Me too.  Great stems, though.
<s> Definitely.
<s> A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
<s> Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
<s> Bruce?  What are you doing?
<s> Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
<s> I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
<s> Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
<s> She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
<s> Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
<s> You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
<s> Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
<s> Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
<s> You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
<s> You leave Batman and Robin to me.
<s> Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
<s> Where is my wife?
<s> Adam and Evil.
<s> Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
<s> To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
<s> Tell me and I'll kiss you.
<s> I've got to stop him.
<s> You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
<s> Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
<s> But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
<s> Enigma.
<s> Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
<s> Just checking, young sir.
<s> I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
<s> I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
<s> It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
<s> No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
<s> Wacko? That a technical term?
<s> So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
<s> I'm sorry. Who are you?
<s> I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
<s> Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
<s> I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
<s> You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
<s> I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
<s> Bruce, you can't.
<s> How could I forget?
<s> Can't tell if you don't say please.
<s> Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
<s> I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
<s> ... Very good, sir.
<s> WHICH CAR?
<s> I loathe bats.
<s> Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
<s> ... Looks like a convention.
<s> Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
<s> He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
<s> Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
<s> Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
<s> Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
<s> ... Behind the makeup?
<s> Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
<s> A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
<s> All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
<s> Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
<s> His face.  Allie, look at his face.
<s> Oh, Bruce...
<s> Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
<s> Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
<s> It's gone.
<s> What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
<s> I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
<s> 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
<s> Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
<s> About Charles...
<s> No, I'm fine.
<s> Annie, it's me.
<s> Night.
<s> oh dear.
<s> Ahm.... .
<s> Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
<s> Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
<s> Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
<s> Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
<s> I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
<s> NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
<s> Of course he is.
<s> Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
<s> Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
<s> Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
<s> Uh... Uh...
<s> Huh huh. No way, dude.
<s> Cool! Huh huh huh.
<s> Heh hmm heh heh.
<s> What's your problem Beavis?
<s> Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
<s> Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
<s> Heh heh, thanks.
<s> Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
<s> Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
<s> Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
<s> That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
<s> Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
<s> Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
<s> Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
<s> Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
<s> Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
<s> Uh, ten uh...
<s> We're rich in what really matters.
<s> I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
<s> This is going to take some time.
<s> I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
<s> Won't?  Or can't?
<s> Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
<s> Not really...  what's this?
<s> We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
<s> No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
<s> It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
<s> <u>Betelgeuse</u>!
<s> Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
<s> Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
<s> I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
<s> He might have hurt somebody.
<s> Little black party dresses?
<s> Let's see if she can get my model back.
<s> What makes you think she likes me?
<s> Just a hunch.
<s> 3:30 I guess.
<s> God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
<s> Really.  I don't know.
<s> W... We didn't know how to make one.
<s> Now, let's get rolling!
<s> I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
<s> We need help.  We deserve help.
<s> What do you expect?  You're dead.
<s> I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
<s> Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
<s> Are you a spirit too?
<s> I want to get in.
<s> Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I... I don't know what your name is.
<s> 
<s> I'm beeyoo-teeful.
<s> Let me have it.
<s> Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
<s> They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
<s> Any particular kind?
<s> I'm sorry already.
<s> The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
<s> I thought I saw something.
<s> Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
<s> Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
<s> What happened to the people who used to live here?
<s> It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
<s> I understand. I've seen it done before.
<s> How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
<s> Thank you, Robert.
<s> Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
<s> We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
<s> ... But he's...?
<s> I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
<s> Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
<s> Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
<s> No sir, I don't believe I do.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Yes. I would like to be on that show.
<s> Yes. He's a very careful driver.
<s> I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
<s> Yes, so do we.
<s> That's good. I like to watch, too.
<s> I see.
<s> Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
<s> He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
<s> We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
<s> We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
<s> ... I see.
<s> Yes. You look very sick.
<s> I agree.
<s> I see. I would like to work in your garden.
<s> But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
<s> Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
<s> Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
<s> I see, Ben.
<s> Yes. That is correct.
<s> No, Ben.
<s> Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
<s> Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
<s> I like to watch.
<s> Yes. I like to watch very much.
<s> I can't write.
<s> Yes. I like to watch.
<s> Yes, I would like to see Ben.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I hope so.
<s> ... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
<s> I see...
<s> Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
<s> Compensated...?
<s> I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
<s> Come now, Mr. Chance.
<s> ... Nothing.
<s> ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
<s> Try again.
<s> ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
<s> Would you two excuse me for a moment?
<s> It's not that, I just...
<s> Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
<s> ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
<s> Gardiner, yes, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
<s> Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Thank you, Colonel.
<s> Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
<s> Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
<s> Mr. Gardiner...
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh yeah, he's good.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Malkovich!
<s> Who am I thinking of?
<s> Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
<s> Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
<s> Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
<s> I'm a puppeteer.
<s> Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
<s> I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
<s> No they're not.
<s> What's that?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
<s> Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
<s> You bastard.
<s> Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
<s> And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
<s> I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
<s> Holy shit, yes!
<s> Holy shit! He said what I said!
<s> Yes?
<s> I said "yes."
<s> No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
<s> More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
<s> Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
<s> Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
<s> Yikes.
<s> No.
<s> Sure. It'd be fun.
<s> My God.
<s> So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
<s> Are you torturing me on purpose?
<s> You're evil, Maxine.
<s> How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
<s> Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
<s> And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
<s> Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
<s> Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
<s> No you mustn't, my child.
<s> No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
<s> You bastard!
<s> Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
<s> I have to see you.
<s> I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
<s> Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
<s> We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
<s> Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
<s> Oh, I'm really glad you called.
<s> Do you mind?
<s> Oh, Lotte...
<s> I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
<s> Really? Yeah. Okay.
<s> Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
<s> He's a selfish bastard.
<s> Was a time I knew what was.
<s> What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
<s> Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
<s> Don't pay to complain.
<s> No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
<s> No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
<s> At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
<s> Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
<s> Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
<s> I don't know him that well.
<s> Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
<s> Her who?
<s> Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
<s> You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
<s> You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
<s> Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
<s> She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
<s> You got to get up from here, girl.
<s> She was my best thing.
<s> Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
<s> Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
<s> It's the LeBaron.
<s> You don't know shit, Lebowski.
<s> The?  Who the fff--
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yeah, but we're--
<s> My rug.
<s> Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
<s> So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
<s> Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
<s> I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
<s> No--
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Far out.
<s> Different mothers, huh?
<s> I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
<s> --smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
<s> Color?
<s> Separate incidents?
<s> One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
<s> Yeah.  Thanks man.
<s> But she hasn't run off, she's been--
<s> Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
<s> Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
<s> You're not interested in sex?
<s> Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
<s> I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
<s> Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
<s> Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
<s> Okay. That, uh.
<s> Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
<s> Huh?
<s> It's your roll.
<s> My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
<s> What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
<s> Huh?
<s> I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
<s> What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
<s> C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
<s> Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
<s> Whose toe was it, Walter?
<s> Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
<s> Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
<s> Dude--
<s> --We're sympathizing here, Dude--
<s> Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
<s> We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
<s> And the fucking money!
<s> I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
<s> Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
<s> What's your point, Dude?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Hey, cool it Walter.
<s> Dude, I'm sorry--
<s> Right, Dude.
<s> You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
<s> Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
<s> My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
<s> Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
<s> Bunny.
<s> Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
<s> Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
<s> Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
<s> Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
<s> What the hell are you doing, Blade?
<s> He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
<s> Minutes.
<s> For what?
<s> Not good.
<s> Either that or feeding the worms.
<s> Sounds like a plan.
<s> I don't like it.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it.
<s> Then who does he work for?
<s> Blood...
<s> Not alone.
<s> I should think that would be obvious at this point.
<s> Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
<s> I don't know about this, man --
<s> He was here.  Watching us.
<s> You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
<s> Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
<s> No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
<s> Don't even start, old man.
<s> I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
<s> How can you be out here?
<s> "The Blood Tide".
<s> He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
<s> What do you see here?
<s> How can you tell?
<s> You get used to the darkness.
<s> Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
<s> You're a week early.
<s> You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
<s> I don't believe that.
<s> Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
<s> Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
<s> Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
<s> The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
<s> You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
<s> So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
<s> Go on, I'll be fine!
<s> Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
<s> Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
<s> How?
<s> Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
<s> A coward too. That's why she had to go.
<s> I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
<s> Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
<s> There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
<s> She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
<s> What is <u>this</u>?
<s> You don't want it though.
<s> You feel no need to get married or anything.
<s> You said the name "James."
<s> What?
<s> I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
<s> --no, what's wrong with you?
<s> --fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
<s> I can't let you in.
<s> --yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
<s> What? That made her lose the baby?
<s> Turn the tapes back on.
<s> Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
<s> Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
<s> That's what Josh and Mike said.
<s> What're you doing with all this shit?
<s> I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
<s> No idea--goddamitt!
<s> Down there in the Park.
<s> I am.
<s> I'm not finished.
<s> It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
<s> --now there.
<s> Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
<s> First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
<s> A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
<s> --great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
<s> No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
<s> I think it's time to get out of here.
<s> What're you nuts--
<s> Ah, Domini?
<s> Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
<s> What?
<s> Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
<s> Anna--
<s> There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
<s> It won't?
<s> Something happened with Marty and Ray--
<s> I just gotta see a guy.
<s> What?
<s> If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
<s> ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
<s> Abby... you all right?
<s> You're bad.
<s> I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
<s> Marty.
<s> I think someone's watching.
<s> You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
<s> I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
<s> ...Friday?
<s> Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
<s> I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
<s> I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
<s> What do you think?
<s> I want you to go fishing.
<s> ...What kind of fish?
<s> Got something to show me first?
<s> Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
<s> How would I know?
<s> Right. Sorry.
<s> Right.
<s> What?
<s> I'm not sick.
<s> Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
<s> Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
<s> The criminals are winning.
<s> Yes.
<s> Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
<s> Oh my God. Is her son OK?
<s> Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
<s> You want to see him too, right?
<s> Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
<s> Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
<s> Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
<s> I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
<s> What?
<s> . same here.
<s> Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
<s> No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
<s> What if Frank came over here and found us?
<s> Do you love me?
<s> I did. are you?
<s> They hurt his head.
<s> Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
<s> Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
<s> Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
<s> My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
<s> Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
<s> There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
<s> Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
<s> Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
<s> I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
<s> You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
<s> Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
<s> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
<s> Look. it can wait till Sunday.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
<s> I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
<s> You better not, Jeffrey.
<s> I can't dance fast.
<s> Let's wait for some slow one.
<s> Okay.
<s> No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
<s> He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
<s> Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
<s> I'll get a coat for her.
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
<s> What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
<s> What?
<s> He what?
<s> Baby, you didn't have to come.
<s> What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
<s> What?  Yeah, sure.
<s> It's your grass.
<s> It's your grass.
<s> Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
<s> It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
<s> Nice doing business with you, George.
<s> Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
<s> Yeah.  She told me.
<s> For calling you a homo.
<s> Get me a six pack.
<s> Murder.
<s> Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
<s> I just got released five minutes ago.
<s> Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
<s> It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
<s> What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
<s> But to the victor belong the spoils.
<s> Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
<s> It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
<s> I love you too, man.
<s> What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
<s> Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
<s> No more brothers, Diego.
<s> George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
<s> Oh, I see.
<s> Mom.
<s> Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
<s> That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
<s> I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
<s> Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
<s> Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
<s> Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> She did that before.
<s> That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
<s> Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
<s> George, he wasn't asking.
<s> What's happening to us?
<s> Are we gonna split up?
<s> You mean, like a trip?
<s> Yeah.
<s> California.
<s> You swear?
<s> We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
<s> What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
<s> I wish there was shit like this back home.
<s> Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
<s> Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
<s> Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
<s> The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
<s> Sail.
<s> Second district ...
<s> Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
<s> Sure ...
<s> Good evening, sir.
<s> Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
<s> She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
<s> How can I give you this statement?
<s> You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
<s> How?
<s> No -- never.
<s> Counsel approach the bench.
<s> We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
<s> Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
<s> Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
<s> The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
<s> Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
<s> I assume his girlfriend.
<s> No -- never.
<s> No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
<s> Yes.
<s> Intense.
<s> It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
<s> She didn't.  She just left.
<s> Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
<s> I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
<s> Who was your primary beneficiary?
<s> We stopped seeing each other.
<s> She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
<s> We had dinner at a restaurant.
<s> Yes.
<s> Chinese peony root.
<s> Then -- those are not your own words?
<s> We dated for about a month last year.
<s> He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
<s> What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
<s> He video taped you.
<s> It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
<s> You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
<s> Yes.
<s> And she left shortly after that?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
<s> I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
<s> It's okay.
<s> I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
<s> I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
<s> That's crazy.
<s> That wasn't the deal.
<s> I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
<s> No, Your Honor.
<s> That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
<s> And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
<s> No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
<s> He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
<s> Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
<s> That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
<s> Why didn't you come to me?
<s> Sorry.
<s> We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
<s> Doesn't matter. Move on.
<s> Why are there two deeds here?
<s> No treasure maps, huh?
<s> That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
<s> "... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
<s> This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
<s> I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
<s> I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
<s> No. What a tragedy. What happened?
<s> Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
<s> I don't mind waiting.
<s> Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
<s> Francesca.
<s> A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
<s> She starts sniffing me.
<s> We got engaged.
<s> Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
<s> I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
<s> No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
<s> Wonderful. Uh...
<s> No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
<s> I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
<s> Oh, how is he?
<s> What?
<s> Nobody's asking you to.
<s> Near the church.
<s> Trouble. Why?
<s> I had a temper.
<s> Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
<s> Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
<s> No one's asking you to!
<s> WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
<s> Yeah. It could get better.
<s> Yes. And I've accepted.
<s> I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
<s> I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
<s> Frannie.
<s> I'm going to miss you.
<s> Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
<s> Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
<s> What happened?
<s> They're not going to find her!
<s> Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
<s> Just some flies.
<s> Spooked?
<s> Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
<s> Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
<s> But that's your old hood, Pops.
<s> Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
<s> Wh-wh-whooo?
<s> All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
<s> I have to finish this for class.
<s> You mean as opposed to your life?
<s> But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
<s> I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
<s> No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
<s> Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
<s> Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
<s> Bill!  Bill?!
<s> Okay, okay.  Listen:
<s> Fuck it.  Alright.
<s> Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
<s> It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
<s> And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
<s> You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
<s> That's it.  Get out.  Now!
<s> Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
<s> Should I?
<s> Ours!
<s> What's that, Johnnie?
<s> I think you're fucking crazy!
<s> Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
<s> Jesus, Caesar!
<s> It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> All right, Caesar.
<s> Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
<s> Let us go and we'll make a deal.
<s> Shut up!
<s> They were in a car accident.
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> I knew I couldn't trust you.
<s> Where's the fucking money?
<s> No.  Rajeev's in India.
<s> My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
<s> Hey, Mickey.
<s> What?  They ain't there?
<s> Caesar, you still got the money?
<s> I thought I heard someone knocking.
<s> Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
<s> Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
<s> Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
<s> Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
<s> This is the police, ma'am.
<s> How do I know you are cops?
<s> ...  thank you.
<s> Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
<s> Basically.
<s> I guess I wanted to.
<s> If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
<s> I'm not afraid of anything.
<s> What was it then?
<s> What about that guy this morning?
<s> Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
<s> You think I'm lying?
<s> Do you think you know me like that?
<s> He hung it up.
<s> If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
<s> I won't.
<s> That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
<s> That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
<s> Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
<s> Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
<s> Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
<s> So it's time to go home.
<s> It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
<s> One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
<s> Yes.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I hadn't heard.
<s> Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
<s> Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
<s> I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
<s> No.
<s> I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
<s> I don't know.
<s> There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
<s> Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
<s> -- please -- Jason -- omigod --
<s> xxxxxx
<s> xxxxxx
<s> So get the hell out of here.
<s> -- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
<s> -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
<s> Enhance it.
<s> -- he accessed the account --
<s> All of them?
<s> I told you.  You need to rest.
<s> I won't forget this.
<s> He's tampered with it, Dowser.
<s> ...aven't you?
<s> ... yer ducts.
<s> What? You mean you've got ...
<s> You don't have to sing it.
<s> Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
<s> Layton.
<s> I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
<s> Beginner's luck.
<s> No, no ... I did that...
<s> Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
<s> Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
<s> Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
<s> Er, I knew you looked different.
<s> What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
<s> Am I?
<s> How do you mean?
<s> B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
<s> What has Tuttle done?
<s> We don't make mistakes.
<s> Bastard!!!
<s> What?
<s> Ah.
<s> Oh.
<s> Who are you?
<s> Them?
<s> Oh, sorry.
<s> It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
<s> What?
<s> What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
<s> You're joking.
<s> "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
<s> Yes.
<s> C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> 27156789/074328/K.
<s> Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
<s> This is your dream girl, is it?
<s> You haven't switched it on.
<s> Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
<s> A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
<s> I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
<s> You're not listening, mother.
<s> Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
<s> Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
<s> He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
<s> There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
<s> I know, I know ...!
<s> Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
<s> Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
<s> Hello. Mr Lowry?
<s> What? Who is this?
<s> No need, sir
<s> Central Services.
<s> Fixed itself.
<s> The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
<s> She say she in great pain.
<s> He looks like a cop.
<s> He flipped out.
<s> Sleeping in the back.
<s> That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
<s> I can't hold up my head anymore.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Yes.
<s> They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
<s> I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
<s> Maybe I should come up with you.
<s> It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
<s> Frank.
<s> I think the worst is over.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
<s> She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
<s> Here's to the greatest job in the world.
<s> Crazy fucker.
<s> He was tough. You did all you could.
<s> Yeah. Great, isn't it?
<s> Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
<s> I've taken that into consideration.
<s> Why?
<s> Okay, whatta I do?
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
<s> Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
<s> Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
<s> You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
<s> Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
<s> I'll put her on.
<s> Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
<s> No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
<s> I'll see you back at the hotel.
<s> At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
<s> A half hour in the lobby.
<s> No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
<s> This conversation is not worthy of you.
<s> Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
<s> I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
<s> Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
<s> Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
<s> Okay, great -- good luck.
<s> Then it went well.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> This isn't friendship.
<s> Sit down, stop.
<s> Speaking.
<s> I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
<s> Wipe me out?
<s> It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
<s> Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
<s> What is she shooting?
<s> Yes.
<s> I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
<s> We could...
<s> Should I...
<s> No, I don't think so.
<s> I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
<s> One's enough.
<s> Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
<s> Thanks a lot, Buddy.
<s> Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
<s> No.  Not even you.
<s> No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
<s> It's not.
<s> Hey?
<s> You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
<s> And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
<s> Yes.
<s> Billion.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
<s> Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
<s> Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
<s> It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
<s> You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
<s> Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
<s> Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
<s> He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
<s> Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
<s> I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
<s> It just proves that the difference we have are...
<s> Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
<s> Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
<s> A picnic?
<s> I can't be.
<s> Right back to you.
<s> I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
<s> It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I just might.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> I'm going home!
<s> Oh it's enough...
<s> N-no...
<s> Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
<s> Carla...
<s> There there...
<s> Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
<s> Hm...
<s> Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
<s> Just about anything, Walter.
<s> I'm honored to know this man.
<s> Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
<s> What are you doing here so early?
<s> Leonard, what are you doing?
<s> Nothing...nothing at all.
<s> Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
<s> I know, man.
<s> Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
<s> No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
<s> What is it, your laundry?
<s> I didn't mean to.
<s> A parakeet?
<s> N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
<s> Yeah and what would I say?
<s> It was.
<s> I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
<s> Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
<s> Smack?
<s> Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
<s> I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
<s> Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
<s> Yes, get rid of them...
<s> Here here!
<s> Hiya Maxwell.
<s> Really?
<s> Gee.  Thanks.
<s> If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
<s> Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
<s> Would you sleep with them?
<s> You think?  Split?
<s> Get away from here.
<s> Down there.
<s> Eeyuu.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
<s> It's the news, Buffy.
<s> 'Bye.
<s> So I noticed.
<s> I thought we were meeting here.
<s> You weren't home.  Like always.
<s> I'm out of here.  Jenny.
<s> Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
<s> I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
<s> Besides, Oxnard sucks.
<s> Merrick...
<s> What for?
<s> ) What do you think?
<s> 'Just remember you're in training, son'
<s> Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
<s> This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
<s> Yeah, whoops I came.
<s> To bring you... your birthright.
<s> You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
<s> Lothos.
<s> I have to show you.
<s> In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
<s> All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
<s> Who we gonna beat?
<s> Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
<s> Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
<s> Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
<s> Five.
<s> As for example, what?
<s> Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
<s> You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
<s> You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
<s> Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
<s> I was just scared is all.
<s> Oh.
<s> What's happening?  What do you want?
<s> Really?
<s> Hi, Grueller.
<s> Okay, what else?
<s> Oh, baby!
<s> I heard she got straight A's.
<s> Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
<s> Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
<s> Like we don't have rights too?
<s> Oh, please.
<s> Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
<s> What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
<s> Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
<s> Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
<s> Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
<s> I know what it is.
<s> Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
<s> Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
<s> Don't worry.
<s> No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
<s> Crash, I didn't think you--
<s> What do you believe in?
<s> So...Wanta make love?
<s> Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
<s> He won't make love to me anymore.
<s> I want you desperately!
<s> Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
<s> What's so great about baseball?
<s> You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
<s> Ninety-five miles an hour...
<s> Oh let's not...
<s> You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
<s> Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
<s> I thought I was--
<s> A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
<s> What?
<s> Annie's a smart lady.
<s> Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
<s> Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
<s> Jesus.
<s> Yep.  So how's Annie?
<s> God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
<s> Forget it.
<s> I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
<s> The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
<s> Crash, shut the door.
<s> From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
<s> Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
<s> Can I give you my testimony?
<s> Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.

<s> Matter of fact...
<s> Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
<s> Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
<s> Somethin', huh?
<s> Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
<s> You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
<s> Why, somebody's complaining?
<s> That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
<s> Yeah.
<s> She came to talk to me...
<s> It's none of my business?
<s> Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
<s> What are you -
<s> Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
<s> It's me.
<s> Well...
<s> Yeah, she's here.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
<s> Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
<s> I-I'm sorry, Sam.
<s> No, Ace.
<s> Ace, listen to me.
<s> 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
<s> ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
<s> That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
<s> Nice to see you, Senator.
<s> Call security.
<s> L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
<s> What is it?
<s> You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
<s> Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
<s> ...they didn't know what really moved her.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
<s> Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
<s> Okay?
<s> With what?
<s> There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
<s> Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
<s> Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
<s> What if he won't stop?
<s> I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
<s> You want your jewelry?
<s> Not gonna let me in?
<s> These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
<s> Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
<s> I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
<s> Can you do it with your left hand?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Thanks, Nick.
<s> I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
<s> You shut up.
<s> Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
<s> Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
<s> Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
<s> Now move along.
<s> He's gone?
<s> Calm down! Calm down!
<s> Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
<s> I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
<s> Mm, you want to steal it? 
<s> Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
<s> It's all right.
<s> I don't - 
<s> Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
<s> Okay.
<s> 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
<s> A sponsor.
<s> If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
<s> But I saw something...
<s> I love you.
<s> We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
<s> Lester - he called you here.
<s> Here.
<s> They check in alone?
<s> All right.
<s> What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
<s> Hold it, hold it. Here.
<s> Get up.
<s> Nicky sends his warmest regards.
<s> ...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
<s> Let's get out of here.
<s> Yeah, what'd you tell him?
<s> You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
<s> Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
<s> Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
<s> Hey.
<s> What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
<s> ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
<s> Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
<s> Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
<s> I lied.
<s> It may be time to get the police involved...
<s> Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
<s> I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
<s> Even the skylight?
<s> What about "climbing in?"
<s> I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
<s> He didn't remember to roll up his window...
<s> A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
<s> I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
<s> I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
<s> For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
<s> You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
<s> What's the name of your child's best friend?
<s> What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
<s> What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
<s> About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
<s> I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
<s> Yes, Mother. Dear.
<s> Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
<s> I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
<s> This is one way.
<s> Do I hear a woman's voice?
<s> Taking messages.
<s> That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
<s> I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
<s> You could've made me lose my call.
<s> Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
<s> I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
<s> It's taken care of.
<s> Just like they say; no fucking self control.
<s> I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
<s> Allow me.
<s> There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
<s> I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
<s> You don't understand.
<s> Will you let me explain!
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
<s> Then hang up!  Do it!
<s> They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
<s> How much time do you have left on it?
<s> Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
<s> Pictures.
<s> They say my work is somewhat derivative.
<s> No.
<s> Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
<s> Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> You're all three of you in that van?
<s> I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
<s> Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
<s> You're going to let them get away with this?
<s> The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
<s> L.A.P.D.
<s> You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
<s> The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
<s> Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
<s> I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
<s> No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
<s> 259-7881.
<s> I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
<s> We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
<s> Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
<s> We can't leave him to repeat anything.
<s> Naturally.
<s> He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
<s> Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
<s> I don't want it.
<s> Who is this?
<s> You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
<s> Keep talking.
<s> It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
<s> Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
<s> Are you trying to panic the women?
<s> She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
<s> What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
<s> Call me "Nels."
<s> If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
<s> The fuck I will!
<s> There's two police cars now.
<s> You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
<s> How do you know?
<s> If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
<s> There's no lady here.
<s> From here on, I dish it out.
<s> Yeah?
<s> She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
<s> What do you think his name is?
<s> Who the fuck is he?
<s> Take your fucking goldfish, too!
<s> Bloody right I do...
<s> What's it to you?
<s> No.
<s> They're jealous.
<s> How special?
<s> Jesus.
<s> The things a girl has to put up with.
<s> Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
<s> You say that like a gentleman.
<s> What is this?
<s> I'm thinking of your man.
<s> No...
<s> Where?
<s> What you doing here?
<s> I know that.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> He'd bring me carnations.
<s> Kind of.
<s> Afraid so.
<s> I promise.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> For me.
<s> Look on it like a honeymoon.
<s> I'm going home!
<s> You knew my Jody?
<s> I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
<s> Okay.
<s> He asked me to see were you all right.
<s> Let me go, Dil
<s> I like you, DIl
<s> Love you, Dil.
<s> Do I?
<s> Yes. Say hello to Col --
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> That's wise, Tommy.
<s> Need to go across the water.
<s> Can't.
<s> Yes.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> And what if you don't?
<s> Get that thing off me, Fergus --
<s> Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
<s> Peter.
<s> I understand.
<s> Aye, I do, Peter.
<s> Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Do what?
<s> They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
<s> And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
<s> No.
<s> What the fuck were you doing here?
<s> Ever see hurling?
<s> Hurry up, would you?
<s> Having a pint in the Rock.
<s> Like what?
<s> Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
<s> No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
<s> Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
<s> If they kill me --
<s> I told you not to talk that way --
<s> Tell me something, anything.
<s> No.
<s> The fastest.
<s> Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
<s> You don't know me, do you?
<s> Tell me, Jody
<s> Who gives a fuck.
<s> Whatever you say, Jude...
<s> Where are you, ol' buddy?
<s> How was I leading you on?
<s> What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
<s> Relax -- you're gaining.
<s> You're going to look for him -- now?
<s> Adam --
<s> Open up.
<s> Let's look anyway.
<s> I love you, Adam.
<s> Then who did? You're the only one left.
<s> Reggie -- listen to me --
<s> We? You mean you're --?
<s> But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
<s> But --
<s> Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
<s> Because they're still here.
<s> I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
<s> But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
<s> Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
<s> We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
<s> Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
<s> Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
<s> Open it.
<s> The view had better be worth it.
<s> Then who does?
<s> What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
<s> Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
<s> So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
<s> I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
<s> I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
<s> Why?
<s> A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
<s> What -- like Scobie?
<s> I'm scared.
<s> First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
<s> Shut the door!
<s> How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
<s> I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
<s> Fiction or non-fiction?
<s> Well!
<s> I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
<s> I'm afraid it is important.
<s> Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
<s> Here's ten.
<s> And if it is?
<s> The kid said --
<s> Stop it!
<s> In Mr. Dyle's room?
<s> It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
<s> Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
<s> We won! We won!
<s> A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
<s> I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
<s> You give up awfully easy, don't you?
<s> Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
<s> Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
<s> Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
<s> Charles is.
<s> I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
<s> The man and the woman are married --
<s> What was what?
<s> Good night.
<s> I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
<s> But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
<s> That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
<s> What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
<s> I believe what he said.
<s> Yes?
<s> But what?
<s> I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
<s> Don't you want me to stay?
<s> How can you tell?
<s> Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
<s> What?
<s> We want that money -- now!
<s> I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
<s> I think I know how to restore your reputation.
<s> Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
<s> I never fucked Rod.
<s> You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
<s> Not my imports.
<s> I get the imports.
<s> I want you to head right home after school.
<s> How much further?
<s> Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
<s> Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
<s> There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
<s> No. I'll handle this.
<s> No?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> This will relax her.
<s> I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
<s> A bullet to the right cerebellum.
<s> I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
<s> Yeah. You should check downstairs.
<s> Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
<s> You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
<s> But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
<s> You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
<s> There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
<s> What party?
<s> No.
<s> Ok.
<s> I can't right now.
<s> Everyone's getting ready for the party.
<s> I do not.
<s> My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
<s> What?
<s> You can ask me anything.
<s> No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
<s> Attacked how?
<s> You didn't believe her?
<s> How could you?
<s> The word is Mob.
<s> The principal?
<s> There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
<s> What?

<s> No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
<s> Do you know him?
<s> Honest?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
<s> His girlfriend?
<s> With her mother.
<s> That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
<s> Do you remember the figures we discussed?
<s> I think I'll kill her.
<s> Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
<s> I've been wanting to meet you.
<s> Summer colds are the worst.
<s> Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
<s> You mean that's what you're going to call it.
<s> Didn't you call?
<s> I don't.
<s> I heard it was an accident.
<s> Shut up.  Go on.
<s> Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
<s> I guess not.
<s> Of course.
<s> A private investigator?
<s> I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
<s> What are you having?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
<s> Oh... thank you.
<s> I have?
<s> It wasn't much of a lie.
<s> I was grateful.
<s> Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
<s> Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
<s> Yes. He never forgave him for it.
<s> No, I think I'd remember.
<s> Is that unusual?
<s> What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
<s> Your eye.
<s> It has to do with my father.
<s> You saw my fa... father? When?
<s> Give me an example.
<s> I am not!
<s> What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
<s> ...so that's why you hate him...
<s> I think I got something.
<s> I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
<s> Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
<s> Never.
<s> When it comes? What'd you tell him?
<s> So how are you, Morty?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure you do.
<s> Mr. Gittes...
<s> Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
<s> Yeah, I'll do that.
<s> I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
<s> Yes. No.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. Yes, they were partners.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.

<s> Why? What do you mean?
<s> That's right, Modern Times.

<s> Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
<s> Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
<s> It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
<s> OK...
<s> I didn't see that.
<s> Two cents.
<s> These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
<s> I know.
<s> You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
<s> That's a long story.
<s> -  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
<s> Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
<s> Charlie?!
<s> Yes.
<s> Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
<s> Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
<s> I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
<s> Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
<s> Has he said when he'll finish?
<s> The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
<s> Emily -
<s> Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
<s> I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
<s> I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
<s> I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> Hmm!
<s> If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
<s> You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
<s> I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
<s> But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
<s> Oh, me -
<s> I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
<s> You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
<s> I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
<s> Susan, I really think -
<s> I'm not sorry.
<s> I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
<s> Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
<s> You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes?
<s> It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
<s> You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
<s> I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
<s> Yes.
<s> If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
<s> Sure.
<s> Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
<s> I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
<s> Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
<s> Are you serious?
<s> He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
<s> It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
<s> This? How long have you been smoking?
<s> This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
<s> Okay. I'm sorry about that.
<s> Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
<s> No, this is great.
<s> It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
<s> Dante. You've got a customer.
<s> Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
<s> Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
<s> No, you're not really getting married?
<s> How like her.
<s> Thanks for the vote of confidence.
<s> Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
<s> I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
<s> But can we date?
<s> We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
<s> So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
<s> He's your fianc.
<s> What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
<s> Um... okay.
<s> Was it you?
<s> No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
<s> Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
<s> What's your point?
<s> We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
<s> He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
<s> Your mother.
<s> That's frightening.
<s> Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
<s> The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
<s> There's more?
<s> So?
<s> Wait.
<s> Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
<s> He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
<s> You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
<s> How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
<s> I know.
<s> I don't back down.
<s> Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
<s> Gatorade.
<s> It's today.
<s> Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
<s> True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
<s> But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
<s> Twenty-two; same as us.
<s> Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
<s> I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
<s> If you must.
<s> Not yet. 
<s> I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
<s> What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
<s> And this is what you rented?
<s> Living proof.
<s> Watch the store while I go home and change.
<s> Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Shut the fuck up!
<s> What time did we go to the funeral?
<s> I was born.
<s> ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
<s> Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
<s> Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
<s> You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
<s> I know I can bench more than that!
<s> Yeah.
<s> All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
<s> Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
<s> A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
<s> So.
<s> I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
<s> If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
<s> No, he got hit by a bus.
<s> Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
<s> Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
<s> How do you figure?
<s> It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
<s> He gets off on it.
<s> Lower your voice!
<s> I'm going to class.
<s> Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
<s> Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
<s> I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
<s> Because he's out of shape.
<s> I like the way you think.
<s> I hope it feels good.
<s> You'll be missed.
<s> How long you gonna be here?
<s> Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
<s> He didn't ask me to...
<s> Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
<s> Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
<s> Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
<s> It can't fly in this weather.
<s> A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
<s> I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
<s> Hey, fuck you.
<s> I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
<s> There wasn't time for anything else.
<s> Just hangin' out.
<s> Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
<s> On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
<s> When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
<s> I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
<s> Why are you yelling?
<s> No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
<s> It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
<s> I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
<s> Up ahead.
<s> I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
<s> Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
<s> I won't do it.  No way.
<s> I burned it.
<s> How far?
<s> Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
<s> Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Half a day.
<s> On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
<s> Kill him when he gets down.
<s> Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
<s> Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
<s> I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
<s> We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
<s> Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
<s> You bastards... bastards.
<s> Good evening.
<s> Won't you join me, sir?
<s> Who are they, sir?
<s> Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
<s> A cup of the old chai, sir?
<s> Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
<s> And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
<s> That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
<s> That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
<s> Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
<s> Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
<s> Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
<s> We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
<s> Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
<s> One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
<s> Keeping fit then?
<s> Well - I'm back.
<s> Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
<s> Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
<s> Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
<s> Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
<s> C of E, sir.
<s> Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Crabs?
<s> What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
<s> Yes!!!
<s> I haven't seen you before.
<s> Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
<s> Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
<s> But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
<s> I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
<s> Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
<s> Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
<s> Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
<s> Leave to carry on, sir, please?
<s> The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
<s> Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
<s> We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
<s> Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
<s> What?
<s> Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
<s> Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
<s> Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
<s> Yes.
<s> Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
<s> You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
<s> Oh, my, yes.
<s> 'Fraid so.
<s> Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
<s> It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
<s> Wouldn't dream of it.
<s> Twenty five?
<s> ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
<s> So?
<s> No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
<s> He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
<s> Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
<s> What's your name?
<s> You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
<s> Jesus, what is with this guy?
<s> I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
<s> ...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
<s> ...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
<s> Yeah, yeah, sorry...
<s> Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
<s> Me, specifically?
<s> Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
<s> I'm cool.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm trying...
<s> Who was he?
<s> Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
<s> I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
<s> It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
<s> I'm...what?  Sorry?
<s> That what we're doing?  Flowing?
<s> I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
<s> Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> It's not bullshit.
<s> Doesn't cover everything.
<s> In case <u>who</u> checks?
<s> Dmitri?
<s> He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
<s> No.  No way.  I can't do this.
<s> No.
<s> Who?
<s> Answer the question.
<s> Let her go.
<s> I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
<s> Just drop me off.
<s> Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
<s> Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
<s> Motive?
<s> Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
<s> This would be it?
<s> His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
<s> Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
<s> What?
<s> Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
<s> There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
<s> You go.  Send me a postcard.
<s> Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
<s> Without a love of my own.
<s> Top pocket...  Go on.
<s> That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
<s> We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
<s> Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
<s> Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
<s> A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
<s> We're very specialized.
<s> Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
<s> You do recognize it then?
<s> Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
<s> Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
<s> This doesn't make sense.
<s> I don't know.  Didn't see him.
<s> It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
<s> Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
<s> Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
<s> How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
<s> -- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
<s> Oh?  How's he doing?
<s> Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
<s> No doubt.
<s> David --
<s> We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
<s> You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
<s> Ellie.
<s> Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
<s> What would you have me say, David?
<s> No primer.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
<s> Put it on speakers.
<s> This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
<s> Is that your official response?
<s> Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
<s> On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
<s> Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
<s> Small moves, Captain, small moves.
<s> Many others.
<s> The librarian... or the library...?
<s> Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
<s> Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
<s> A page-break signal.  A period.
<s> You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
<s> It's so... small.
<s> Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
<s> I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
<s> That's what they all say.
<s> 'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
<s> How close are you to getting this funding put together?
<s> I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
<s> That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
<s> That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
<s> And mind, yes.  What are you --
<s> Some of my best friends are scientists.
<s> Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
<s> Something like that.
<s> You're willing to die for this.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm sorry -- I can't --
<s> And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
<s> It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
<s> Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
<s> Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
<s> I'll make it a dollar.
<s> I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
<s> I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
<s> Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
<s> She took off with that convertible feller...
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's good: he earned it.
<s> I don't know, Boss.
<s> Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
<s> Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
<s> Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
<s> You jes' watch us!
<s> Borrowin'.
<s> He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
<s> What for?
<s> But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
<s> Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
<s> That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
<s> Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
<s> Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
<s> We got it locked in the sock.
<s> Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
<s> Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
<s> I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
<s> Take it easy, Drag.
<s> Well, how far didya get?
<s> A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
<s> Give in? That's our Luke out there.
<s> I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
<s> About what?
<s> Hal has it.
<s> 'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
<s> When was that?
<s> And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
<s> You get me out first.
<s> She don't want it.
<s> I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
<s> Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
<s> Where are you, Peter?
<s> No.  Not yet.
<s> I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
<s> Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
<s> You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
<s> This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
<s> He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
<s> Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
<s> You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
<s> The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
<s> MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
<s> I'll get a locksmith.
<s> Why don't you shoot off the lock?
<s> He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
<s> Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
<s> You came in there with this attitude...
<s> Look at her legs.
<s> Right.
<s> Good.
<s> Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
<s> You're damn right I do.
<s> Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
<s> ...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
<s> Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
<s> Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
<s> They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
<s> I'll listen for you buzzing over.
<s> Outside in the visitors, car park.
<s> What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
<s> It does.
<s> No. But when he's in that car...
<s> Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
<s> My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
<s> It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
<s> Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
<s> I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
<s> We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
<s> When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
<s> I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
<s> Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
<s> No.
<s> I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
<s> Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
<s> It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
<s> Yeah, and a dimple.
<s> I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
<s> We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
<s> Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
<s> I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
<s> Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
<s> Really?
<s> Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
<s> Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
<s> Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
<s> Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
<s> I'll be running it three days a week, and...
<s> Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
<s> Come on.
<s> Especially with a promotion in the offing.
<s> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
<s> I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
<s> You too, Mom.
<s> Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
<s> And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
<s> It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
<s> Green spot.
<s> It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
<s> No.
<s> By color.
<s> That must be really difficult.
<s> I wasn't hungry.
<s> Paul.
<s> Very romantic setting.
<s> The left one.
<s> Wow.    I'm bad news.
<s> No way.
<s> Your family just met me.
<s> Do you?
<s> I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
<s> I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
<s> You, too. Kick ass today.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Thanks.
<s> That's Mr. Beast to you.
<s> You got wine. That's great.
<s> You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
<s> You don't have to take care of me, you know.
<s> I think I should call someone.
<s> I guess so.
<s> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
<s> How about something better?   Like a kiss.
<s> Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
<s> Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
<s> I think we need to talk about some things.
<s> This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
<s> I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
<s> You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
<s> Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
<s> Oh.
<s> I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
<s> You killed her!
<s> They don't have a murder weapon?
<s> Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
<s> You're calling me on is phone?
<s> Oui.
<s> Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
<s> What?
<s> When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
<s> Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
<s> And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
<s> I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
<s> Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
<s> Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
<s> I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
<s> How about if I call you?
<s> And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
<s> Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
<s> Do I?
<s> What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
<s> Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
<s> That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
<s> You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
<s> All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
<s> Has to be.
<s> Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
<s> You better.
<s> I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
<s> There's just one more thing I need you to do.
<s> French guys?    You mean like from France?
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.
<s> I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
<s> You can use my car.
<s> I see.   A master criminal.
<s> C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
<s> It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> How?
<s> Cool.
<s> What?
<s> It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
<s> We don't know that for sure.
<s> Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
<s> It's for you.
<s> How's the arm?  Still sore?
<s> Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
<s> I owe you nothing.
<s> I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
<s> Long.
<s> I heard you met Shu Lien today.
<s> Don't invite danger into your father's house.
<s> You're too young to understand.
<s> Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
<s> You're probably right.
<s> Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
<s> Come and get it if you can.
<s> Not another lecture!  On guard!
<s> "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
<s> During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
<s> Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
<s> Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
<s> It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
<s> My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
<s> I knew she would intrigue you.
<s> Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
<s> What about you?
<s> Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
<s> I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
<s> Father!
<s> Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
<s> Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
<s> I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
<s> This is special, darlin'.  Please?
<s> You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
<s> This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
<s> You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
<s> Fun -- look at that guy...
<s> Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
<s> I have to go.
<s> A remembrance.  A closure.
<s> She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
<s> I don't know you.
<s> Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
<s> A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
<s> Leave me alone -- !
<s> Go away.
<s> 18k.  Crap.
<s> Kill a dead guy?
<s> Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
<s> "Our" Crow...?
<s> That's right.
<s> Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
<s> From who?
<s> Forever.
<s> On my mother's life.
<s> No.
<s> You did?
<s> That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
<s> Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
<s> Thank you.
<s> You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
<s> Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
<s> It's my house.
<s> No thank you.
<s> Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
<s> How about tonight?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
<s> You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
<s> Who's Monsieur Philipe?
<s> I thought you said we were going to be friends.
<s> That's not fair.
<s> I think that's for the best.
<s> Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
<s> Get off me.
<s> Hi.
<s> Schwarz. Jewish?
<s> Doesn't ring a bell.
<s> - none taken -
<s> I don't think that bothered him.
<s> I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
<s> He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
<s> Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
<s> Best friends.
<s> It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
<s> Well... not exactly.
<s> I did?
<s> It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
<s> You promised to let me kiss you.
<s> Is it me?
<s> I know.
<s> I do.
<s> Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
<s> You do?
<s> Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
<s> Get out of here.
<s> Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
<s> And this happened before you and I hooked up?
<s> In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
<s> Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
<s> Could you be more desperate to read it?
<s> You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
<s> What's your plan of attack?
<s> Have you succeeded in your task?
<s> Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
<s> What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
<s> Take a look for yourself.
<s> And that's why you're losing your bet?
<s> Kind of.
<s> Mock, mock, mock.
<s> What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
<s> Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
<s> I have a flair for drama.
<s> Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
<s> Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
<s> Yes, you already did.
<s> We played backgammon?
<s> Nope.
<s> It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
<s> Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
<s> Oh, lots of times.
<s> On the back street  a green house
<s> I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
<s> What's her name?
<s> Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
<s> I think I should.  3000W?
<s> I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
<s> I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
<s> Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
<s> I suppose so.
<s> I live right here.
<s> Yes, daddy.
<s> I didn't forget.
<s> It was on account of the birthday party.
<s> It was just a voice.
<s> This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
<s> Because she is my friend.
<s> You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
<s> For as long as you'll let me.
<s> For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
<s> It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
<s> Yes, Amy.
<s> Will you come soon?
<s> I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
<s> But what happened to the little deer?
<s> Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
<s> Look at me.
<s> The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
<s> It was pale...a shadowed gold.
<s> Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
<s> Now, I don't know Amy --
<s> Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
<s> Come away, Amy.
<s> I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
<s> Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
<s> Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
<s> She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
<s> Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
<s> So don't look in his eyes.
<s> Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
<s> What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
<s> Frida, grab that red one.
<s> Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
<s> Holy shit, I'm a freak.
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> Rule one: always wear make-up.
<s> Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
<s> It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
<s> It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
<s> There is a man's arm in my bed.
<s> I put it down the garbage disposal.
<s> It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
<s> Did you get rid of Mark?
<s> You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
<s> Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
<s> Peter keeps asking me out.
<s> Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
<s> Guess she never found true love.
<s> No. I won't let you do that.
<s> We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
<s> Yes I do have to pee!
<s> You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
<s> So pay them back and apologize.
<s> Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
<s> That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
<s> No really, I love knowing what people read.
<s> Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
<s> Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
<s> Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
<s> I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
<s> Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
<s> I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
<s> They do? Oh no...
<s> Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
<s> I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
<s> Oh, I see... interesting theory.
<s> Packages of money.
<s> Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
<s> It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
<s> She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
<s> We're just trying to figure out what happened.
<s> We can just take this pillowcase.
<s> He's been running money for the Mafia.
<s> Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
<s> She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
<s> Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
<s> Like a vampire or some shit?
<s> Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
<s> Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
<s> What makes her think that?
<s> Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
<s> Not really...
<s> Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
<s> Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
<s> Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
<s> Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
<s> I see...
<s> How could you have been so stupid?
<s> Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
<s> I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
<s> Why are they after you?
<s> Don't know much, do you?
<s> It sure isn't the fun-fair.
<s> No.  Have a look.
<s> Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
<s> You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
<s> Maybe.
<s> Not that again...
<s> I'm...  being...  punished.
<s> It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
<s> No more than the usual.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
<s> Fine.
<s> The guy's in a coma, Bob.
<s> Yes.
<s> I was a senator, you know.
<s> Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
<s> He's only doing what you told him to.
<s> Bob...
<s> It's fine.
<s> It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
<s> I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
<s> I'm not sure... I might have.
<s> Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
<s> But we went there.  We saw those kids.
<s> Wrong...
<s> Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Dirty business we're in sometimes.
<s> He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
<s> Really?
<s> First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
<s> Thanks, Duane.
<s> Go tuck yourself, Bill.
<s> Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
<s> I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
<s> Anybody would have done it.
<s> Oh yeah?  Me, too.
<s> Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
<s> It's just more than anybody else does around here.
<s> I know.
<s> I can't.
<s> I know.
<s> What about the intro?
<s> No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
<s> Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
<s> Come on.
<s> ...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
<s> That sounds like a curse to me.
<s> Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
<s> You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
<s> Datura.
<s> We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
<s> It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
<s> Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
<s> The hospital? 
<s> We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
<s> You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
<s> God....damn you, Rhodes!
<s> Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
<s> Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
<s> We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
<s> For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
<s> In the battle, sir.
<s> Well, no shit, Sherlock
<s> I don't think they're in school.
<s> How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
<s> Oh come on, Pitts...
<s> I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
<s> Why? Nobody knows who we are.
<s> I think you're sweet.
<s> No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
<s> Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
<s> Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
<s> Sort of.
<s> No.
<s> Knox!  what are you doing here?
<s> All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
<s> Are you going with Chet?
<s> My Word
<s> Carpe Diem... seize the day.
<s> Meeks.
<s> Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
<s> Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
<s> I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
<s> A barbaric yawp.
<s> His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
<s> I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
<s> God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
<s> Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
<s> Where is this cave he's talking about?
<s> What is it?
<s> I'll take him over mine.
<s> Nothing.
<s> A play, dummy.
<s> So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
<s> Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
<s> I'll come to the performance.
<s> Yes.
<s> Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
<s> I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
<s> I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
<s> And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
<s> I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
<s> Did you clear this?
<s> ...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
<s> Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
<s> Well, you sure do a good imitation.
<s> Hey! I didn't have to come back.
<s> You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
<s> Keep tasting...
<s> Not like him.
<s> Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
<s> Joey...
<s> What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
<s> Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
<s> How does an island sound to you?
<s> Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
<s> A passenger...
<s> What is it man?
<s> 'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
<s> Those are mine!
<s> Damn right!
<s> John,we're going huntin'.
<s> Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
<s> You're full of shit.
<s> I know, but...
<s> Couple of weeks... Listen --
<s> You mean...?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
<s> Everybody love Linda.
<s> I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
<s> How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
<s> Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
<s> Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
<s> Nick, she won't say why.
<s> Will you marry me?
<s> Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
<s> Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
<s> That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
<s> We... Three bullets.
<s> This is horrible!
<s> Right here.
<s> Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Huh?
<s> What do you think?
<s> You're right... Okay, you're right.
<s> Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
<s> What do you mean, no???
<s> See you Monday.
<s> Listen, Nick --
<s> Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
<s> I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
<s> Phantom Mary?
<s> Down.
<s> Up.
<s> Technothugs?
<s> Wade did a little reminiscing.
<s> He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
<s> No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
<s> Put that on your political resume.
<s> Later.  I want Doucet first.
<s> I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
<s> Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
<s> I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
<s> I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
<s> I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
<s> It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
<s> Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
<s> Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
<s> There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
<s> You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
<s> No, sir.
<s> How ya feeling?
<s> ...What are you talking about...?
<s> He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
<s> From over the mountain --
<s> No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
<s> No, thank you -- what's your name?
<s> Thank you, Belle --
<s> That's my problem, Belle.
<s> Guess there will, if it says so.
<s> Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
<s> I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
<s> Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
<s> Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
<s> You are afraid!
<s> But what becomes of our souls?
<s> The seventh day of April --
<s> He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
<s> I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
<s> No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
<s> Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
<s> Well, I --
<s> Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
<s> Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
<s> Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
<s> Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
<s> Who is it?
<s> It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
<s> Jabez ...
<s> I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
<s> Isn't that your own fault?
<s> It shows on your face.
<s> I don't know, Jabez.
<s> Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
<s> That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
<s> Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
<s> I say -- it don't matter.
<s> Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
<s> The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
<s> You aren't angry with me?
<s> Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
<s> Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
<s> Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
<s> Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
<s> Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
<s> It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
<s> Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
<s> I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
<s> I object.
<s> The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
<s> Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
<s> Married.
<s> You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
<s> It's corny, but I could live with it.
<s> They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
<s> How about his job?
<s> Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
<s> Okay.
<s> Who are you, then?
<s> When you're hot, you're hot.
<s> Sure.  Follow me.
<s> Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
<s> Yeah.  I remember our first date.
<s> I'm ahead of you...partner.
<s> Two?  Are you sure?
<s> Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
<s> Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
<s> I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
<s> Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
<s> Then who the hell have you been talking too?
<s> What about the kids?
<s> Heidi, I'm dying.
<s> Yeah, well I don't blame him.
<s> Hello, Sonny.
<s> Yeah.  So how are you?
<s> What trip?
<s> Where you gonna go?
<s> He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
<s> That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
<s> Right.  See you sometime.
<s> Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
<s> Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
<s> Oh no!
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
<s> Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
<s> ... armed robbery ...
<s> They were ...
<s> Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
<s> What else?
<s> Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
<s> Sal, get 'em in the vault.
<s> They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
<s> I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
<s> I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
<s> They look like good kids.
<s> Why not?
<s> You were terrific, too!
<s> You stopped?  Why?
<s> You're serious!
<s> Yes...
<s> Let's go, Sonny.
<s> How'd that happen?
<s> All right ... send them the guard.
<s> What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
<s> Does that still go?
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Everybody!  Back here!
<s> Get over there!
<s> They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
<s> No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
<s> Okay, when do I get them?
<s> What can he do, he's clean...
<s> Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
<s> What about your toe?

<s> We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
<s> Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
<s> Coming.
<s> I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
<s> Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.

<s> Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
<s> Wanna bet?
<s> Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
<s> Yes.
<s> Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
<s> HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
<s> Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
<s> I know I did.
<s> D2.
<s> You thinking what I'm thinking?
<s> Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
<s> Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
<s> That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
<s> Try one in a million!
<s> I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
<s> Oh, you're good.
<s> Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
<s> Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.

<s> You know, "some". The fag stuff.
<s> I know, you want go for a ride.
<s> Oh, go on.
<s> So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
<s> That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
<s> Looks like the best man won.
<s> LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
<s> "My dream date with Principal Collins."
<s> You were born free and free you should remain.
<s> Duh. I'm in your class at school.
<s> I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Skateboard.
<s> Go in there and get us two slushees.
<s> He passed away three years ago.
<s> So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
<s> Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
<s> Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
<s> How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
<s> Who's there?
<s> Just like the President.
<s> No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
<s> JESSICA. Are you sure?
<s> Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
<s> The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...

<s> The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
<s> What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
<s> SILENCE... SILENCE.
<s> You feel the flesh crisping?
<s> Where?
<s> It is my home.
<s> I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
<s> Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andtruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Do you want me to get it for you?
<s> Who do I play?
<s> So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
<s> Dracula?
<s> Ah!  This is very exciting.
<s> Goulash.
<s> "Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
<s> I never said I could ad-lib...
<s> Mmph?  Where am I?
<s> So why didn't you do it?
<s> But maybe not.
<s> You'll be fighting with the octopus.
<s> Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
<s> Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
<s> Don't you want a second take, for protection?
<s> Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
<s> I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
<s> Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
<s> Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
<s> So did you get his autograph?
<s> Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
<s> Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
<s> Toss us out on our ass.
<s> Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
<s> Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
<s> Like <u>what</u>?!
<s> I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
<s> Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
<s> Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
<s> Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
<s> That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
<s> Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
<s> Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
<s> Hruphh...?
<s> It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
<s> Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<s> No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
<s> But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
<s> But Greta say --
<s> Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
<s> So you're not gonna make the movie?
<s> You gotta be kiddin' me.
<s> Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
<s> Who?
<s> I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
<s> Oh.  My condolences.
<s> This is my thirteenth pair.
<s> Oh, hi.
<s> I am.  How's your father?
<s> I just picked them up on the way over...
<s> Huh?
<s> The poor girl's out of a job.
<s> The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
<s> I don't know.
<s> Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
<s> Yes!
<s> Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
<s> Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
<s> Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
<s> Do they show it?
<s> No! Do they show you having sex?
<s> Yeah. Ma...
<s> Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
<s> Al!!
<s> This is real, Bananahead!
<s> You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
<s> What if Shari's the dream?
<s> Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
<s> I'm not sure about the entire concept.
<s> Yes?
<s> Thank you. Can I see her?
<s> Mm...  Oh, man...
<s> Really? They were..
<s> No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Oh.
<s> No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
<s> Yes to me or yes to the coil?
<s> Holy sh--
<s> The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
<s> Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
<s> Mom?
<s> I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
<s> Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
<s> Ma...
<s> She left.
<s> It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
<s> What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
<s> Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
<s> Who's in it?
<s> Welcome to work, Ed.
<s> I hear the dog really liked him.
<s> Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
<s> I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
<s> So maybe this is my dynamite.
<s> It's... okay
<s> Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
<s> Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
<s> The what?
<s> Really? 
<s> Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
<s> ...yeah?
<s> No... Could you?
<s> What?
<s> Everybody's someone.
<s> What?
<s> What is?!
<s> Thumbsucker!
<s> No. What happened?
<s> Ray --
<s> Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
<s> I know.
<s> I love you! 1 want to marry you!
<s> Hi.
<s> Hi.
<s> Thanks... That's ...
<s> Ed?
<s> What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
<s> That's the point -- this could change things.
<s> Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
<s> He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Dick.
<s> I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
<s> Ethics are...
<s> Aren't you supposed to keep them?
<s> You bet.
<s> Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
<s> Sure
<s> Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
<s> Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
<s> That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
<s> Hello, Tracy.
<s> Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes?
<s> You will.
<s> Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
<s> Oh yeah, you bet.
<s> Uh, Jim?
<s> Walt needs to see you.
<s> Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
<s> I don't know. All I know is I did it I
<s> Should we get a what?
<s> We'll let it run awhile
<s> It's the only true thing I know anymore.
<s> I also like bananas.
<s> Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
<s> Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
<s> And 290 "disregards," right?
<s> What?
<s> So?
<s> I don't care.
<s> It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
<s> Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
<s> Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
<s> Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
<s> It's not what you think.
<s> Yeah, plain scotch.
<s> Are you sorry she's dead?
<s> So tell me about it.
<s> No.  Now.  You fucked him.
<s> Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
<s> Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
<s> How?
<s> How'd you get them to retract?
<s> You've got it, Wendell.
<s> What work?
<s> Let my daughter rest in peace.
<s> Stens?  Was it Stens?
<s> The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
<s> They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
<s> Let's just kill them.
<s> A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
<s> Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
<s> Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
<s> And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
<s> More.
<s> He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
<s> Susan Lefferts.
<s> Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
<s> I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
<s> All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
<s> Clean?
<s> I never truck with no sissies!
<s> Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
<s> In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
<s> Answer yes or no.
<s> White's a mindless thug.
<s> It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
<s> I'll break them, sir.
<s> Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
<s> Why?
<s> And now you'll provide them.
<s> You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
<s> No.
<s> I want you to follow Bud White.
<s> Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
<s> What?
<s> With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
<s> Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
<s> Bud White's been here?
<s> Why's she seeing Bud White?
<s> Not good enough.
<s> I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
<s> He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
<s> Why?
<s> Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
<s> Some reality.
<s> Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
<s> I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
<s> Sid, cut the crap.  I --
<s> You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
<s> It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
<s> Be careful, Danny.
<s> Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
<s> I called my wife!
<s> Jesus. Do you have proof?
<s> Oh my God...
<s> Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> <u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
<s> What if--
<s> What if we just fucked with 'em?
<s> Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
<s> I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
<s> C'mon.
<s> The thing is...it really can't wait.
<s> What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Are you sure about this?
<s> Neil, thank you for your help.
<s> Hello. Hello, Maria.
<s> Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
<s> I'll say.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Okay.
<s> Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
<s> I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
<s> No.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Just for the criminals.
<s> No.
<s> Well, you know--
<s> I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
<s> It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
<s> Stacy--
<s> Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
<s> This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
<s> What happened to your head?
<s> That was for Christmas.
<s> What is it?
<s> That's gonna end tonight.
<s> Albert's gonna get me my job back.
<s> It's a brand new card.
<s> Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
<s> That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
<s> That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
<s> It tastes like fish.
<s> I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
<s> Brill.
<s> Yes.
<s> Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
<s> You're not.
<s> Who's doing this?
<s> The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> I'm sorry about that.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
<s> Merry Christmas, son.
<s> You're firing me.
<s> L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
<s> That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
<s> Where's mom?
<s> Christ!
<s> Calm down.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Why would they--
<s> Listen to me.
<s> I have a family.
<s> You remember Daniel Zavitz?
<s> Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
<s> You would?
<s> It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
<s> Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
<s> Lyle?!
<s> You're kidding me.
<s> The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
<s> I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
<s> I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
<s> Hello!  Good morning.
<s> Pardon?
<s> I'm quite all right, thank you.
<s> See what's happening to them - the stars.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.  Absolutely.
<s> Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
<s> No, but I think I do.
<s> A lie.  What do you hate most?
<s> What?  No!
<s> It's a long song - Szerelem means loveand the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
<s> You bastard, I was believing you!
<s> This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
<s> Would you let me pass?
<s> You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
<s> No.
<s> Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
<s> Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
<s> Still a car.
<s> Appropriate?
<s> Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
<s> Sorry, what's your point?
<s> What?
<s> I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
<s> No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
<s> I told you so.
<s> Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
<s> Okay.
<s> It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
<s> So was my Patient.
<s> Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
<s> I liberated it.
<s> What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
<s> Very true!
<s> Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
<s> Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
<s> Candaules
<s> No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
<s> Are you remembering more?
<s> Because I'm a nurse.
<s> Well then - yes.  Of course.
<s> Why?  Is he staying?
<s> The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
<s> Is something funny?
<s> There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
<s> You loved him.
<s> I try not to expect you.
<s> It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
<s> A bit of one.
<s> Go away.
<s> This is making me incredibly angry.
<s> I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
<s> This was your garden?
<s> Bingo.
<s> You got a better idea?
<s> Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
<s> We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
<s> Not a word.
<s> It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
<s> Give him the card.
<s> That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
<s> Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
<s> I never carry...baggage.
<s> No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
<s> Good morning.
<s> It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
<s> We're doing this together. We're partners.
<s> No. It's a down payment.
<s> We are...for the tools.
<s> Try laps. Say a hundred.
<s> Our equipment has arrived.
<s> It was a long time ago.
<s> Thank you.
<s> When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
<s> So you had to be your own lifeline.
<s> It's a party.
<s> Got it.
<s> No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
<s> Yes. Yes.
<s> Get the hell in.
<s> Everything.
<s> There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
<s> My job, my rules.
<s> And the money goes--
<s> You've thought of everything.
<s> I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
<s> Like a woman of mystery.
<s> What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
<s> We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
<s> I'm not leaving without you.
<s> But--
<s> My god--
<s> Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
<s> Which is--
<s> This is big enough.
<s> I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
<s> Suspicious, after all these years?
<s> You damn well thought wrong.
<s> Check out my ball.
<s> She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
<s> You're giving them to me?
<s> Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
<s> We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
<s> What do you think?  What's this?
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
<s> So you say.
<s> An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
<s> Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
<s> Yes?
<s> Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
<s> Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
<s> They did?
<s> Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
<s> ... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
<s> If you hadn't used profanity --
<s> I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
<s> Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
<s> So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
<s> So you think we got 'em scared?
<s> Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
<s> Really?  It makes me sick.
<s> From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
<s> They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
<s> I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
<s> No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
<s> Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
<s> It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
<s> Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
<s> Not in my world.
<s> No one's taking anything --
<s> I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
<s> Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
<s> <u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
<s> "I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
<s> Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
<s> Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
<s> Did he say why?
<s> Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
<s> And ...?
<s> Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
<s> Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
<s> How come you're not eating?
<s> So did I.
<s> Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
<s> No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
<s> I do.
<s> I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
<s> I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
<s> Better safe than sorry.
<s> I'm just saying --
<s> Nothing.
<s> What's that?
<s> Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
<s> I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
<s> I'm real sorry, Laura.
<s> Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
<s> He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
<s> Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
<s> You did?
<s> He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
<s> Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
<s> Barks his agreement.
<s> Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
<s> Barks his agreement.
<s> Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
<s> It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
<s> Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
<s> Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
<s> Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
<s> The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
<s> Me?  I don't know what you mean.
<s> I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
<s> Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
<s> Or you ran into something ....
<s> To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
<s> Where?
<s> The entrance is collapsing!
<s> Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
<s> I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
<s> Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
<s> Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
<s> I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
<s> Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
<s> Not yet.  They're working on it now.
<s> I thought you knew this person.
<s> No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
<s> The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
<s> Believe what?
<s> They look pretty docile.
<s> With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
<s> Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
<s> Go on now. Do as I say.
<s> You told me he was dead.
<s> Where?
<s> Not anymore.
<s> Don't lie to me.
<s> We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
<s> Somebody get off!
<s> Can you land?
<s> You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
<s> And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
<s> Having second thoughts?
<s> I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
<s> There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
<s> All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
<s> Right over there.
<s> We'll see.
<s> They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
<s> I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
<s> Find Cuervo Jones.
<s> Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
<s> Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
<s> Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
<s> I gave up my castles and my lands!
<s> I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
<s> I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
<s> Speak of the devil!...
<s> In the great book.
<s> ...of course...
<s> There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
<s> That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
<s> Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
<s> You freed it, son?
<s> --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
<s> The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
<s> You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
<s> Yes. I would swear my love to you.
<s> Love demands it.
<s> --It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
<s> No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
<s> Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
<s> --I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
<s> One land, one king! That is my peace!
<s> Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
<s> Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
<s> I didn't know that.
<s> I see, your excellency.
<s> You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
<s> Maybe the circuit is busy?
<s> No, she was heavily sedated.
<s> We still don't know.
<s> I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
<s> Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
<s> Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
<s> Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
<s> No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
<s> Sure did.
<s> The priest.
<s> Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
<s> Could you see her?
<s> Yes I did, I'm sorry.
<s> In Europe.
<s> I found it.
<s> No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
<s> I wouldn't talk.
<s> Do you not like him like daddy?
<s> So something please Doctor, Help her!
<s> Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
<s> That's good.
<s> So what's wrong with her?
<s> So what's next?
<s> Oh, Christ.
<s> Sure.
<s> That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
<s> You and us.
<s> In time.
<s> Bon Jour.
<s> Who are you?
<s> How's your leg?
<s> Oh really, when?
<s> No momma.
<s> Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
<s> I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
<s> ... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
<s> Very much.
<s> That's to bad.
<s> O'Lord hear my prey.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Why not?
<s> We don't need you, Frankie.
<s> It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
<s> Swimming trunks.
<s> They're falling out.
<s> Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
<s> The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
<s> Two at a time?
<s> Oh.
<s> Get your hand off me.
<s> Recognize these two characters?
<s> In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
<s> Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
<s> You look like you just crawled out of bed.
<s> Lotta water.
<s> Fuck him.
<s> Fuck him.
<s> Why the interest?
<s> It's me.
<s> Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
<s> You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
<s> No.
<s> Let's get it over with.
<s> I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
<s> Come on, stand still.
<s> And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
<s> You wanna get a drink?
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Because I can hear it.
<s> Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
<s> What?
<s> Huh?
<s> Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
<s> Yeah.
<s> You could've come.
<s> The tenth's out.
<s> Just until we find another girl.
<s> You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
<s> I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
<s> I don't know. Some disease.
<s> Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
<s> I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
<s> It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
<s> No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
<s> This'll kill 'em.
<s> Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
<s> I can keep the beat.
<s> Five years ago.  November.
<s> She asked for it.
<s> All right.
<s> Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
<s> When we know.
<s> Where's my name?
<s> Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
<s> Big feet.
<s> They're nines.
<s> Switch?  What fucking switch?
<s> First times. Hey, look at this.
<s> Tell her.
<s> People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
<s> He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
<s> No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
<s> I'll call you.
<s> Born and bred.
<s> Job.
<s> The name's Baker --
<s> Black.  Labrador.
<s> He'll come around.
<s> His kid's sick.
<s> Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
<s> You want me to walk you?
<s> I guess in case one year they're not.
<s> In and out.
<s> Hey, business is business.
<s> Just dinner and dance, right?
<s> Guess I got a little scattered.
<s> Better than that.
<s> I'm not upset.
<s> Who's Nina?
<s> Ed? How many people live here?
<s> How come you didn't close your eyes?
<s> No kidding?
<s> Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
<s> Yeah.  Got my own sign.
<s> You don't pick your brother.
<s> He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
<s> Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
<s> You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
<s> Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
<s> Should be.  It's yours.
<s> You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
<s> Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
<s> You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
<s> A few blanks?  Like what?
<s> We need to talk.
<s> Something good?
<s> So you had a nightmare.
<s> Were you there to catch me?
<s> An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
<s> Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
<s> Jon, what is it?
<s> He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
<s> You said it, Jon, not me.
<s> Shoot him!
<s> What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
<s> Janie?
<s> That's your name, isn't it?
<s> What happened?
<s> What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
<s> You can't blame me for trying.
<s> No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
<s> There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
<s> Don't I usually kiss my wife?
<s> So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
<s> The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
<s> Great.
<s> I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
<s> That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
<s> Good.  Because I'm fed up.
<s> Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
<s> Ooh, my suits are ready...
<s> Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
<s> On a case by case basis...
<s> I think I could figure it out.
<s> Check...
<s> Is it...?
<s> Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
<s> Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
<s> Pretty much.
<s> Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
<s> We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
<s> Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
<s> Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
<s> Me?
<s> Thats my car!  You stole my car!
<s> Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
<s> You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!
<s> Give me my goddamn life back!
<s> You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.
<s> You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
<s> Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
<s> It would help me if we were.
<s> Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
<s> No, I didnt...thats great.
<s> If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
<s> Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
<s> I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
<s> I was in the city.
<s> Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
<s> Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
<s> Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
<s> No, shes not.
<s> I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
<s> I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
<s> No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
<s> Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
<s> Its good, right?
<s> Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
<s> Thats all I wanted to hear...
<s> A perk for what?
<s> Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
<s> Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
<s> Thats the one...
<s> We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
<s> You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
<s> Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
<s> You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
<s> Hey, are you okay?
<s> Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
<s> Five times.
<s> This makes five.
<s> He's made a few changes.
<s> <u>Should</u>?
<s> Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
<s> Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
<s> I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
<s> Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
<s> Give me the god damn mirror!
<s> Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
<s> Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
<s> What is this?  Where's Reed?
<s> It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
<s> It's easy for you to be patient.
<s> Ben!  Ben!
<s> You've been working out.
<s> They're not costumes.
<s> Stay right.  Left is trouble.
<s> Okay, "mom."
<s> I think that thing is Ben.
<s> Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
<s> Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
<s> You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
<s> He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
<s> It's been changed.
<s> You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
<s> That's what we're here to find out.
<s> Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
<s> I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
<s> Just <u>find</u> him.
<s> Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
<s> Susan.  What are you doing?
<s> Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
<s> Here's the overall Target Area...
<s> The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
<s> Brain injury.
<s> <Me>?
<s> Here's the Surgeon.
<s> Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
<s> No question of her loyalty.
<s> They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
<s> Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
<s> We must!
<s> No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
<s> He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
<s> I feel much better now...
<s> Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
<s> Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
<s> Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
<s> As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
<s> Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
<s> We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
<s> Oxygenation...
<s> Then why not take it?
<s> "Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
<s> It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
<s> How are you, Miss Peterson?
<s> Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
<s> A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
<s> They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
<s> We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
<s> I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
<s> Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Sort of.
<s> Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
<s> We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
<s> I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
<s> I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
<s> Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
<s> Certainly.
<s> ...What're you talking about?
<s> No, that's not it, Jerry.
<s> You want your own wife kidnapped?
<s> Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
<s> Oh sure.
<s> Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
<s> Mm.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
<s> Uhn.
<s> They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
<s> No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
<s> They're playin' the Buckeyes!
<s> I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
<s> Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
<s> Sir? Right now?
<s> Dad's here.
<s> Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
<s> Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
<s> Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
<s> Yah, okay.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yah.
<s> A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
<s> 2:30.
<s> Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
<s> Mm.
<s> Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
<s> Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
<s> Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
<s> Yah.
<s> Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
<s> Aw, you can sleep, hon.
<s> Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
<s> Just a Diet Coke.
<s> Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
<s> I always liked ya so much...
<s> It's okay...
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> What'd he say?
<s> His wife?
<s> No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
<s> No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
<s> Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
<s> Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
<s> Oh, fine.
<s> Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
<s> Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
<s> Where's Tyler?
<s> We're still men.
<s> Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
<s> No, I wasn't aware...
<s> Dynamite?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Who do you think could've done this?
<s> I'd like to thank the academy...
<s> You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
<s> Sure.
<s> Should we?
<s> Like testicular cancer?
<s> Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
<s> Can I come in?
<s> Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
<s> Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
<s> You are an insane person.
<s> Don't ask.
<s> I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
<s> Yes... it's a test.
<s> My suitcase was vibrating?
<s> Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
<s> Now, find your power animal.
<s> Yes, you can.
<s> It affords him other interesting opportunities.
<s> Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
<s> Good answer.
<s> Don't mention me.
<s> I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
<s> I don't know...
<s> I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
<s> An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
<s> No.
<s> You know what I mean.
<s> Tyler...
<s> You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
<s> What?
<s> If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
<s> You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
<s> This isn't possible...
<s> You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
<s> It's out of our hands.  This is it.
<s> ... no, no, no...
<s> What?
<s> Very good, Sir.
<s> You told me you'd say that.
<s> No!
<s> We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
<s> No, please, no, God, no!
<s> I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
<s> Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
<s> Signs?
<s> Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
<s> I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
<s> If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
<s> Random, sure.
<s> What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
<s> Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
<s> Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
<s> I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
<s> I've got to stop and help those people.
<s> No.  What's this about?
<s> Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
<s> Yeah?
<s> Like what?
<s> Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
<s> Who is this guy, anyway?
<s> I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
<s> I don't...what if I made a mistake?
<s> I know.  I can feel it too.
<s> Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
<s> Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
<s> Sure.
<s> You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
<s> I know, we'll be there soon.
<s> Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
<s> Thirty-nine.
<s> We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
<s> They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
<s> No! No! Don't!
<s> Why do you think I was hiding?
<s> You're the fuckin' devil.
<s> I know who you are.
<s> You saying Tod did kill himself?
<s> They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
<s> Ninety.
<s> Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
<s> AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
<s> No cigarettes.
<s> Fermented fish sauce.
<s> Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
<s> She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
<s> Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
<s> Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
<s> What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
<s> Duck soup.
<s> Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
<s> Nguyen is good boy.
<s> Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
<s> Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
<s> Not yet.
<s> I was crossed-trained in gunships.
<s> POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
<s> Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
<s> Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
<s> Well, I guess I'll come back then.
<s> Do I look like I have someone special?
<s> I never really...went through a... dating period.
<s> I was attacked.
<s> I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
<s> I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
<s> Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
<s> No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
<s> He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
<s> Tragedy?
<s> Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
<s> It was a crime.
<s> Fine.  I'll say no.
<s> Fine.
<s> Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
<s> Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
<s> Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
<s> Yes.  They're free.
<s> Tonight!  How's tonight?
<s> What girl?  I didn't notice.
<s> Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
<s> I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
<s> Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
<s> No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
<s> Can I take you to lunch?
<s> No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
<s> So what? You going to help me?
<s> Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
<s> Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
<s> Sure...
<s> I know!
<s> No just Parry.
<s> We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
<s> Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
<s> Twinky?
<s> Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
<s> A wig?
<s> Serveza yourself!
<s> If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
<s> What?
<s> I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
<s> Fill it up.
<s> Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
<s> It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
<s> No. How much do I owe you?
<s> But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
<s> Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
<s> Well, you seem very professional...
<s> Now don't...
<s> This is a very special, very old CB 275...
<s> Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
<s> Yeah, me, too...
<s> I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
<s> Uhm hmm. Some range.
<s> Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
<s> You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
<s> Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
<s> Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
<s> Bye, Robert.
<s> Then after that?
<s> None.
<s> Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
<s> Yes, that's what's important to me...
<s> Of course I'd like to.
<s> Oh. You have to tell me that.
<s> Catherine...
<s> All right, let's have a rematch.
<s> Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
<s> Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
<s> It is true.
<s> I hope I didn't hear that.
<s> I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
<s> A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
<s> Steam.
<s> Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
<s> Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
<s> Is it true?
<s> Victor.
<s> Um. Yeah! Shorty!
<s> I just wanted to see you.
<s> Just chill.
<s> You look good.
<s> I can't!
<s> I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
<s> I won't let my motha cut my hair.
<s> Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
<s> Pitt.
<s> C'mon.
<s> Which one?
<s> No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
<s> 'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
<s> Positive.
<s> Positive.
<s> Your friend must be misinformed.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
<s> So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
<s> Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
<s> He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
<s> Fletch, this is dumb.
<s> Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
<s> Go ahead. Make my evening.
<s> We play tennis at the club.
<s> One. B-a-b-a-r.
<s> No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
<s> Well, which one?
<s> Oh, he was dying for years.
<s> Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
<s> No idea.
<s> Okay. Some idea.
<s> Affirmative.
<s> I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
<s> I'm fine.
<s> That's it?
<s> I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
<s> She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
<s> You may be right.
<s> Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
<s> Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
<s> Come on in.
<s> Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> They bust you every week.
<s> What?
<s> What's that?
<s> I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
<s> Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
<s> Yeah. Maybe.
<s> Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
<s> I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
<s> Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
<s> Come inside.
<s> My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
<s> You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
<s> Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
<s> In this drawer....
<s> Precisely. Are you a good shot?
<s> Where am I going?
<s> Sure.
<s> Deal.
<s> Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
<s> It's Scotch-Rumanian.
<s> Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
<s> I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
<s> None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
<s> No. He was. I got him out.
<s> Why did you do it?
<s> So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
<s> What does all this mean?
<s> Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
<s> But I've seen the deed.
<s> Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
<s> I'll take you to a game.
<s> I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
<s> I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
<s> I recommend it.
<s> Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
<s> ...never reads the paper...
<s> I'd say charcoal.
<s> Utah?
<s> I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
<s> In a minute!
<s> But I ain't got you...
<s> No, I ain't got you...
<s> But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
<s> Who?
<s> Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
<s> Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
<s> Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
<s> Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
<s> Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
<s> But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
<s> As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
<s> I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
<s> Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
<s> There's that question...
<s> Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
<s> I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
<s> Twelve pack?
<s> Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
<s> And hey, I appreciate it...
<s> Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
<s> Shut the heck up... Pop.
<s> You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
<s> Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
<s> <u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
<s> Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
<s> Golly, I'd probably faint.
<s> Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<s> I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
<s> Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
<s> What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
<s> Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
<s> You're a poet and didn't know it.
<s> Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
<s> Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
<s> What?
<s> Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
<s> Takin' care o' business, honey.
<s> You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
<s> Fuck you, Santa Claus!
<s> Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
<s> I wasn't looking.
<s> Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
<s> Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
<s> J'ai pas confiance en lui.
<s> Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
<s> I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
<s> Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
<s> How'd I know he had a knife.
<s> He coulda been white.
<s> Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
<s> Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
<s> This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
<s> The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
<s> We put him to bed for the night.
<s> This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
<s> Forty dollars -- was $250.
<s> What is that old building?
<s> For garbage?
<s> Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
<s> Well, I think you do.
<s> That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
<s> Switches are shorted out.
<s> Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
<s> Well, why not a little of the King?
<s> The usual.
<s> Did he?
<s> One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
<s> I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
<s> Luck, my ass.
<s> I think you know, Frank.
<s> Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
<s> Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
<s> Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
<s> Next time lets put some money on it.
<s> I know.  Sorry, Dad.
<s> I got fed up with all the bullshit.
<s> Huh?
<s> Frank...Frank Sullivan.
<s> My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
<s> What?
<s> Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
<s> October 12, 1969.
<s> Tell me.
<s> She's not here.
<s> There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
<s> He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
<s> Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
<s> You really wanna know?
<s> H-hi.
<s> I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
<s> John, he's got my driver's license.
<s> How the hell am I gonna do that?
<s> What...
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
<s> The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
<s> Huh?
<s> I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
<s> Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
<s> Sounds good.
<s> No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
<s> Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
<s> No.  What house you work?
<s> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
<s> I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
<s> Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
<s> If you insist.
<s> I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
<s> What?
<s> I love you, man!
<s> I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
<s> I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
<s> Hello.  How are you?
<s> Is that so bad?
<s> You're irresistible.  I lose control.
<s> Somebody was in here.
<s> Are you all right, Shelly?
<s> It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
<s> My whole world.
<s> Don't say any more.
<s> Damn you, Shelly!
<s> I just want you to like me.
<s> No way...  ...I wanna rock!
<s> I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
<s> Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
<s> I wish it was.
<s> Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
<s> You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
<s> It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
<s> He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
<s> I hope so.
<s> I found it outside.
<s> Why?
<s> Are they grown-ups?
<s> Who ya calling?
<s> Boy scouting.
<s> No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
<s> Will you listen, dammit!
<s> Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
<s> You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
<s> Not so bad, today.
<s> Maybe you should mind your own business.
<s> Her name's Stephanie.
<s> Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
<s> Yeah...
<s> What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
<s> He was dead.  He had to be dead...
<s> The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
<s> I mean really never.
<s> What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
<s> So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
<s> No.
<s> Don't be ridiculous!
<s> Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
<s> That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
<s> Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
<s> He is not.
<s> You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
<s> She didn't push me into coming.
<s> But Sean said...
<s> Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
<s> Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
<s> What do you mean???
<s> Just radio for help, okay???
<s> I'm not going near any lifeboat!
<s> Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
<s> Please, hurry...
<s> That's where I peed.
<s> It's over, finished and done with.
<s> What do I exude?
<s> Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
<s> I say we go.
<s> `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
<s> Does what feel comfortable?
<s> She's dying.
<s> Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
<s> In and out of bed.
<s> This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
<s> I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
<s> There's nothing left for me to lie about.
<s> Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
<s> And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
<s> Two-all after six.
<s> I'd forgotten that.
<s> Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
<s> Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
<s> The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
<s> That's a simple subject.
<s> What am I doing?
<s> Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
<s> It's a simple subject.
<s> Because God loves a winner.
<s> Washed away.
<s> Why does it matter?
<s> I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
<s> When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
<s> Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
<s> That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
<s> I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
<s> Not one of Steven's finer moments.
<s> Engaging.
<s> Alla puttanesca.
<s> I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
<s> The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
<s> And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
<s> They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
<s> In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
<s> I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
<s> I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
<s> Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
<s> He said he's in charge...
<s> No, no -- just a moment, please.
<s> I thought you were against fighting.
<s> I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
<s> Hm.  Is it?
<s> Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
<s> An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
<s> That was England.
<s> It's split the Government.
<s> Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
<s> Somehow I expected not.
<s> I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
<s> ...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
<s> It's over.
<s> You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
<s> By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
<s> No, <i>this</i> is your man.
<s> So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
<s> Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
<s> None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
<s> Blood.  From the vein.
<s> I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
<s> Thank you, no.
<s> What's wrong with him?
<s> Six one.
<s> You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
<s> Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
<s> You know I'm scared of heights.
<s> Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
<s> I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
<s> I've got enough on my mind without that.
<s> If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
<s> Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
<s> Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
<s> What exactly is wrong?
<s> I guess somebody beat me to it.
<s> New policy.
<s> This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
<s> What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
<s> Hi.
<s> I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
<s> That Beynon's got a long arm.
<s> I'm still here, Doc.
<s> It's all right.
<s> Is he straight?
<s> I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
<s> If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
<s> That bad?
<s> Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
<s> I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
<s> She's on TV.
<s> No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
<s> If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
<s> You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
<s> Sure...
<s> I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
<s> Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
<s> You want to try with me?
<s> You and me.
<s> We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
<s> Oh, Jesus... how?
<s> I'll be ready.
<s> Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
<s> I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
<s> Okay. How many bank exits?
<s> I'm good at that.
<s> He took the day off.
<s> Can't leave the desk.
<s> Not now.
<s> 'Bout five thousand.
<s> And I keep my mouth shut?
<s> Can he trust you?
<s> That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
<s> How?
<s> Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
<s> What name?
<s> Jack, you're wrong.
<s> That's nice.
<s> On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
<s> Doreen.
<s> I must go. I'm in a hurry.
<s> I can't.
<s> He was all right to me.
<s> Once a week?
<s> He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
<s> You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
<s> Go on.
<s> While he was here. You went about together?
<s> You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
<s> Entertaining.
<s> No.
<s> No. It's all right.
<s> I left last year.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Right.
<s> Large Scotch.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
<s> Not much.
<s> And that'll make me feel better?
<s> I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
<s> That's all right, Eric.
<s> Still got a sense of humour?
<s> Can't say I do.
<s> You should have told me who you were working for.
<s> Not till I'm dead, Eric.
<s> Piss off, Ray.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We've got to take you back to London.
<s> Shut up.
<s> They came in and they, you know...
<s> They killed the goose.
<s> And now...
<s> Some contest board...
<s> Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
<s> No, it's not that simple, Dave...
<s> What?
<s> What hard part?
<s> That's right...
<s> That's the truth...
<s> They...
<s> No, we're just...
<s> Well.  Well...
<s> Have I said that?
<s> For five thousand?
<s> You're saying "me."
<s> You have to steal the leads tonight?
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> What if you don't get caught?
<s> Yes.  I'm sure.
<s> ...and rob the place...
<s> You went for it.
<s> Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
<s> Yes.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
<s> It's a waste of time.
<s> You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
<s> What?
<s> Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
<s> Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
<s> Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
<s> How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
<s> I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
<s> Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
<s> ...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
<s> ...then...
<s> ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
<s> I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
<s> ...they kicked out.
<s> Good.  Now we're talking.
<s> Now.  Yes...When?
<s> I have to go... 
<s> That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
<s> The deal still stands, our other thing.
<s> What does that fucking mean?
<s> What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Well, hadn't it?
<s> Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
<s> I don't know what you are saying.
<s> That was easy, wasn't it?
<s> No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
<s> Eighty-two thousand dollars.
<s> Fuck is that supposed to mean?
<s> Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
<s> Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
<s> The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
<s> Which...
<s> Uh...
<s> Twelve-fifteen.
<s> Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
<s> Kenilworth...?
<s> Kenilworth.
<s> Gimlet.
<s> She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
<s> I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
<s> But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
<s> This.
<s> It's nothing.
<s> Some of them...
<s> I'm giving you three leads.  You...
<s> Three.
<s> Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
<s> She couldn't decide.
<s> I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
<s> Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
<s> I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
<s> Let's go.
<s> No.
<s> It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
<s> Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
<s> There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
<s> Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
<s> Beautiful.
<s> In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
<s> Chi?
<s> I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
<s> How long does this go on?
<s> Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
<s> We don't know that's true, he never said that.
<s> The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
<s> Yeah, give me a minute.
<s> Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
<s> It was a boy.
<s> I know he's in Israel.
<s> Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
<s> Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
<s> He's going to try Panama...
<s> Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
<s> Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
<s> Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
<s> Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
<s> We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
<s> I don't think that's necessary.
<s> This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
<s> Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
<s> At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
<s> You haven't heard me.
<s> Not for a few years.
<s> The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
<s> I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
<s> Let him gamble.
<s> Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
<s> I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
<s> It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
<s> Some water.
<s> We got friends in the commission.
<s> What about Michael Corleone?
<s> What was that?
<s> What's to be jealous of?
<s> It never crossed your mind?
<s> All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
<s> Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
<s> Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
<s> He is dead now, twenty years.
<s> No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
<s> I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
<s> It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
<s> Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
<s> Mornin'.
<s> Boone.  Clayton Boone.
<s> But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
<s> Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
<s> You mean, like posed for pictures?
<s> Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
<s> And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
<s> You don't say?  Which picture?
<s> I'm not wearing an undershirt.
<s> All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
<s> Sounds like something you feed the dog.
<s> I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
<s> You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
<s> I'm not, you know.
<s> What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
<s> It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
<s> But we have to match the other sketch.
<s> I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
<s> You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
<s> You're talking through your hat now.
<s> Something happened to him?
<s> Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
<s> Catch my death.
<s> No.  Definitely not.
<s> You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
<s> The Great War?
<s> That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
<s> I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
<s> You're crazy.
<s> Ooooh.
<s> If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
<s> The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
<s> I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
<s> "The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
<s> You only embarrass yourself.
<s> You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
<s> You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
<s> Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
<s> Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
<s> Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
<s> She is beautiful.
<s> I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
<s> Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
<s> How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
<s> What rumors might those be?
<s> I guess.
<s> He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
<s> I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
<s> I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
<s> Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
<s> Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
<s> Six years ...
<s> Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
<s> They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
<s> "don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
<s> I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
<s> Get out of here, then. Now.
<s> I don't think so, Detective ...
<s> Your girl works in there ...
<s> Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
<s> You know where the others are?
<s> And there she is --
<s> It's arright ...
<s> Dignity...
<s> There's no one left ...
<s> No.
<s> I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
<s> You remember that, Kip?
<s> Yeah... You want a ride...
<s> Don't go there, Toby --
<s> Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
<s> About what?
<s> What?
<s> I can handle it --
<s> I can handle it --
<s> You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
<s> How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
<s> Thank-you ...
<s> Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
<s> Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
<s> Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
<s> Where we going -- ?
<s> Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
<s> What's wrong with her -- ?
<s> That what you want?
<s> Okay.
<s> No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
<s> I think so... They're just... So ...
<s> Of course you are. You're a professional...
<s> And Tracy's on the move ...
<s> How is he -- ?
<s> Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
<s> Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
<s> Of course. Hi, Junie --
<s> It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
<s> He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
<s> No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
<s> Billy, how are you?
<s> What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
<s> Me? Why would I get into that shit?
<s> Nods.
<s> But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
<s> Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
<s> What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
<s> It'll be okay.
<s> I can't do it anymore.
<s> Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
<s> It's been six months.
<s> Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
<s> Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
<s> I can't make any more deliveries.
<s> My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
<s> You're some fucking jerk.
<s> Yeah, yeah.
<s> Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
<s> There's a shovel at my mother's.
<s> Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
<s> That's important.
<s> Please?
<s> Yeah.
<s> That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
<s> Suck my cock!
<s> Next week.
<s> Probation, counselin', few days a week.
<s> Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
<s> Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
<s> So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
<s> What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
<s> Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
<s> I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
<s> All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
<s> I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
<s> Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
<s> Why don't you beat off at your house?
<s> Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
<s> --These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
<s> I have about seventy-three...
<s> History.
<s> Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
<s> Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
<s> That's one aspect of what we do.
<s> Down there.  And I'm nervous.
<s> Well, he didn't show up for work today...
<s> Really?
<s> What're those?
<s> Of course.
<s> Half-red, half-black--
<s> I don't know what it's called.
<s> I'm pretty sure it's right.
<s> I did.
<s> Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
<s> I got your card.
<s> --That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
<s> They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
<s> It's on the college.
<s> I been here a couple years.
<s> Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
<s> Sean, I really don't think you understand--
<s> --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
<s> Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
<s> --Gerry--
<s> Hold on!
<s> He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
<s> Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
<s> Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
<s> --And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
<s> That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
<s> I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
<s> I don't know. India maybe.
<s> I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
<s> The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
<s> Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
<s> Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
<s> C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
<s> Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
<s> Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
<s> What did you think?
<s> You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
<s> I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
<s> Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
<s> Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
<s> What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
<s> Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
<s> Define that.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're not going to fail me are you?
<s> It sure ain't good.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
<s> I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
<s> What?
<s> See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
<s> It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
<s> So you just want to use me and go?
<s> No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
<s> Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
<s> Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
<s> Your house must have been a zoo.
<s> 'Cause it's nicer than my place.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> It's important that I learn this.
<s> Like me?
<s> Come one Will. I just want to know.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
<s> No, you don't want to hear that.
<s> I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
<s> Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
<s> Got a warrant?
<s> I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
<s> Say, who runs this place?
<s> Why ain't they more like it?
<s> I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
<s> Just around that next bend.
<s> That's our place.
<s> They never wrote you nothing?
<s> We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
<s> Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
<s> But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
<s> Women is always tar'd.
<s> Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
<s> What you mean?
<s> Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
<s> Hush!
<s> Take her with you!
<s> 'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
<s> You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
<s> Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
<s> Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
<s> Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
<s> Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
<s> She'll be awright.
<s> I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
<s> Sometimes they do.
<s> That's right. And douse some in it.
<s> Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
<s> They killed Casy first.
<s> They know what--this fella looks like?
<s> Don't know--but it's better'n this.
<s> Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
<s> It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
<s> Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
<s> Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
<s> I know that! But *where* they gone?
<s> Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
<s> Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
<s> I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
<s> We gonna stay, ain't we?
<s> I wisht it was day.
<s> Won't they ketch us?
<s> I seen 'em b'fore you did.
<s> Now don't you go monk'ing--
<s> We can pick anything.
<s> Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
<s> I sell biscuits to the Southland.
<s> Wonderful.
<s> Really?
<s> Then express yourself, Bob.
<s> A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
<s> You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
<s> This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
<s> Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
<s> Jesus Christ!
<s> I'm staying here.
<s> I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
<s> They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
<s> What stuff?
<s> Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
<s> No harm no foul.
<s> Those all seem kind of related...
<s> In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
<s> Yup.
<s> It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
<s> Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
<s> It's fine.
<s> See you in ten years.
<s> That's good.
<s> Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
<s> Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
<s> When I was first married.
<s> Well, I, uh... you didn't...
<s> Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
<s> You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
<s> Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
<s> Feel good?
<s> Five years. My son was born here.
<s> Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
<s> College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
<s> It is. It's lovely.
<s> We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
<s> Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
<s> Huh?
<s> Tom.
<s> Annie!
<s> Is that your version of a pep talk?
<s> What about him?
<s> I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
<s> I didn't know I had to.
<s> What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
<s> You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
<s> Then why do you want to leave?
<s> Little.
<s> Hi.
<s> You already did.
<s> Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
<s> NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
<s> LEAVE ME ALONE!!
<s> That's not true.
<s> Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
<s> Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
<s> Yeah. Bye.
<s> No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
<s> Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
<s> Doing what?
<s> Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
<s> No. I was just researching. Calm down.
<s> Okay.
<s> Everything all right.
<s> Take your time.
<s> We have a business manager. The best around.
<s> Either fight the way things are or accept it.
<s> Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
<s> I'd love to go there one time...
<s> Well, I am going to go after lunch.
<s> You too, Diane.
<s> Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
<s> Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
<s> Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
<s> Diane!
<s> Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
<s> I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
<s> I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
<s> You're catching on.
<s> There's no hurry. Take you time.
<s> I want to watch.
<s> No!
<s> NO!
<s> YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
<s> I understand...
<s> Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
<s> How long were you married?
<s> About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
<s> It's cool!
<s> I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
<s> Alright sir.
<s> Hack the Planet!
<s> ...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
<s> The sensitive type.
<s> Again?  Yeah sure.
<s> Super hero like even.
<s> That's far out!
<s> ...as they snoop onto us.
<s> No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
<s> I'm taking over a TV network.
<s> Mm-hmm.
<s> Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
<s> And unpack.
<s> Blow me.
<s> Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
<s> How did you know that?
<s> And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
<s> My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
<s> Think you can do better?
<s> Yeah?
<s> You're not gonna win.
<s> This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
<s> Cancer?
<s> The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
<s> As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
<s> Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
<s> I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
<s> Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
<s> I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> My parents are going to come home early tonight.
<s> I don't know Brady.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Brady! Come with us.
<s> You guys always look great.
<s> I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
<s> Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
<s> I'm not calling the fire department.
<s> How many bodies did you find?
<s> Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
<s> Drive Carefully.
<s> Got it Earl.
<s> Do you love me Rachel?
<s> Like a sister?
<s> Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
<s> But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
<s> Coming.
<s> No.
<s> Dad, what's going on?
<s> You knew. You just didn't care.
<s> Don't you mean what you do best?
<s> No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
<s> Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
<s> Okay, bye.
<s> The state police won't know how to stop him.
<s> Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
<s> Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
<s> Yes.
<s> It isn't a man.
<s> You blame everything on kids.
<s> He shouts, too.
<s> Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
<s> I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
<s> He can still watch.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
<s> I can't.
<s> Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
<s> Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
<s> I thought you were gonna get one for me.
<s> Will you call me tomorrow?
<s> Promise?
<s> He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
<s> Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
<s> Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
<s> More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
<s> The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
<s> Totally.
<s> Same time, same place.
<s> I don't like that story.
<s> Why are they under there?
<s> After the Jack-O-Lantern.
<s> We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
<s> I saw him...
<s> There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
<s> Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
<s> What did you use before?
<s> I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
<s> Only minimum security.
<s> You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
<s> Well, let's hope so.
<s> Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
<s> Oh, it's magnificent!
<s> Oh, is that what it is?
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
<s> Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
<s> It depends on what way you want to go.
<s> Uh...
<s> Right.
<s> Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
<s> Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
<s> Ah! HOLLY  Now.
<s> I cry at the opera.
<s> I'm an architect.
<s> What time do you get off?
<s> It's terrific!
<s> Oh, okay.
<s> Let's take a look.
<s> Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
<s> Yeah?
<s> You're out looking here?
<s> Oh.  Well, I live--
<s> Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
<s> Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
<s> Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
<s> Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
<s> Oh, that's nice.
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
<s> Oh, right.
<s> I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
<s> Was I?
<s> But, you got four children!
<s> Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
<s> Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
<s> It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
<s> I am glad to see you.
<s> But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
<s> Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
<s> Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
<s> I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
<s> Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
<s> No.
<s> I'm saying it now!
<s> Jesus...Jesus!
<s> Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
<s> Hello?
<s> I can't keep my mind on the show.
<s> You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
<s> I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
<s> Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
<s> You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
<s> Really?
<s> He's fine.
<s> Oh!
<s> Football!
<s> Well, then a third opinion.
<s> Well, what about artificial insemination?
<s> He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
<s> No, no, we decided!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, your kids are so adorable.
<s> Here.  Be careful with those.
<s> Oooo.
<s> Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
<s> Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
<s> Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
<s> I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
<s> But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
<s> We didn't hit it off.
<s> How are you?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> No, well...I've been trying to write.
<s> I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
<s> What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
<s> You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
<s> Hmm.
<s> I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
<s> ...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
<s> I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
<s> Just a few minutes ago.
<s> At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
<s> Oh...
<s> Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
<s> I <u>swear</u> to you...
<s> Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
<s> It's a growth business.
<s> He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
<s> He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
<s> Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
<s> And who is "they?"
<s> M'I gonna see you tonight?
<s> Then I'm doing fine.
<s> Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
<s> ...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
<s> Seen what, sir..?
<s> Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
<s> Mmm...
<s> You said the <u>bad</u> news...
<s> I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
<s> Let the girl go.
<s> And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
<s> How's your <u>child</u>?
<s> Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
<s> Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
<s> Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
<s> I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
<s> Why did you look at me that way?
<s> Enchante.
<s> If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
<s> ...who say...?
<s> Sir, with all due respect....
<s> Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
<s> ...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
<s> Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
<s> What is that that smells so wonderful.
<s> It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
<s> Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
<s> Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
<s> ...not to turn around.
<s> I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
<s> Every suicide kills two.
<s> Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
<s> You goin to shoot yourself? 
<s> ...<u>what</u>...?
<s> They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
<s> We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
<s> I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
<s> I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
<s> No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
<s> It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
<s> Brazilian. 
<s> And what does <u>that</u> mean?
<s> No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
<s> How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
<s> ...why?
<s> <u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
<s> That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
<s> You have no idea. Now run away.
<s> Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
<s> Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
<s> What are you gonna do about it?
<s> Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
<s> Goodnight.
<s> That wants to be a Yes.
<s> Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
<s> This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
<s> Yeah. And?
<s> We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
<s> Talia, you're a wonderful person...
<s> About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
<s> And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
<s> I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
<s> I should leave. You probably need your rest.
<s> Something like that. Will you do it?
<s> I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
<s> We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
<s> Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
<s> Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
<s> Heather.
<s> You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
<s> People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
<s> Give it up girl!
<s> Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
<s> Suicide is a private thing.
<s> How very.
<s> Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
<s> Like a suicide thing?
<s> Yeah. Scary stuff.
<s> French.
<s> What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
<s> I thought I...you..
<s> Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
<s> Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
<s> This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
<s> What's that?
<s> sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
<s> Look who I've found!
<s> I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
<s> She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
<s> breaks down into heavy sobs.
<s> Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
<s> glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
<s> leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
<s> But she'll have no one to look after her!
<s> From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
<s> grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
<s> You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
<s> turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
<s> He . . .
<s> Him . . .
<s> That . . .
<s> Hurry up! I'm freezing!
<s> All right, then.
<s> Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
<s> Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
<s> All finished.
<s> Did I ever talk about the accident?
<s> What's the occasion?
<s> I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
<s> Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
<s> There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
<s> Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
<s> Where's my wife?
<s> Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
<s> Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
<s> No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
<s> YOU!
<s> Try stupid.
<s> LaPlante!
<s> Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
<s> I was in the can, for Chrissake.
<s> What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
<s> You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
<s> I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
<s> Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
<s> Mister LaPlante...
<s> Mister LaPlante...
<s> You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
<s> Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
<s> DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
<s> THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
<s> You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
<s> Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
<s> How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
<s> The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
<s> He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
<s> Lie, you mean...
<s> Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
<s> All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
<s> A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
<s> No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
<s> Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
<s> You're sitting on your ticket.
<s> What about a reward for coming forward?
<s> Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
<s> What's "cynical"?
<s> An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
<s> I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
<s> He's pretty... remarkable.
<s> Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
<s> Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
<s> Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
<s> That would be stupid.
<s> Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
<s> I think we should talk first.
<s> I've asked him what's wrong.
<s> No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
<s> The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
<s> He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
<s> Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
<s> Where should I hide the car keys?
<s> Philip!  The senior partner?
<s> Oh baby.
<s> There might be some extras in the garage.
<s> No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
<s> We'll talk in the morning.
<s> Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
<s> No.
<s> I have a cold.
<s> Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
<s> Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
<s> Would you?
<s> Really.
<s> Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
<s> Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
<s> Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
<s> Lieutenant.
<s> Central Park.
<s> Is that it?
<s> Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
<s> Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
<s> It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
<s> Then it's worth the journey.
<s> For what?
<s> We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
<s> If it came down to it what would you do?
<s> She's the King's cousin.
<s> That doesn't matter.
<s> Where I'm going you cannot follow.
<s> This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
<s> I'll be fine.
<s> Because it's my name.
<s> I don't know anymore.
<s> You remind me of someone I used to know.
<s> New York is dangerous place.
<s> About what?
<s> I'm interested in mythology.
<s> A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
<s> --the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
<s> If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
<s> Conner?
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> It's not for me to decide.
<s> You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
<s> I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
<s> No.  The money, please.
<s> It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
<s> I'll make the call.
<s> Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
<s> Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
<s> Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
<s> We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
<s> That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
<s> We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
<s> For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
<s> The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
<s> The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
<s> I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
<s> Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
<s> You can't run with suitcases.
<s> Dennis.
<s> You fucked up, Glen.
<s> You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
<s> I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
<s> If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
<s> We'll see you in a couple of hours.
<s> Be quiet!  Listen!
<s> Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
<s> Stop it.
<s> What are we going to do about Mike?
<s> I know the one.
<s> Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
<s> Goddamned small town bullshit.
<s> Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
<s> Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
<s> Special Agent Jones.
<s> They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
<s> Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
<s> Can you get into the office?
<s> Who is it?
<s> They're still in the house.
<s> Yes.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
<s> Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
<s> Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
<s> That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
<s> I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
<s> As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
<s> What did you overhear?
<s> Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
<s> I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
<s> Whiskey?
<s> How so.
<s> Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh my God!
<s> Fuck you.
<s> When will they be here?
<s> Gregoire, what are you doing here?
<s> For supplies, you drive.
<s> Just drive, Gregoire.
<s> The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
<s> I need a great favor.
<s> I will give you my house.
<s> The third floor are low class rooms.
<s> What?
<s> Please, be quiet.
<s> Jean Baptiste!
<s> Murdered! By whom?
<s> I sent them home. Go and call them.
<s> Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
<s> Dawn. Then they go.
<s> Please go back, bring the children to us.
<s> But who is left?
<s> Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
<s> Why?
<s> It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
<s> Many times.
<s> He has taken the presidential suite.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
<s> Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
<s> I'm confused.
<s> -- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
<s> -- the whole thing is falling apart!
<s> But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
<s> Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
<s> Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
<s> I'm moved beyond words.
<s> Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
<s> It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
<s> A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
<s> Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
<s> -- what was he doing here?
<s> -- fuck you!
<s> You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
<s> Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
<s> Did it work?
<s> And we get this money when?
<s> -- yeah, we did that --
<s> Let's try down here...
<s> -- was that??
<s> For chrissake give me a hand!
<s> I don't do groups.
<s> You've got your own TV show?
<s> I hope not.
<s> Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
<s> Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
<s> A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
<s> Asking the wrong person again.
<s> -- I pose you the same question --
<s> -- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
<s> Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
<s> Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
<s> You didn't think to ask?
<s> No, no, it's just --
<s> Maybe if I --
<s> Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
<s> I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
<s> Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
<s> Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
<s> Well, I can't, sweetheart.
<s> "Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
<s> Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
<s> The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
<s> Blackburn's dead.
<s> -- ten.
<s> Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
<s> What will they tell you?
<s> So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
<s> Good-bye.
<s> By killing them?
<s> We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
<s> She talks to me.
<s> I'm scared!
<s> We're going to go someplace new.
<s> Where is she?
<s> Daddy help!
<s> Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
<s> Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
<s> Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
<s> I don't know.  That's strange.
<s> She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
<s> Ok.
<s> Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
<s> She has a...friend.  Colleen.
<s> No...  NO!
<s> Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
<s> We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
<s> Before.
<s> Yeah, they told us this was the best.
<s> White meat will be fine...
<s> So what should we do, father?
<s> Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
<s> And you...are?
<s> Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
<s> What are you getting at!
<s> It will not take long...
<s> Runic?
<s> Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
<s> Right.
<s> What is it?
<s> I'm trying to quit.
<s> Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
<s> Who's that?
<s> God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
<s> No.  We want ...
<s> Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
<s> What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
<s> What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
<s> Not quite.
<s> Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
<s> Really?
<s> Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
<s> I laughed, I cried.
<s> Guards come exactly every three minutes....
<s> Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
<s> Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
<s> Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
<s> Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
<s> Rutherford Auction... that name...
<s> Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
<s> "And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
<s> Don't worry, we'll get it...
<s> Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
<s> Yeah.  The big E.
<s> Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
<s> Never, why do you ask?
<s> I'll bring my entire repertoire...
<s> Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
<s> Oh, I'm so sorry...
<s> Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
<s> I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
<s> Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
<s> When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
<s> Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
<s> Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
<s> Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
<s> The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
<s> Alchemy.
<s> When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
<s> Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
<s> They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
<s> The Hudsucker Hoop!
<s> We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
<s> I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
<s> Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
<s> Why yes, do you know it?
<s> ...Why don't I just type this up...
<s> Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
<s> Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
<s> Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
<s> You don't say.
<s> That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
<s> Phony, huh?
<s> Sez who?
<s> Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
<s> Watch it, Archer --
<s> Terrific.
<s> What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
<s> This I know, Benny.
<s> Well, I --
<s> Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
<s> Yeah?
<s> I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
<s> That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
<s> You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
<s> Wait a minute!
<s> Well, I'm a college graduate --
<s> Well, I made the dean's list.
<s> Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Sir, my leg is on fire!
<s> Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
<s> Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
<s> Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
<s> There's one in every story.
<s> She looks in her purse...
<s> He don't look wise.
<s> That's nonsense, Alma.
<s> Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
<s> So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
<s> I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
<s> I've never heard of a cure.
<s> It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
<s> I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
<s> Yes -- on the boat.
<s> Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
<s> It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
<s> I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
<s> Of course, Wes.
<s> I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
<s> Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
<s> Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
<s> Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
<s> No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
<s> I am not a frightened girl.
<s> Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
<s> Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
<s> Well, I had a good time up to a point.
<s> Why did you come in here?
<s> She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
<s> What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
<s> How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
<s> The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
<s> I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
<s> I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
<s> Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
<s> You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
<s> Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
<s> Got a meeting uptown.
<s> So maybe you'll come too?
<s> Good night.
<s> I do. I'm -- are you...?
<s> I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
<s> No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
<s> That shirt?
<s> That one.
<s> Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
<s> What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
<s> Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
<s> I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
<s> Ben.
<s> The phone's out.
<s> Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
<s> Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
<s> Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
<s> You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
<s> If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
<s> C'mon.
<s> Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
<s> Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
<s> What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
<s> With Mikey?
<s> It'll warm you up.
<s> It's not like we're too busy.
<s> Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
<s> All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
<s> I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
<s> Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
<s> I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
<s> And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
<s> Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
<s> Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
<s> Hey, it's a sellable skill.
<s> It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
<s> Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
<s> Tell Sandy? What?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Greetings, Charles.
<s> What time is it?
<s> I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
<s> That's all, for now.
<s> What's that, then?
<s> Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
<s> What's the D.A. got them on?
<s> About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
<s> Twelve years younger.
<s> Okay.
<s> I know.
<s> Why?
<s> I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
<s> And something else that might interest you.
<s> That's right.
<s> She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
<s> I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
<s> Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
<s> What are we thinking?
<s> We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
<s> After that she left the party to go to him.
<s> You're not missing much.
<s> Must be tough for you.  What happened.
<s> You're going to be brought in for questioning.
<s> Did you have sex with her?
<s> Told you I could write an ending.
<s> There's nothing more to talk about.
<s> Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
<s> I didn't want to kill her, Will.
<s> This an accident, Walter?
<s> Yes, and very beautiful.
<s> Surely you know the one who made you...
<s> You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
<s> He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
<s> Yes... My God...
<s> It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
<s> What you are? You would be something other than you are?
<s> It will grow back again!
<s> And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
<s> And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
<s> And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
<s> Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
<s> Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
<s> How devilishly clever.
<s> And no one knows but us...
<s> What danger?
<s> Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
<s> But if she dies...
<s> Yes...
<s> And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
<s> Why should I be?
<s> How do you mean, start?
<s> I can't do it.
<s> I can't go through with it, I tell you.
<s> But why do you want me?
<s> Yes...
<s> The crucifix -
<s> Do you think so?
<s> Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
<s> I don't pretend to know.
<s> NO!!!
<s> Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
<s> Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
<s> You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
<s> Perhaps lucky for both of us.
<s> Can a vampire feel love?
<s> How could I not? She had to know.
<s> He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
<s> Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
<s> Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
<s> Is that bad?
<s> July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
<s> It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
<s> Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
<s> What are you doing in my closet?
<s> Yet. Nothing yet.
<s> Where is everyone? I'll ask --
<s> Yes.
<s> We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
<s> Then, we fight --
<s> Come on, you can make it.
<s> It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
<s> Will you try...for me, please?
<s> Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
<s> Fine. Show me the body.
<s> It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
<s> It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
<s> It's...him.
<s> Rio, baby!
<s> I don't know, but I'm starving.
<s> How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
<s> We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
<s> How much?
<s> How much?
<s> Must have missed the sign.
<s> See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
<s> They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
<s> In case you do so, would you --
<s> Good winds and bad winds!
<s> I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
<s> Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
<s> Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
<s> I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
<s> That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
<s> No.  She shall not be left here.
<s> That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
<s> How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
<s> Sleep well.
<s> I think not.
<s> No one can take my father's place.
<s> Poor Cathy --
<s> No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
<s> In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
<s> You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
<s> Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
<s> If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
<s> Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
<s> Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
<s> She's not too well.
<s> You are my friend.
<s> Listen to what I say --
<s> Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
<s> It is for that he hates me.
<s> Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
<s> Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
<s> I hate to do this, fella.
<s> Merry Christmas.
<s> Suicide.
<s> Well, who are you, then?
<s> Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
<s> I said I wish I'd never been born.
<s> You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
<s> Our clothes are dry.
<s> Why? Don't they believe in angels?
<s> Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
<s> Well, naturally. Of course.
<s> Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
<s> That's the kid.
<s> Yes, but George . . .
<s> No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
<s> Thanks.
<s> It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
<s> Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
<s> Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
<s> Give the flower a drink.
<s> Will you try to get some sleep?
<s> Goodbye, Sam.
<s> No charge.
<s> Oh, stop that grunting.
<s> Well, she's not crazy about him.
<s> And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Don't hurt my ear again!
<s> No. No.
<s> Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
<s> I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
<s> Maybe you were born older, George.
<s> Still after that first million before you're thirty.
<s> Harry . . . Harry . . .
<s> What's that?
<s> George . . .
<s> I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
<s> Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
<s> You like it? I'll send you a box.
<s> Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
<s> That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
<s> Neither am I.
<s> Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
<s> Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
<s> What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
<s> About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
<s> Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
<s> Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
<s> George, darling! Where have you been?
<s> Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
<s> What?
<s> Sure, sure I am.
<s> Well, I don't know....
<s> Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
<s> Swim for it!
<s> Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
<s> Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
<s> There's a shark....
<s> Let's just go sailing, okay?
<s> The rope!  The rope!
<s> N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
<s> It's still there!
<s> Happy to do it.
<s> Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
<s> Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
<s> Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
<s> It's good with coffee.
<s> What're you guys doing today?
<s> Careful.  What's wrong?
<s> Nothing, huh?
<s> Do you?
<s> ...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
<s> Going out.
<s> Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
<s> Two of them are still missing!
<s> Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
<s> Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
<s> You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
<s> I will, I will.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Help!  Help!
<s> That's a crock of shit.
<s> Huh?
<s> Nope.
<s> The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
<s> And second?
<s> That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
<s> What Kids?  Who went out?
<s> I'm going.
<s> Power line.
<s> I love it.
<s> Might as well.
<s> When are we going out?  You and me?
<s> Okay, okay.  Close your door.
<s> Len, can I see you a minute?
<s> Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
<s> I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
<s> It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
<s> You buying?
<s> I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
<s> Yes.
<s> Hi, baby.
<s> ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
<s> Up.
<s> Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
<s> Sounds wonderful.
<s> I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
<s> Hydrophobia...
<s> I have to get out of here.
<s> I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
<s> I don't understand.
<s> It's all controlled from the Control Room.
<s> I want that shark, Kathryn.
<s> I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
<s> No, no.  That won't do.
<s> I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
<s> Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
<s> Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
<s> Still sleeping.
<s> The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
<s> She, Mister Hutton.
<s> And big for his age.
<s> Don't blame yourself.
<s> He's missing.
<s> Massachussettans aren't.
<s> Depends on big brother.
<s> That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
<s> Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
<s> No, think of something else.
<s> Can hardly wait to do it again.
<s> Now what's this do?
<s> What?
<s> It's disappeared.
<s> Yeah, poor bastard.
<s> All right, hit those lights too.
<s> Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
<s> Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
<s> Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
<s> Don't hurry back.
<s> It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
<s> It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
<s> Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
<s> Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Nowhere....
<s> Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
<s> My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
<s> We need beer....
<s> I don't know...You...I don't know.
<s> They're at the beach....
<s> She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
<s> I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
<s> I'm not on vacation....
<s> I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
<s> What difference does it make?  It's here....
<s> Stop what?
<s> I'm hungry, Mom....
<s> I won't....
<s> I didn't.
<s> I'll miss you....
<s> Mother....
<s> You guys must be starving....
<s> I'm just getting started....
<s> Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
<s> It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
<s> Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
<s> I'm not going to quit now....
<s> Trying to write our report....
<s> I'm fine....
<s> I have to get this finished.
<s> First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
<s> Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
<s> I always listen to my feelings....
<s> Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
<s> No one does till they learn....
<s> If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
<s> Where do I pull off...?
<s> Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
<s> Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
<s> That's hard to imagine....
<s> You're always taking time off....
<s> There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
<s> We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
<s> You sure you know how to do this.
<s> Get her started....
<s> All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
<s> Tell Thea I'm sorry....
<s> Still chasing fish?
<s> If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
<s> I made them, man....
<s> I didn't do it on purpose....
<s> May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
<s> Forget it....
<s> It's not a bad life, Jake....
<s> Don't say anything about this to my mother....
<s> Down here....
<s> Gave them the day off....
<s> As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
<s> We don't write up anything until we're done....
<s> So far..
<s> As long as he's been here....
<s> How long has he been here...?
<s> You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
<s> I am...You must know something about him....
<s> Maybe the gear crapped out....
<s> Just trying to be helpful....
<s> Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
<s> It'll work....
<s> My equipment doesn't crap out....
<s> No way....
<s> Here it comes....
<s> Good night, Polly....
<s> Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
<s> Yeah?
<s> Only me and Mom ..
<s> You heard. Look for the knife.
<s> "Welcome to Eureka."
<s> Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
<s> I think you're here all day.
<s> The <u>dogs</u>?
<s> I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
<s> Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
<s> I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
<s> For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
<s> He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
<s> Just makes to so God damned mad ..
<s> Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
<s> Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
<s> Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
<s> Bits.
<s> We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
<s> You ain't going in alone?
<s> Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
<s> We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
<s> Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
<s> I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
<s> What are you looking for?
<s> <u>You</u> put it in there.
<s> <u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
<s> I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
<s> When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
<s> I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
<s> I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
<s> It was probably the wind.
<s> Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
<s> You said, you were in the bad lands?
<s> Really? What did he say?
<s> Which is what?
<s> I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
<s> Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
<s> I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<s> I know about alcohol, John.
<s> You find something curious in that?
<s> Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
<s> You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
<s> Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
<s> I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
<s> She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
<s> I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
<s> Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
<s> I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
<s> Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
<s> I know about the bachelor party.
<s> Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
<s> -- stop --
<s> Oh come on --
<s> No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
<s> My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> I just got goosebumps.
<s> Well, I'm happy for you.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
<s> And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
<s> Do you have something to drink?
<s> Good evening.
<s> Happy. He said "happy?"
<s> Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
<s> Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
<s> Why do you love me?
<s> Tell me -- let me help --
<s> So this break... is a break-up.
<s> Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
<s> Please, if I start talking --
<s> Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
<s> Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
<s> Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
<s> I gotta get back to Cushman.
<s> Huh?
<s> Rod, get on the camel.
<s> How do I know?
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> No, you're --
<s> Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
<s> No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
<s> Damn right.
<s> Go.  Flee.
<s> Well.  Good luck with that --
<s> Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
<s> The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
<s> I came here to let you go. _ 27.
<s> Dick.
<s> I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
<s> Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
<s> We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
<s> That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
<s> And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
<s> Quiet!
<s> One way to find out.
<s> From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
<s> Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
<s> People change.
<s> Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
<s> Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
<s> Just drop it Paul!
<s> He's this way.
<s> We're not going anywhere, I promise.
<s> How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
<s> You mean it?
<s> I would completely support that.
<s> What about Eric?
<s> He loves you too.
<s> Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
<s> We'll be broke in four weeks.
<s> I don't remember that on InGen's list.
<s> Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
<s> Really?  What do you do there?
<s> Raptors, mostly.
<s> You think they could talk to each other?
<s> In Costa Rica?
<s> I want to be an astronaut.
<s> But then you never get to go in space.
<s> You should.
<s> No. I couldn't see.
<s> No we're not.
<s> But you never came across just one.
<s> Just a little bit too much, I think.
<s> No.  I feel something.
<s> Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
<s> Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
<s> Everyone, keep your voices down!
<s> I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
<s> You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
<s> It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
<s> Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
<s> Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
<s> It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
<s> Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
<s> What?!
<s> What?
<s> Birdshit?
<s> Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
<s> Oh, no!
<s> I'm trying!
<s> How would we cut off the lysine?
<s> Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
<s> That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
<s> The Cretaceous.
<s> Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
<s> Not just every six weeks.
<s> - - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
<s> You can't hold it by yourself!
<s> No, no, no!
<s> Stick to my heels.
<s> Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
<s> And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
<s> No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
<s> Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
<s> In a box under my seat.
<s> Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
<s> No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
<s> Oh, yeah - - great.
<s> Listen, ahh - -
<s> Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
<s> That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
<s> That's a good idea.
<s> You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
<s> I know.
<s> Who?
<s> Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
<s> I'll stay awake.
<s> It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
<s> You're a beautiful big animal.
<s> Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
<s> Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
<s> Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
<s> Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
<s> You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
<s> I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
<s> Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
<s> They don't bother me.
<s> I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
<s> We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
<s> He... he's here...
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Come on.
<s> He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
<s> Who's chest?
<s> A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
<s> Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
<s> So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
<s> You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
<s> Insomnolesence...
<s> He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
<s> Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
<s> Yeah, what is it?
<s> That doesn't make sense.
<s> Great.	When can you do it?
<s> I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
<s> Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
<s> Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
<s> Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
<s> And if he's not?
<s> _Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
<s> If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
<s> My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
<s> What was the matter with it?
<s> I don't know what you could have read.
<s> Yes.
<s> What an extraordinary request!
<s> I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
<s> Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
<s> Yes.
<s> Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
<s> ... My ... social situation?
<s> You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
<s> It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
<s> Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
<s> I do.
<s> No.
<s> Tonight?
<s> And you ...?
<s> At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
<s> It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
<s> He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
<s> I've heard of it happening.
<s> Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
<s> I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
<s> No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
<s> -- Accident and Compensation Association.
<s> Well -- other departments are, yes.
<s> What makes you think so?
<s> That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
<s> You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
<s> You mean you've actually begun some?
<s> Then why haven't I been --
<s> ... A piece of paper ...
<s> Yes.  Isn't it there?
<s> We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
<s> It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
<s> It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
<s> Father ... Father!
<s> Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
<s> You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
<s> Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
<s> Jack!...  Jack!
<s> Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
<s> Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
<s> An ape ... some kind of ape.
<s> How about Ann? Is she going with you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
<s> Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
<s> You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
<s> Sorry. 
<s> Didn't want you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Will you let me go then?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
<s> He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
<s> Mm.
<s> Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
<s> Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
<s> Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
<s> -- OK --
<s> I don't see anything, do you?
<s> Arlyn Page.
<s> Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't get you.
<s> Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
<s> They don't scare me any more.
<s> Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
<s> Can you use these?
<s> How is it back there?
<s> Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
<s> Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
<s> Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
<s> Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
<s> It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
<s> What's in it?
<s> Goodbye, Pete.
<s> Did she talk about him to you?
<s> Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
<s> I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
<s> I looked it up.
<s> We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
<s> Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
<s> Not particularly.
<s> What about your mommy?
<s> Do you like to be with your mommy?
<s> The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
<s> Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
<s> I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
<s> I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
<s> Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
<s> I guess...
<s> C'mon, there's not much difference--
<s> I'm allergic to onions.
<s> Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Oh...
<s> Good night.
<s> Dad?
<s> See you in the morning light...
<s> No, she never did.
<s> Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
<s> Like a principal?
<s> Does the witness deny the injury took place?
<s> Then I have concluded my questions.
<s> Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
<s> Objection!
<s> Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
<s> It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
<s> Thank you.  I have no further questions.
<s> More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
<s> What about Billy?
<s> You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
<s> You've been living here, in the city?
<s> Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
<s> Oh, God...Oh, my God...
<s> I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--
<s> Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
<s> Kramer--
<s> But it's not a year from now, is it?
<s> First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
<s> I can't tell you how sorry I am.
<s> Ted?  Are you there?
<s> What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
<s> Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
<s> Any day.
<s> Ha!  You tell me.
<s> It is alright, Father.
<s> But, I am in charge.
<s> And you have horses? You love horses.
<s> You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
<s> Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
<s> All?
<s> Then, we shall meet.
<s> Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
<s> At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
<s> How many?
<s> Please.
<s> It is an island. American territory.
<s> He warned about the future of Tibet.
<s> So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
<s> Britain?
<s> The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
<s> Where is that?
<s> Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
<s> The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
<s> Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
<s> The people will not allow it.
<s> Thank you.
<s> For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
<s> You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
<s> Is that a true story, or pretend?
<s> Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
<s> Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
<s> I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
<s> We cannot.
<s> I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
<s> Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Thank you.
<s> They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
<s> And you like me.
<s> They don't really attack underwater and--
<s> It came from across the lake.
<s> Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
<s> Bastard bit my chopper.
<s> I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
<s> Right.
<s> Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
<s> I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
<s> Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
<s> Guess I finally got bit.
<s> Yeah.  Thanks to you.
<s> Never been to Maine before?
<s> So I don't like tents, why--
<s> Good.  See ya soon.
<s> A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Ssssh!
<s> I heard something.
<s> Maybe.  Don't mush it.
<s> He heeds a tourniquet.
<s> Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
<s> So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
<s> Good thinking.
<s> Let's go.
<s> You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
<s> Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
<s> I'll take it!
<s> Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
<s> Well.  At wakes.
<s> Yes.
<s> What kind of backup do we have?
<s> I got nothing against--
<s> Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
<s> Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
<s> And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
<s> <u>That</u> was a bust.
<s> Yes.
<s> Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
<s> She's worried about the cow now.
<s> Wait.
<s> I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
<s> Else.
<s> I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
<s> Part of our research--
<s> <u>Kelly</u>--
<s> Wild guess.
<s> Backstabber?
<s> Thanks, Ardelia.
<s> Where?
<s> I will... I promise.
<s> I understand.
<s> Starling -
<s> Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
<s> Jack Gordon.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
<s> You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
<s> They weren't there. Get close-ups.
<s> Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
<s> Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
<s> Let's get some coffee and talk.
<s> Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
<s> You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
<s> But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
<s> Sewing...
<s> They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
<s> I think so.
<s> Sometimes you do.
<s> Yes.
<s> How many women has he used, our Bill?
<s> All flayed...?
<s> And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
<s> I never thought about it.
<s> That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
<s> Who killed your patient?
<s> Big through the hips. Roomy.
<s> I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
<s> A cattle ranch?
<s> There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
<s> The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
<s> I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
<s> Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
<s> And - one morning I just - ran away...
<s> What was it?
<s> Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
<s> Yes...! They were screaming.
<s> Yes...
<s> Dr. Lecter -
<s> That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
<s> It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
<s> Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
<s> Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
<s> Because what I am interested in is right here...
<s> Yes. I want you to go.
<s> Alice?
<s> I have nothing to go back for.
<s> Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
<s> Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
<s> "Some"?
<s> He delivered no such message.
<s> What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
<s> : Only one or two loads.
<s> ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
<s> We'll see in the morning...
<s> Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
<s> You're not coming with us?
<s> ...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
<s> Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
<s> By your leave, sir.
<s> You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
<s> Sir!
<s> Fire!
<s> Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
<s> Wampum?
<s> Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
<s> When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
<s> But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
<s> Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
<s> La victoire.
<s> It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
<s> You screw around like that again and--
<s> Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
<s> Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
<s> Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
<s> Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
<s> What's your air reading?
<s> Okay.
<s> Do it.
<s> I realize you must have gone through hell--
<s> Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
<s> Itches like hell.
<s> Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
<s> He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
<s> It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
<s> I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
<s> Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
<s> The infirmary?...
<s> It's had a meal.
<s> Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
<s> Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
<s> He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
<s> Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
<s> It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
<s> I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
<s> You get the guns?
<s> Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
<s> Can I help?
<s> No Harry, you can't.
<s> Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
<s> It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
<s> All right, Kenny.
<s> We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
<s> This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
<s> Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> Out the back.
<s> Invitations?
<s> Hit the fuckers.
<s> Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
<s> Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
<s> You will what?
<s> It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
<s> Of course you are. All right, Ed.
<s> Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
<s> I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
<s> I'll only be a minute.
<s> So?
<s> Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
<s> Nick the Greek.
<s> That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
<s> They're not going to jail.
<s> No, sir--
<s> I-I can do the job, sir.
<s> I am, sir.
<s> It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
<s> I mean, follow orders, sir.
<s> Thank you, Sergeant Major.
<s> If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
<s> Sergeant?
<s> I'm feeling okay--
<s> You're testing me?
<s> Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
<s> Colt Peacemaker.
<s> So is Buddy on your short list?
<s> There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
<s> You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
<s> You little pissant--
<s> Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
<s> --they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
<s> No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
<s> If it's too late--
<s> Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
<s> Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
<s> So they stayed in Florida?
<s> But they were Indians themselves.
<s> That guy who got shot--
<s> You wouldn't?
<s> Cool.
<s> You own this place?
<s> It's a lead mine.
<s> Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
<s> We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
<s> You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
<s> If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
<s> She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
<s> We should just do it.
<s> You could take it--
<s> I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
<s> If the next guy's a redneck.
<s> Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
<s> That's where he fell.
<s> We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
<s> I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
<s> Why would you want to do that?
<s> No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
<s> I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
<s> Protection?
<s> Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
<s> Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
<s> Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
<s> I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
<s> We have a daughter.
<s> Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
<s> Seems like we have another one every week.
<s> We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
<s> --Santiago.
<s> Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
<s> Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
<s> All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
<s> You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
<s> Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
<s> Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
<s> Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
<s> All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
<s> I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
<s> Not if I can help it.
<s> What do you think?
<s> I'm surprised he bothered with it.
<s> They've got my Amado.
<s> I can't name anybody she does like these days.
<s> They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I came back 'cause you were here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What was your father's name?
<s> If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
<s> That the problem, son?  You Slow?
<s> You sell much out here?
<s> Hell of a spot to put a business.
<s> Who?
<s> You heard right.
<s> I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
<s> I know him.  I saw him.
<s> He's a priest?
<s> You'll do more.than that.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm no bodyguard.
<s> I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
<s> Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
<s> I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
<s> Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
<s> I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
<s> I told you --
<s> I wasn't.
<s> Quaid and Jennifer--
<s> Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
<s> Hang on!
<s> You can't.
<s> Yes.
<s> Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
<s> So could you walk on water?
<s> Maybe I just bought it.
<s> You know of him?
<s> A ticket home,
<s> Yes.  It's regrettable
<s> I won't say anything.
<s> What's her problem?
<s> Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
<s> Yes...
<s> I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
<s> It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
<s> You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
<s> Will that do?  No?
<s> Didn't know you read minds.
<s> No.
<s> In my time, and nobody else's.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
<s> Who's not?
<s> And he's dead?
<s> You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
<s> Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
<s> Bob, it's me.
<s> I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
<s> Philosophy.
<s> Hi, Charlie.
<s> OK, see you downstairs.
<s> How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
<s> I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
<s> I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
<s> You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
<s> That's ok.
<s> Yeah, look at that thing.
<s> I don't want to be.
<s> A coke.
<s> Hi, Bob.
<s> Yes, no.
<s> Oh?
<s> Yes?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
<s> Good-night.
<s> Is there anything I can do?
<s> Do you want to- 
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Do you want I send it to your room?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Hello, can I have room 5601.
<s> Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
<s> It'll just be a few days.
<s> Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
<s> Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
<s> No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
<s> What happened?
<s> Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
<s> Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
<s> You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
<s> Yes.  It's exactly...
<s> And how would you describe him?
<s> And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
<s> Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
<s> I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
<s> Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
<s> Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
<s> You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
<s> Just open the door, please.
<s> Yes.  We won, that's right.
<s> I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
<s> Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
<s> I think you gave me the wrong one.
<s> I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
<s> That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
<s> The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
<s> I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
<s> When's your birthday?
<s> What's the bible for?
<s> I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
<s> Not a lot.
<s> Thanks for having me, Sally.
<s> Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
<s> As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
<s> He's looking right at me.
<s> Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
<s> You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
<s> Where is she now?
<s> Nothing.
<s> I can't eat before a game.
<s> Nothing.  So good luck.
<s> What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
<s> I don't remember that.
<s> The blue.
<s> Thanks, sweetheart.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> But you use potato?
<s> Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
<s> You're a caterer?
<s> You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
<s> Thanks.
<s> It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
<s> Huh?
<s> It's okay.
<s> Get used to it, babe.
<s> Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Too many times.
<s> I'll take that as a compliment.
<s> Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
<s> Didn't have to try very hard.
<s> How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> Just not my type, I guess.
<s> I just can.
<s> What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
<s> Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
<s> Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
<s> Who said I'm not getting recruited?
<s> I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
<s> I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
<s> None of your business.
<s> That what you think?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
<s> I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
<s> My court, I go first.
<s> Plan to.
<s> It happens, right...
<s> Nobody.
<s> Not really.
<s> Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
<s> The "man" again.
<s> So you fucked around to prove a point!
<s> I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
<s> A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
<s> Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
<s> Getting there.
<s> Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
<s> We need to talk.
<s> What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
<s> Better late than never, right?
<s> Well, can you give him this for me?
<s> Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
<s> At one in the morning?
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> This is just about money, you know that.
<s> I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
<s> Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
<s> Okay...
<s> Your door was unlocked.
<s> Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
<s> No.
<s> I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
<s> I don't know.
<s> These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
<s> It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
<s> Does this sound weird?
<s> Brain and Lung.
<s> Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
<s> I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
<s> YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
<s> LAPD. Open the door.
<s> I'm coming!
<s> And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
<s> Who was it?
<s> It's not -- what's a 422?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
<s> No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
<s> No, no.
<s> No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
<s> You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
<s> Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
<s> I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
<s> You mind if I come in, check things?
<s> I want a shot of tequila too.
<s> I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
<s> How much time do we have?
<s> NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
<s> We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
<s> Put the gun down, please, boy.
<s> It's ok, boy.
<s> That's confidential information, little man.
<s> Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
<s> Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
<s> -- and I'm through playin' games.
<s> Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
<s> This sounds threatening.
<s> Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
<s> You're a friend of the family I presume?
<s> Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
<s> Stay that way.
<s> Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
<s> Yes.
<s> Don't do this, Don.
<s> PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
<s> -- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
<s> No.
<s> She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
<s> When was the last time you talked to your son?
<s> Go fuck myself?
<s> Who are you gonna call?
<s> Who?
<s> It's ok.
<s> Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
<s> -- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
<s> -- let's talk more about your background --
<s> So boring, so useless --
<s> Yes.
<s> What am I doing?
<s> -- fuck you.
<s> Hollywood, mainly.
<s> She's retired.
<s> He passed away.
<s> I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
<s> Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
<s> I'm really sorry.
<s> Mmm.
<s> ...ok...
<s> I don't think, he can't...
<s> I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
<s> No one else in here?
<s> Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
<s> It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
<s> THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
<s> All your other fluzzies?
<s> Yes.
<s> Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
<s> Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
<s> No one else that I know?
<s> How long with Ellen?
<s> How long with Paula?
<s> I don't know what I've done.
<s> You're her boyfriend?
<s> No.  But I probably will get a call back.
<s> I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
<s> Like what?
<s> No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
<s> What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
<s> Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
<s> I gotta go to the bathroom.
<s> You're late, not me.
<s> Go to bed.
<s> It's ok.
<s> ....Why does he do it...?
<s> It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
<s> And you were not hurt?
<s> I wish to discuss your brother.
<s> Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
<s> Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
<s> You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
<s> Making the key to the throne.
<s> Soon enough.  Here we are.
<s> Come, we have a boat waiting.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
<s> He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
<s> It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
<s> Hold your goblet with two fingers.
<s> So what has changed?
<s> They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
<s> There are more important things than tits.
<s> Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
<s> Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
<s> I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
<s> Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
<s> So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
<s> Who?
<s> He is right, d'Artagnan.
<s> Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
<s> I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
<s> If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
<s> Save my son, d'Artagnan.
<s> I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
<s> What is its antidote?
<s> It is something I have done -- or did not do.
<s> How did you --
<s> And you never knew why?
<s> Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
<s> There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
<s> Yes, yes, go on.
<s> Shoot them!  Shoot them!
<s> What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
<s> I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
<s> You set to go -
<s> Alright, stay on the phone.
<s> Did you report it stolen?
<s> He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
<s> I didn't hit shit!
<s> Fine -
<s> Did you start out area six?
<s> It's just...catching up with me, you know?
<s> I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
<s> It wasn't in the cards.
<s> And he took a swing at you?
<s> And what did he do to the girl?
<s> You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
<s> That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
<s> I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
<s> Seattle.
<s> No...
<s> I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
<s> Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
<s> Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
<s> OK...where do you want to start?
<s> I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
<s> I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
<s> Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
<s> You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
<s> His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
<s> That's when it happened?
<s> What's the bottom line?
<s> The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
<s> That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
<s> Twenty minutes max.
<s> Because it's his bad luck to be special.
<s> No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
<s> I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
<s> I am all right.
<s> I know...
<s> You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
<s> What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
<s> Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
<s> I'll pick you up in...
<s> VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
<s> What's that?
<s> The activities of nocturnal animals.
<s> Yes, are you okay...?!
<s> I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
<s> I'm fine, Francis.
<s> Are you okay...?
<s> No!
<s> Was I in an accident?
<s> Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Yes.
<s> Not me.
<s> No.
<s> It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
<s> I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
<s> You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
<s> Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
<s> Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
<s> You haven't smoked in two years.
<s> Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
<s> I have to go back to Birmingham.
<s> It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
<s> You going back down to Florida after?
<s> I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
<s> I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
<s> I keep getting it for Christmas.
<s> It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
<s> You read about it, I'm sure.
<s> Yes.
<s> I want your opinion.
<s> I haven't decided yet.
<s> Do you know how you caught me, Will?
<s> I hope you have a second chance...
<s> Tank you veddy much.
<s> George, I hate sitcoms.
<s> There'll be other shots.
<s> But wasn't it funny?
<s> WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
<s> I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
<s> Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
<s> Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
<s> Andy!
<s> But it's only for thirty seconds!
<s> Twenty!
<s> These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
<s> Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
<s> Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
<s> You don't know the real me.
<s> Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
<s> Then your father's a wimp.
<s> Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
<s> No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
<s> Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
<s> Yes, your Holiness?
<s> FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
<s> Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
<s> "Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
<s> It's already begun.
<s> It's Choi.
<s> Right...
<s> Hear what?
<s> Don't tell me you're a believer now?
<s> You killed them.
<s> Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
<s> How many were there?
<s> What happened to them?
<s> I need an exit!  Fast!
<s> They'll be able to track it.
<s> Yes.  Now.
<s> There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
<s> ... Yes.
<s> It's an honor.
<s> I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
<s> You -- you're too fast.
<s> I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
<s> Because... I didn't think I would?
<s> She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
<s> No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
<s> I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
<s> How do you know that name?
<s> No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
<s> What is the Matrix?
<s> From you.
<s> That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
<s> That's different.
<s> No.
<s> ... right as rain.
<s> A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
<s> Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
<s> I believe I can bring him back.
<s> I'm coming with you.
<s> Do what?
<s> Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
<s> Guns.  Lots of guns.
<s> Kick it in!  Kick it in!
<s> Tank, it's me.
<s> Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
<s> Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
<s> Look fella...this is private...
<s> Let go of her.
<s> Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
<s> She don't look Jewish.
<s> So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
<s> And say what?
<s> Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
<s> Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
<s> Did you see them run!
<s> You tell me that in front of these creeps?
<s> Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
<s> Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
<s> What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
<s> Mind your own business.
<s> No.
<s> Ok, how's everything going?
<s> For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
<s> You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
<s> All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
<s> $3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
<s> 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
<s> Chinese food?
<s> Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
<s> Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
<s> You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
<s> What did he do?
<s> What do they expect you to say?
<s> Anything specific?
<s> CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
<s> A paper on that one too?
<s> Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
<s> Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
<s> Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
<s> For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
<s> The girls like it loud.
<s> This is some boat.  Your father's?
<s> Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
<s> Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
<s> Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
<s> He's coming.
<s> Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
<s> He's cute.
<s> Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
<s> Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
<s> Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
<s> And you could care less --
<s> Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
<s> We've got some things to discuss.
<s> Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
<s> But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
<s> Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
<s> He said he would be there with bells on.
<s> Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
<s> Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
<s> I thought you were buying my company.
<s> What 'business'?
<s> Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
<s> Here...
<s> Cold.
<s> Then why did you bring it up?
<s> Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
<s> I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
<s> Like a marriage made in heaven?
<s> As close as a deal could be.
<s> Uh -- he's from out of town --
<s> But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
<s> How nice for you both.
<s> Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
<s> Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
<s> If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
<s> Are you?
<s> 'It's up to Joe', huh?
<s> -- But he was concerned about the timing?
<s> Sure.
<s> Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
<s> Yes?
<s> Hey, this is fun.
<s> No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
<s> I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
<s> I don't have any.
<s> Then why are you here, Joe?
<s> I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
<s> Yes.
<s> And I appreciate you, too.
<s> We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
<s> Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
<s> Maybe it's the draft through the door.
<s> Oh, I hope a long, long time.
<s> And you can't tell me who you are.
<s> And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
<s> I love you now, I'll love you always --
<s> Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
<s> Thank you.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Make an exception?
<s> Not this.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Are you sad, Bill?
<s> Of course.
<s> No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
<s> I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
<s> Are you going to fire me, Bill?
<s> I'm her father!
<s> Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
<s> Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
<s> I am not a dream.
<s> I believe you did.
<s> I'm sorry, I --
<s> There's going to be plenty of time for that.
<s> Quiet.
<s> What the hell is this?  Who are you?
<s> It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
<s> Time.
<s> Watch it!
<s> I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
<s> How did you know?
<s> Does Drew tell you everything?
<s> ...Then don't.
<s> You're not listening --
<s> Nothing.  I'm sorry.
<s> Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
<s> C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
<s> I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
<s> You and 'Honey'?
<s> I agree --
<s> And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
<s> You never know.  Lightning could strike.
<s> Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
<s> That's the thing. I have this condition.
<s> Interested in buying one?
<s> What the fuck are you doing here?
<s> Deals?
<s> Don't remember.
<s> Yes.
<s> Just relax.
<s> I'll go see him.
<s> This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
<s> I told him about your car.
<s> He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
<s> Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
<s> I have this condition -
<s> What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
<s> That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
<s> Why not?
<s> What?
<s> I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
<s> You're in a playful mood.
<s> Mr Gammell?
<s> No. No, just let me think for a minute.
<s> Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
<s> Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
<s> Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
<s> I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
<s> Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
<s> 'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
<s> You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
<s> It makes all the difference.					 *
<s> Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
<s> You can't just take it!
<s> Doing...?
<s> What's your twenty?
<s> Turn around.
<s> There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
<s> Good.
<s> ...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
<s> Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
<s> And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
<s> Right now.
<s> Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
<s> Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
<s> When?
<s> Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
<s> What'd Neptune tell you?
<s> Backup in case the Russians get physical.
<s> That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
<s> "No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
<s> What kind of weight?
<s> What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
<s> Five minutes...
<s> We're makin' moves on each other.
<s> You think I am in so deep I forgot?
<s> Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
<s> How do I discuss operations over an open line?
<s> "Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
<s> To recruit you.
<s> Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
<s> Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
<s> Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
<s> Goodbye.
<s> But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
<s> They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
<s> He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
<s> Bored.
<s> What's it say?
<s> Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
<s> They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
<s> Meaning...?
<s> Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
<s> Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
<s> Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
<s> Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
<s> Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
<s> Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
<s> Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
<s> I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
<s> You sure are a pretty lady.
<s> I ain't sleepy.
<s> For money for what?
<s> So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
<s> Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
<s> Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
<s> Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
<s> Who?
<s> How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
<s> Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
<s> This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
<s> No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
<s> Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
<s> KNOCK IT OFF!
<s> What?
<s> How's your hernia?
<s> Ziat!
<s> Stop shitting me, man!
<s> And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
<s> Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
<s> For the money... )
<s> Oh Jesus! 
<s> Sixty?
<s> But just...
<s> I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
<s> He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
<s> Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
<s> He wasn't even in the car?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah!
<s> I want to cut his throat.
<s> Then I'll cut his balls off.
<s> Oh shit.
<s> Maybe he's changing jobs.
<s> And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
<s> My passport!
<s> That's a great philosophy.
<s> If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
<s> Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
<s> Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
<s> What?
<s> Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
<s> Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
<s> Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
<s> Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
<s> Hurry, the woman needs help!
<s> Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
<s> "...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
<s> Please.
<s> Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
<s> Peter-
<s> The scent won't last...
<s> Try not to sweat?
<s> Peter...
<s> You the bug lady, right?
<s> No shit.
<s> What are they...?
<s> The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
<s> And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
<s> Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
<s> My pleasure.
<s> I'm getting to believe you.
<s> The Sistine Chapel?
<s> I'm...
<s> Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
<s> Perfect.
<s> Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
<s> It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
<s> I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
<s> You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
<s> --not fair?
<s> Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
<s> It looks wonderful. And so do you.
<s> My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
<s> The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
<s> It is.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
<s> I'm glad you like it.
<s> You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
<s> Oh, I like that tone.
<s> What is it?
<s> He's your client, huh?
<s> You think he might be missing?
<s> So do I...
<s> If I can.
<s> No, the typing kind.
<s> All done, chief..
<s> Mmmm.
<s> I suppose I did.
<s> Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
<s> And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
<s> Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
<s> And you're happy about that?
<s> A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
<s> Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
<s> Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
<s> Indeed.
<s> Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
<s> Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
<s> They've got a book for everything.
<s> You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
<s> I'd like a little more conviction..
<s> How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
<s> Yes?
<s> Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
<s> You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
<s> Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
<s> Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
<s> Twice.
<s> Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
<s> In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
<s> - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
<s> Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
<s> Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
<s> She sacrificed herself..
<s> By fire.  That's the best way, really.
<s> In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
<s> Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
<s> You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
<s> Good job.  And thanks.
<s> Do I?
<s> 'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
<s> By asking me.
<s> Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
<s> S.O.P..
<s> What about him...?
<s> Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
<s> Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
<s> Always.
<s> Krieger.
<s> Take off your God damn coat!
<s> I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
<s> You're sure about this?
<s> Theyre dead.
<s> Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
<s> Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
<s> Yeah.  I follow you.
<s> This whole operation was a molehunt.
<s> About what?
<s> Why don't you come back with me?
<s> You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
<s> Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
<s> Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
<s> Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
<s> Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
<s> I didn't touch it.
<s> Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
<s> No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
<s> You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
<s> If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Ill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
<s> Dont flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
<s> Loud and clear.
<s> Jack...that's spying.
<s> That's not so good for you, my friend.
<s> Connection denied.
<s> I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
<s> Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
<s> I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
<s> Thank you, Rose.
<s> I'm going to bed now.
<s> His brother.
<s> I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
<s> Hello, Mr. Castorini.
<s> You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
<s> I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
<s> You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
<s> You have too many dogs.
<s> Hurry up.
<s> Yes.
<s> Bus hit him.
<s> Why what?
<s> So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
<s> Just Johnny.
<s> Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
<s> All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
<s> You ruined my life.
<s> Oh no I didn't!
<s> I'm in love with you!
<s> Come on.
<s> I think that's it.
<s> That's right.
<s> I was.
<s> No.
<s> Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
<s> I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
<s> Johnny.
<s> My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
<s> Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
<s> I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
<s> How was your plane ride?
<s> And who's gonna pay for that?
<s> Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
<s> Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
<s> She recovered.
<s> That's a pretty big sin.
<s> You should think about this.
<s> I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
<s> If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
<s> Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
<s> Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
<s> Johnny...
<s> None of your business.
<s> That woman was a student of yours?
<s> There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
<s> Yes.
<s> What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
<s> Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
<s> The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
<s> Please!
<s> I'm not interested.
<s> I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
<s> What?
<s> I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
<s> So be it!
<s> Come on then.
<s> Had enough?
<s> Course I have.
<s> You'll what ... ?
<s> Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
<s> Of course not!  You are English pigs.
<s> Bedevere, my Liege.
<s> No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
<s> It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
<s> A G...g...g...
<s> Well ... I AM king.
<s> Yes, I see.
<s> Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
<s> Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
<s> I'm not dead!
<s> You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
<s> I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
<s> Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
<s> Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
<s> But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
<s> Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
<s> Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
<s> ... and you'll come and get him.
<s> Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
<s> The Prince ... ?
<s> You got my note!
<s> You've come to rescue me?
<s> That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
<s> Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
<s> Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
<s> So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
<s> Seventy a year.
<s> That's pretty good for a ghillie.
<s> You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
<s> So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
<s> But I'm the only one she trusts.
<s> You watch your tongue.
<s> Aye.
<s> She's busy.
<s> She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
<s> ... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
<s> It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
<s> That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
<s> How will I know what she requires?
<s> Maybe, once.
<s> I said.  I serve the Queen.
<s> The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
<s> See what?
<s> I'm glad of it.
<s> I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
<s> Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
<s> Who by?
<s> I do not accept.
<s> If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
<s> Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
<s> No, she wasn't.
<s> Of course.
<s> I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
<s> I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
<s> If I tell you, then it's no fun.
<s> What's the question mark?
<s> How do you do that?
<s> And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
<s> I came from the city on the left.
<s> Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
<s> No way.
<s> Laurie's.
<s> It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
<s> What?
<s> Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
<s> We're actually inside, aren't we?
<s> And then keep on driving?
<s> Well, it's a long story...
<s> Yes...
<s> You have no time.
<s> That's impossible.
<s> In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
<s> Can you say anything but "cool"?
<s> I'm going home Cynthia.
<s> I'm going home. I'll call you later.
<s> Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
<s> You gotta be kidding?
<s> There is no problem.
<s> No problem. What's on your mind?
<s> Whatever.
<s> You're an understandin' fella.
<s> The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
<s> That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
<s> Yes, he is. He raises corn.
<s> It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
<s> Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
<s> Right. See ya.
<s> May I have your name please?
<s> I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
<s> Maybe it's not me.
<s> I'm not sure about this.
<s> But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
<s> But I want to.
<s> Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
<s> No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
<s> It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
<s> Not a coke or anything?
<s> Where's the dock ?
<s> Yeah, I'd say that's it.
<s> I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
<s> We wait. This is an elevator.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
<s> I'm leaving.
<s> Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
<s> So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
<s> It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
<s> That's a shame.
<s> Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
<s> Because of my charming personality ?
<s> Not quite....
<s> Are you hunting wabbits ?
<s> Ow...
<s> In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
<s> You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
<s> Got it.
<s> And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
<s> Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
<s> Yeah, but we're talking 43.
<s> I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
<s> I am thirty two.
<s> Sir ?
<s> John, sir.
<s> Better, sir.
<s> Sir ?
<s> We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
<s> I have a turn for the worse for the team !
<s> Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
<s> Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
<s> He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
<s> What happened ?
<s> Do you want to go out with me ?
<s> Yes.
<s> What ?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Why don't you shut up now.
<s> Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
<s> I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
<s> Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
<s> Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
<s> And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
<s> I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
<s> You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
<s> How about a nice glass of milk?
<s> She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
<s> Oh.  Ohhh?
<s> Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
<s> I'd like to, thanks.
<s> 
<s> I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
<s> oh.
<s> You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
<s> It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
<s> No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
<s> I never met my mother.
<s> You're so clever.
<s> You're over reacting!
<s> Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
<s> WHAT??
<s> I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
<s> This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
<s> At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
<s> This isn't just a mood ring.
<s> Just give it to me!!
<s> DON'T, come on!!!
<s> Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
<s> Big deal.
<s> This is a totally barbaric custom.
<s> But we wouldn't really be related right?
<s> No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
<s> For the mini-bike fund.
<s> Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
<s> Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
<s> They're great.
<s> How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
<s> Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
<s> Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
<s> You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
<s> All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
<s> Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
<s> I was commenting on your hair.
<s> Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
<s> Oh, sure okay.
<s> Well you've gotta be prepared.
<s> This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
<s> I'm impressed.
<s> Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
<s> My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
<s> Deceased.
<s> Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
<s> You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
<s> Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
<s> What do you mean??
<s> I wrote that.
<s> What's that?
<s> Oh, how do you mean?
<s> I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
<s> It's nice.
<s> Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
<s> Is there enough room?
<s> I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
<s> Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
<s> Then who's it for?
<s> Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
<s> What?
<s> Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
<s> No, no.
<s> The last date I had was twenty years ago.
<s> Oh come on.
<s> Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
<s> Will you tell her I came by?
<s> It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
<s> Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
<s> Vada, this is an adult writing class.
<s> I wrote a poem too.
<s> Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
<s> I am.
<s> Chocolate?
<s> Can we look around in your camper?
<s> Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
<s> Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
<s> Well he just left, what's wrong?
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
<s> It'll bleed.
<s> A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
<s> What?
<s> Like they do on TV?
<s> But, I don't know how.
<s> Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
<s> He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
<s> We're about to find out.
<s> I can't even say it.
<s> To belong to someone.
<s> Can you watch the road?
<s> He said that, too.
<s> What? Because I'm a little understand...
<s> So your honeymoon is exactly where?
<s> It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
<s> ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
<s> What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
<s> This must be... very, very, hard on him.
<s> I love him.
<s> That's entirely understandable.
<s> I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
<s> I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
<s> I know Ben.
<s> Such as.
<s> Hate that.
<s> She finds him "personable."
<s> What, leaving school...
<s> You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
<s> Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
<s> Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
<s> ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
<s> Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
<s> "Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
<s> The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
<s> BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
<s> ... yeah, that.
<s> This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
<s> DON'T SPEAK!
<s> If you find her...
<s> Like family, huh?
<s> Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
<s> You got a real good memory, Star.
<s> I won first prize.
<s> Yes. I'm cutting a record.
<s> Don't feel that way, honey.
<s> You'll have to speak up.
<s> Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
<s> Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
<s> D.C.
<s> Bill, he's a crazy man.
<s> How come?
<s> What crook?
<s> No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
<s> Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Well, he's really amazing.
<s> No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
<s> I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
<s> Bet the sheets are grey.
<s> He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
<s> Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
<s> I'm here.
<s> Tom. You remember?
<s> I've got a gig tonight.
<s> End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
<s> I have to go. He sighs.
<s> Older.
<s> That's what you said before.
<s> I'm not sure...
<s> What?
<s> Fifteen minutes?
<s> What...?  0h, yes.
<s> You sound different. Is that really you?
<s> Eight-thirty in the chapel.
<s> You're real favorites of his.
<s> Out.
<s> They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
<s> Did it break?
<s> Do you study at all?
<s> Where is she?
<s> He ain't really new.
<s> You always live there?
<s> You think I should take lessons?
<s> Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
<s> More or less...
<s> Yes you are.
<s> Yes, they were.
<s> Are we in a big hurry?
<s> Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
<s> What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
<s> The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
<s> By all means.
<s> I see.
<s> Okay, Wayne, step forward.
<s> How 'bout Manson?
<s> All right, Mickey.
<s> Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
<s> That's indescribable.
<s> Sure.
<s> So, what now?
<s> You made every day like kindergarten.
<s> They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
<s> Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
<s> Yes.
<s> Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
<s> It's hard to say Capt'n.
<s> I hear ya. Play.
<s> What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
<s> Would the network really not run it without the interview?
<s> When do you want the assembly?
<s> Perfecto!
<s> Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
<s> Why?
<s> That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
<s> Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
<s> They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
<s> Lose 'em.
<s> Wayne, if it was anybody else---
<s> What are we talking about?
<s> I can't do that. Five guys.
<s> Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
<s> See Duff. He's the money man.
<s> I'll smile when it's funny.
<s> Where was that?
<s> Where's Wilma?
<s> Like where?
<s> Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
<s> You don't think much of yourself, do you?
<s> What is it?
<s> You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
<s> Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
<s> Oh yeah, and then what?
<s> Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
<s> All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
<s> Why did you?
<s> Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
<s> Well, what d'you think?
<s> Yeah?
<s> You didn't answer my question.
<s> We'll be all right.
<s> Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
<s> What the hell could you do?
<s> 'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
<s> Watch out!
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> There's nothing to say.
<s> When I get set, I'll send for you.
<s> Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
<s> 'Got a good thing, man.
<s> Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
<s> Great.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> She don't look no worse to me.
<s> Yeah, sure. Good luck.
<s> Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
<s> Sure.
<s> I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
<s> That's right.
<s> No, they won't.
<s> How are you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
<s> Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
<s> Anything you say, baby.
<s> Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
<s> Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
<s> Since when?
<s> Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
<s> Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
<s> He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
<s> You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
<s> First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
<s> Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
<s> The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
<s> I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
<s> Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
<s> Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
<s> You see the couple up in the balcony?
<s> I find out now.
<s> I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
<s> Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
<s> I don't have a girl.
<s> Yeah. That was me.
<s> As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
<s> This place empty as a tomb, mon.
<s> The girl 3Jane. We need her.
<s> Can you walk?
<s> Right...
<s> You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
<s> That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
<s> We got problems topside.
<s> How's the ice break?
<s> It's coming.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know. I don't know...
<s> Why would you want me to kill you?
<s> I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
<s> What?
<s> Almost two days.
<s> What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
<s> A regular Fagan.
<s> What went down between you and Riviera?
<s> Hold on.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
<s> Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
<s> College?
<s> Yes, it's lame.
<s> Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
<s> Leave.
<s> And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
<s> At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
<s> Anita!
<s> No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
<s> We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
<s> Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
<s> Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
<s> Why?
<s> You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
<s> Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
<s> Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
<s> Kristen got a quote?
<s> Hey. There.
<s> I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
<s> Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
<s> But I'm not a penguin.
<s> I'm Rob's prom date.
<s> No it's not. Guys name their penises.
<s> See!
<s> Don't you remember what they called you?
<s> No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
<s> Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
<s> Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
<s> And a gymnast!
<s> Really?
<s> Sorry. Forgetful.
<s> I don't have to say that.
<s> Why do you do that?
<s> But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
<s> What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
<s> Oh--yikes!
<s> Wow. You believe in me that much--
<s> Thanks. So do you.
<s> It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
<s> The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
<s> Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
<s> Yeah. Definitely.
<s> Maybe we should sit.
<s> Barrel.
<s> <i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<s> No!
<s> Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
<s> Oh, please...
<s> Only the wet ones.
<s> He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
<s> Shut up, Grady.
<s> Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
<s> Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
<s> I know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know - into the air I suppose.
<s> I don't know.  Where are we going?
<s> Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
<s> I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
<s> I'll get over it.
<s> Why won't you talk to me?
<s> I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
<s> How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
<s> Thanks, Mom.
<s> I thought I'd wait for you.
<s> It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
<s> Research.
<s> Wait and see.
<s> He's close...
<s> To old friends.
<s> When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah, but I was really not good.
<s> Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
<s> A little basic, but nice.
<s> Why is that?
<s> She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
<s> That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
<s> You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
<s> Sorry.
<s> That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
<s> Doesn't matter.
<s> I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
<s> Everybody take five.
<s> This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
<s> You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What?
<s> No.  We're alone.
<s> Mary Helena.
<s> I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
<s> Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
<s> For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
<s> This is stupid.
<s> I'm a vegetarian.
<s> Really, no.
<s> Thanks.  Well...
<s> Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
<s> Hello.
<s> No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
<s> You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
<s> What did you say?
<s> You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
<s> There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
<s> You've got to go.
<s> What do you think?
<s> You think I should do Henry James instead?
<s> It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
<s> Don't ask.
<s> I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
<s> That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
<s> I only found out you were here yesterday.
<s> Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
<s> Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
<s> I haven't decided.
<s> What's your name?
<s> And this is William.
<s> Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
<s> The movie star?
<s> Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
<s> ... get fired.
<s> He's cooking guinea fowl?
<s> Is Miss Scott staying here?
<s> Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
<s> Blimey.  What's that?
<s> Well, thanks, that's great.
<s> Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
<s> Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
<s> Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
<s> Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
<s> Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
<s> I believe I have.
<s> Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
<s> Point taken.
<s> Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
<s> Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
<s> Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
<s> Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
<s> I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
<s> Right -- let's talk about rent...
<s> I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
<s> What?
<s> No, Miss Ratched...
<s> I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
<s> I-I-I...
<s> Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
<s> Mister McMurphy!
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
<s> Sorry, ma'am.
<s> That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
<s> Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
<s> I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
<s> No, it was irresponsible!
<s> Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
<s> H-H-Hearts.
<s> What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
<s> Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
<s> O-o-o-oh...
<s> W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
<s> I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
<s> Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
<s> P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
<s> Yeah, Mack, what is it?
<s> They went that way.
<s> Huh?
<s> So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
<s> We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
<s> Through the ass.
<s> Me, too...
<s> Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
<s> Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
<s> No!
<s> No!
<s> I'm not running a charity ward...
<s> Just wait till you hear...
<s> Hit me.
<s> I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
<s> Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
<s> Yeah, it's cold!
<s> Hold it!
<s> Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
<s> I see.
<s> In what way?
<s> Arrested on an assault charge five times...
<s> Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
<s> Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
<s> 'Kay, Mac!
<s> Are you a doctor?
<s> Sure...
<s> Martini out!
<s> Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
<s> Okay. How you doing?
<s> You an' me, Chief.
<s> How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
<s> Oh, yeah...
<s> He's in charge.
<s> Hi.
<s> Big man!
<s> Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
<s> Thank you, ma'am,
<s> Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
<s> Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
<s> That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
<s> Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
<s> Of course not.
<s> I-- I must've misplaced it.
<s> I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
<s> It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
<s> My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
<s> Your great aunt.
<s> Hm.
<s> Who's this?
<s> Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
<s> I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
<s> He's safe.
<s> Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
<s> Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
<s> I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
<s> In that case... no...
<s> What?
<s> No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
<s> I can't believe you did that!
<s> Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
<s> Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
<s> No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
<s> There is no us.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Beautiful place...
<s> Just since yesterday.
<s> Really?
<s> Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
<s> You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
<s> Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
<s> I think he's having an affair.
<s> No...  I can just tell.
<s> It's a coincidence.
<s> You don't have a passport.
<s> My God, you have...
<s> You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
<s> Maybe.
<s> What is it?
<s> What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
<s> Because I'm the one who's single.
<s> Like a detective.
<s> Hi.  Where've you been?
<s> Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
<s> I'll be back before you leave.
<s> He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
<s> Is Damon Bradley here?
<s> Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
<s> She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
<s> A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
<s> You used to love it when I called you doll.
<s> Good strategy.
<s> Mania.
<s> Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
<s> I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
<s> When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!
<s> So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
<s> Gimme.
<s> So do I, Charley. For your sake.
<s> This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
<s> The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
<s> They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
<s> Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
<s> And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
<s> Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
<s> I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
<s> Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
<s> Why Edie, I
<s> Hello, Edie.
<s> Terry... Terry... .
<s> How about another one?
<s> Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
<s> I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
<s> What do they do for you, except get in your way?
<s> Why should I come hollering to you at all?
<s> How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
<s> He's going to have to grow up too.
<s> Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
<s> Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
<s> You are like
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> Good luck.
<s> Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
<s> Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
<s> Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
<s> Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
<s> Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
<s> What about it?
<s> O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
<s> I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
<s> You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
<s> I'm just resting my feet.
<s> You'll work.
<s> O.K., O.K., That's enough.
<s> Take it easy now, Terry.
<s> Forty-five bills.
<s> Gimme.
<s> Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this  to remember them by.
<s> Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
<s> Thanks, Johnny... .
<s> It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
<s> Now just a minute, I
<s> You ratted on us, Terry.
<s> Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
<s> I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
<s> When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
<s> Keep Charley out of this.
<s> I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
<s> I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
<s> I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
<s> Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
<s> Ahh, she will be yours.
<s> I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
<s> Yes, Master.
<s> Then why do you shake so?
<s> I'm so frightened.
<s> I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
<s> Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
<s> Aannnnaahhnn.
<s> Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
<s> Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
<s> They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Oh.  Uh-huh.
<s> Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
<s> Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
<s> That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
<s> The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
<s> Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
<s> He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
<s> Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
<s> Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
<s> Whatta you wanna do?
<s> I get that feeling, yeah.
<s> I'll go with you.
<s> Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
<s> Wait.  You not Adele?
<s> Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
<s> Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
<s> Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
<s> Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
<s> I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
<s> I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
<s> Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
<s> What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Sure.
<s> Faye Dunaway.
<s> With Robert Redford, when he was young.
<s> Really.
<s> And your gun.
<s> I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
<s> I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
<s> What, as a sales rep?
<s> I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
<s> Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
<s> He killed a police officer.
<s> Why are you mad?
<s> I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
<s> My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
<s> I see better with them on.
<s> In the trunk?
<s> I don't know...
<s> Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
<s> Really?  Well, I uhhh...
<s> No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
<s> Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
<s> First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
<s> Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
<s> I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
<s> Meaning time came, I left.
<s> I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
<s> That time?
<s> Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
<s> It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
<s> Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
<s> I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
<s> You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
<s> Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
<s> You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
<s> Great.  We got one of 'em.
<s> How you know that?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Thanks.
<s> You not with probation, one of those?
<s> What did you call it?
<s> Something better.  Open it.
<s> Off a tip?
<s> It's possible.  Why?
<s> That's right, just me.
<s> Where the fuck is Foley?
<s> Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
<s> If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
<s> Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
<s> Yes Sir.
<s> I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
<s> The one that slept in my mouth last night.
<s> You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
<s> A m-missionary?
<s> He did.
<s> Upset?  Why should I be upset?
<s> I was grieving too.
<s> You left her.  How's that for a fact?
<s> Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
<s> Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
<s> What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
<s> Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
<s> Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
<s> You were more like brothers.
<s> Well...sure.
<s> Thank you, Sir.
<s> Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
<s> I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
<s> Our doctor's gone too.
<s> Boxin'.
<s> Yes'm.
<s> Nice to meet you, Betty.
<s> You waited til tonight to tell me?
<s> I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
<s> How did you?...
<s> It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
<s> If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
<s> Learn English, then!
<s> If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
<s> The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
<s> We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
<s> It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
<s> I can't. It's all too much.
<s> Yes. Let's stay in touch.
<s> On what?
<s> What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
<s> Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
<s> Why do guys do such stupid things?
<s> Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
<s> You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
<s> I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
<s> Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
<s> They'll learn to live with it.
<s> I thought it had a lot of merit.
<s> Rejected, worthless, miserable.
<s> Great, isn't it?
<s> Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
<s> Is this slow enough for you?
<s> You're pretty charming when you want to be.
<s> But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
<s> Who?
<s> You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
<s> I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
<s> Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
<s> That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
<s> Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
<s> If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
<s> How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
<s> Charlie? Was I dead?
<s> Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
<s> What about Janet?
<s> I'll just set it right here.
<s> I'll never give up.
<s> She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
<s> What would that be, sir?
<s> Of course.
<s> Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
<s> Okay.
<s> But I'm remembering the future.
<s> It must run in the family.
<s> Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
<s> Don't you get along with your parents?
<s> Can we split now?
<s> Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
<s> Evelyn, put her to bed.
<s> It's not Charlie. It's me.
<s> It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
<s> Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
<s> This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
<s> Please don't shout.
<s> Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
<s> Why don't you go lie down for a while.
<s> I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
<s> I don't feel very festive.
<s> What does Charlie think about that?
<s> Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
<s> Rosalie Testa!
<s> You have an incredible memory.
<s> I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
<s> Are you doing some kind of science project?
<s> What's that?
<s> Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
<s> What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
<s> How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
<s> Wbat're you talking about?
<s> High tech. I like the sound of that.
<s> I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
<s> Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
<s> You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
<s> Well... uh... thanks...
<s> I had a little run-in with Zowie.
<s> It's been a few years.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'll be fine, Dad.
<s> It sucked.
<s> Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
<s> He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
<s> All set.
<s> Anywhere but here.
<s> You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
<s> You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
<s> You never get over it.
<s> Maybe it takes a while...
<s> I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
<s> All the time.
<s> Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
<s> He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
<s> I promise!
<s> Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
<s> I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
<s> Close the law book.
<s> The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
<s> Maybe you should think about it.
<s> About my blood work?
<s> Sounds delightful.
<s> I have AIDS.
<s> Little baby girl.
<s> Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
<s> I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
<s> Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
<s> Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
<s> What have you prayed for?
<s> There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
<s> What happens?
<s> I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
<s> Sure thing.
<s> Something like that.
<s> Not unnecessary ones.
<s> Yes.
<s> That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
<s> Thank you.
<s> All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
<s> I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
<s> Why are we going to do that?
<s> Right.
<s> Get real.
<s> Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Okay, Joe...
<s> Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
<s> A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
<s> Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
<s> Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
<s> You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
<s> <u>What</u>?
<s> Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
<s> I got the quick-and-ugly version.
<s> You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
<s> Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
<s> We can, can't we? Trust you?
<s> One or two.
<s> Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
<s> No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
<s> I can't....I can't....
<s> Don't do this to me....
<s> But they...they could still be....
<s> Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
<s> We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
<s> Can we switch?
<s> Like what?
<s> I assume he licked it clean.
<s> And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
<s> Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
<s> You coulda helped. And you didn't.
<s> We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
<s> Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
<s> So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
<s> Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
<s> One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
<s> We're all on the same hajj now.
<s> Rain.
<s> Which half?
<s> Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
<s> I'm born-again.
<s> The child heard you before any of us could even....
<s> I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
<s> Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
<s> Like an emergency life-raft, right?
<s> Say that again.
<s> Not afraid of the dark, are you?
<s> No. She's not.
<s> Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
<s> So which one caught your eye?
<s> What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
<s> Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
<s> Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
<s> Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
<s> It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
<s> To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
<s> Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
<s> Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
<s> And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
<s> No, they won't -
<s> It's probably wrong --
<s> Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
<s> But how long is a day?
<s> You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
<s> These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
<s> What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
<s> Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
<s> Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
<s> Sustained.
<s> Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
<s> Taylor.	I'm telling you --
<s> Don't bother
<s> So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
<s> Zira doesn't want your female.
<s> I'm for that.
<s> Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
<s> I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
<s> At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
<s> By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
<s> Read it yourself.
<s> Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
<s> Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
<s> I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
<s> That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
<s> Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
<s> Listen, listen -- I can speak --
<s> My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
<s> You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
<s> All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
<s> God bless you.
<s> Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
<s> Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
<s> ...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
<s> Fuck you bitch.
<s> Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
<s> Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
<s> Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
<s> Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
<s> Yeah.
<s> In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
<s> Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
<s> They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
<s> You know what I'm talking about!
<s> Found it. Growing in a garden.
<s> That's what he is... Baaaa!
<s> How far does this train go?
<s> Would you mind?
<s> How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
<s> Immigration Officer?
<s> What did you say his name was?
<s> As I said before...
<s> No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
<s> Whatever you say.
<s> Do you think I don't?
<s> You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
<s> Sure... but somebody always does..
<s> He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
<s> Bad enough.
<s> They know you here--know your name.
<s> All right--following me.
<s> Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
<s> Nothing matters.
<s> No percentage in that.
<s> You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
<s> Killaine's wise to what?
<s> Including Killaine.
<s> If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
<s> That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
<s> He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
<s> So that I will never be found.
<s> I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
<s> Magruder does.
<s> But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
<s> It is?
<s> Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
<s> Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
<s> We wouldn't have met at all.
<s> You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
<s> What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
<s> Because you think your in love with me?
<s> I'm not interested in blind dates.
<s> I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
<s> $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
<s> For five hundred, what do I get?
<s> You mentioned information.
<s> Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
<s> Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
<s> I don't.
<s> Would that make me a heel?
<s> Doesn't answer the question.
<s> Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
<s> She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
<s> Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
<s> I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
<s> What?
<s> Did I do something wrong?
<s> I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
<s> How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
<s> Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
<s> Open it and count it.
<s> So the shell ought to have gone over?
<s> I think so.
<s> If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
<s> Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
<s> Well.  What about it?
<s> Did we ever really think it was suicide?
<s> Positive?
<s> Not if it clears the air.
<s> Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
<s> That leaves two strangers.
<s> She might.
<s> I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
<s> Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
<s> Years, why?
<s> It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
<s> I say YES!
<s> He was delightful.
<s> Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
<s> To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
<s> If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
<s> I think you'll do very well.
<s> Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
<s> That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
<s> I'm not sure I can face it.
<s> Yes, please.
<s> And to history.
<s> Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
<s> I think she liked me.
<s> Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.
<s> We were just chortling over that. Blas and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
<s> You're so gross.
<s> We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
<s> On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
<s> Take a look at these.
<s> No, thanks Dad.
<s> No.
<s> We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
<s> It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
<s> Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
<s> Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
<s> Not yet.
<s> The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
<s> They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
<s> De nada.
<s> No, Bells Beach, Australia.
<s> Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
<s> So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
<s> Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
<s> You first!
<s> What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
<s> No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
<s> SHIT!!
<s> There's nobody else here...
<s> I take the skin off chicken.
<s> A little mushy.
<s> The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
<s> Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
<s> Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
<s> No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
<s> Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
<s> Figured you did.
<s> We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
<s> Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Warm them up.
<s> Tyler, put the gun down.
<s> No way, old buddy.
<s> No more games.
<s> Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
<s> Right behind you.
<s> What, Sergeant?
<s> Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
<s> That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
<s> I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
<s> I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
<s> I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
<s> You what?
<s> What?
<s> To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
<s> You've got a lot of nerve.
<s> I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
<s> How are you, Mr. Kross.
<s> I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
<s> Yes.
<s> You're not from L.A., huh?
<s> What?
<s> Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
<s> You mean they don't have hookers.
<s> Diet coke.
<s> I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
<s> Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
<s> You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
<s> I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
<s> "Occupational hazard".
<s> I have work to do.
<s> He died a long time ago.
<s> Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
<s> I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
<s> Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
<s> Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
<s> I more than liked it.
<s> It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
<s> It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
<s> I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
<s> Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
<s> Afternoon.
<s> Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
<s> Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
<s> Yes...
<s> Give me twenty minutes.
<s> I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
<s> Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
<s> Was that you?
<s> Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
<s> Yeah.  I just got it.
<s> Dummy.
<s> Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
<s> Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
<s> Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
<s> Me?
<s> Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
<s> I'm just looking, thanks.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
<s> I just might do that.
<s> Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
<s> I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
<s> Should I be?
<s> I do not marry tonight.
<s> You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
<s> Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
<s> No. No. We have already succeeded.
<s> What hideous sin have you committed lately?
<s> It never happened.
<s> You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
<s> Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
<s> Anybody want a peanut?
<s> I'm waiting!
<s> Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
<s> We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
<s> Yeah. It's really good.
<s> -- murdered by pirates is good --
<s> Because I can stop now if you want.
<s> Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
<s> All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Okay.
<s> Who won? How did it end?
<s> That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
<s> In that case --
<s> Stop saying that!
<s> -- offer me money --
<s> Hah?
<s> Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
<s> No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
<s> My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
<s> And what is that?
<s> No one of consequence.
<s> I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
<s> Inconceivable!
<s> -- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
<s> Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
<s> You've made your decision then7
<s> Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
<s> What?
<s> Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
<s> "Of the silvery moon,
<s> "To my honey I'll croon,
<s> How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
<s> Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
<s> I have hurt your feelings.
<s> In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
<s> I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
<s> Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
<s> You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
<s> Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
<s> But what if the play was a hit?
<s> What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
<s> No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
<s> You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
<s> You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
<s> I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
<s> I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
<s> I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
<s> I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
<s> You found a flop!
<s> Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
<s> Liebkind, no!
<s> Really, I never dreamed ...
<s> We swear it!
<s> Yes.  We would!
<s> All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
<s> Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
<s> All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
<s> Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
<s> Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
<s> No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
<s> And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
<s> Of Siegfried...
<s> Wagner...
<s> Heil you know who!
<s> OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
<s> No.
<s> Or arrived with her.
<s> Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
<s> Anyone at home?
<s> Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
<s> Not even a hunch. Just hope.
<s> Can I trade in my car and take another?
<s> No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
<s> Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
<s> What difference does that...
<s> Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
<s> Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
<s> You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sam.
<s> Without calling me?
<s> Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
<s> What makes you sound so certain?
<s> Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
<s> When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
<s> I've lost my girlish laughter.
<s> Sam! No!
<s> Thank you. Again.
<s> Uncommon, too.
<s> No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
<s> I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
<s> Very early. Dawn.
<s> Good night.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Now what?
<s> It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
<s> Do what?
<s> Mother, please...
<s> He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
<s> This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
<s> Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
<s> What--special autopsy?
<s> Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
<s> Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
<s> How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
<s> Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
<s> Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
<s> Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
<s> Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
<s> It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
<s> Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
<s> Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
<s> I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
<s> Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
<s> I'm not quarreling, only ...
<s> At any time. You will always be welcome.
<s> And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
<s> You mean he was colored?
<s> Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
<s> Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
<s> That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
<s> If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
<s> Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
<s> Nope, I'm through!
<s> Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
<s> All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
<s> Almost certain.
<s> Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
<s> Don't remember what day that was, do you?
<s> Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
<s> Old Howard Winton's cub?
<s> Hotcha! Saved, one job!
<s> Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
<s> Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
<s> My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
<s> I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
<s> You go in for dangerous things.
<s> I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
<s> No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
<s> Heaven knows. A lot.
<s> One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
<s> That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
<s> Yes.
<s> You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
<s> Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I'm heading out of town.
<s> Where to?
<s> That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
<s> Is Rose here?
<s> I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
<s> But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
<s> You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
<s> Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
<s> There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
<s> I said I wouldn't.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He did?
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
<s> Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
<s> Yeah, he's still up there.
<s> Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
<s> No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
<s> What did you say, Brother?
<s> She's getting herself up to go out.
<s> She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
<s> Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
<s> I think Daddy suspects.
<s> At least.
<s> Here comes Daddy.
<s> No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
<s> Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
<s> It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
<s> Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
<s> Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
<s> Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
<s> Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
<s> There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
<s> I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
<s> That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
<s> You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
<s> What time is it?
<s> Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
<s> She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
<s> She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
<s> That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
<s> Over... my... dead... body!
<s> Fine.
<s> Don't make me... me... me... get up!
<s> Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
<s> There are more on the other side.
<s> Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Well. What kinda job is it?
<s> Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
<s> Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
<s> Page proof of a book I'm working on.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
<s> She has other things to do, Dave.
<s> Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
<s> What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
<s> Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
<s> Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
<s> Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
<s> Be quiet, Rose.
<s> Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
<s> Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
<s> It'll get better now.
<s> What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
<s> ... okay... you made your point.
<s> I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
<s> Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
<s> Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
<s> I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
<s> If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
<s> Alright!  Alright... put me down...
<s> I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
<s> Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
<s> Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
<s> Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
<s> Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
<s> They shot us all, kid.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
<s> No, but it should.
<s> Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
<s> If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
<s> I... I think I can... clarify...
<s> Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
<s> Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
<s> You are such a disappointment, Benny.
<s> What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
<s> First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
<s> All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
<s> Let's hope.
<s> Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
<s> Whatever goes bang.
<s> A.D. is a C.P.A.
<s> So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
<s> When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
<s> That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
<s> All right. Stand by.
<s> You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
<s> Yoda spoke of another.
<s> Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
<s> That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
<s> There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
<s> I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
<s> Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
<s> Hold me.
<s> All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
<s> Lando!
<s> No, wait! I thought you were blind!
<s> It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
<s> I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
<s> Oh, no.
<s> I see them. Wait, Leia!
<s> Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
<s> I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
<s> Oh. Well, yes.
<s> I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
<s> Certainly not!
<s> I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
<s> Janet.
<s> I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
<s> For you.
<s> Dammit, Janet.
<s> Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
<s> I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
<s> So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
<s> Makes you cry
<s> Now I
<s> Oh my, my,
<s> Free to try and find a game
<s> Oh no no no no.
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
<s> Oh.
<s> They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
<s> Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
<s> I don't think you're a bum.
<s> I wanna let my brother know where I am.
<s> It's not that --
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> No... Sharp -- You look great.
<s> -- The legs.
<s> ...What?
<s> Paulie!
<s> Fouls.
<s> ...Still don't feel no heat.
<s> Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
<s> ...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
<s> Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
<s> Charge it.
<s> I agree.
<s> What's happenin' here?
<s> Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
<s> Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
<s> Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
<s> Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
<s> Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
<s> ...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
<s> What'd you say?
<s> Stuff it, man!
<s> I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
<s> ...Tomato?
<s> Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
<s> Ya puttin' me on?
<s> Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
<s> I never had good footwork.
<s> Yo, Benny.
<s> Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
<s> Yo, can I have my locker back?
<s> Bullmastiff.
<s> What?
<s> Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
<s> Maybe ya should see a doctor.
<s> Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
<s> I dunno -- she fills gaps.
<s> Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
<s> Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
<s> So where is it then?
<s> Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
<s> What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
<s> No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
<s> He's a Toon... who cares?
<s> Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
<s> They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
<s> That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
<s> If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
<s> That's what you woke me up for?
<s> That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
<s> One too many safes dropped on his head?
<s> Have you got the will?
<s> Divorce?  Never!
<s> I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
<s> Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
<s> Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
<s> Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
<s> You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
<s> And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
<s> Get away from there.
<s> How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
<s> I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
<s> I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
<s> And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
<s> Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
<s> The what?
<s> Good-morrow, cousin.
<s> In love?
<s> Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
<s> Teach me how I should forget to think.
<s> Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
<s> If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
<s> Be not so long to speak I long to die.
<s> No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
<s> Romeo, I drink to thee.
<s> O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
<s> Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
<s> Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
<s> Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
<s> Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
<s> More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
<s> Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
<s> Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
<s> In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
<s> Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
<s> Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
<s> Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
<s> Could you not take some occasion without giving?
<s> What wouldst thou have with me?
<s> I am for you.
<s> Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
<s> As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
<s> What?
<s> How do we know that?
<s> Best beer in the world known to man or God.
<s> I thought I did.
<s> Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
<s> They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
<s> They're good!
<s> No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
<s> You were a soldier, were you?
<s> You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
<s> I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
<s> Don't even think that I'm buying that.
<s> Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
<s> There's a problem...
<s> Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
<s> He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
<s> I take it you still want the money...
<s> No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
<s> I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
<s> Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
<s> I sent it to myself in Paris.
<s> Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
<s> I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
<s> No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
<s> Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
<s> Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
<s> I didn't expect that he would.
<s> Why don't you go do better, then...
<s> Who's they?
<s> You should learn a little patience.
<s> As in, they own it?
<s> Jujitsu.
<s> It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
<s> That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
<s> I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
<s> You were smoking?
<s> But you can't.
<s> We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
<s> You see the bullet?
<s> I know of him.
<s> I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
<s> Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
<s> Finish it!
<s> What?
<s> Gone.  Destroyed.
<s> How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
<s> You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
<s> I'm alright.  And you?
<s> Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
<s> Seven thousand...
<s> Why?  Are you kidding me?
<s> Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
<s> What makes you so sure?
<s> Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
<s> He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
<s> You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
<s> Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
<s> Okay then.  I'll do it.
<s> Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
<s> All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
<s> Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
<s> I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
<s> There it is...now what about the others?
<s> You killed him...
<s> It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
<s> Then we're screwed.
<s> That's right.
<s> It's NOT too late!
<s> Rock solid.
<s> What are you proposing?
<s> No.  It's not.
<s> No.  Why?
<s> What for?
<s> I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
<s> I don't know.  My friends...
<s> You know I do.
<s> Could it have been this?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
<s> What?
<s> We appreciate that.
<s> Why would someone do that?
<s> Did you say After Midnight?
<s> So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
<s> Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
<s> Well I just uh, you know...
<s> No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
<s> Yeah whaddya want?.
<s> So be here at three.
<s> Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
<s> I don't know...
<s> I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
<s> What?
<s> Well you're not getting, either.
<s> We're gonna talk.
<s> Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
<s> Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
<s> We're going to find out.
<s> Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
<s> I'd like to see you try.
<s> Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
<s> We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
<s> So what's your story?
<s> In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
<s> It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
<s> Lee, you okay?
<s> Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
<s> You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
<s> I knew you were lying.
<s> You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
<s> How you doin'?
<s> Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
<s> Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
<s> Detective Yu?  Never met him.
<s> I'm okay, you go.
<s> Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
<s> Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
<s> You pull a muscle or something?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> What did you say?
<s> Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
<s> She never even looked at you.
<s> Shhh, my head hurts.
<s> We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
<s> I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
<s> They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
<s> Who's Benjamin?
<s> Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
<s> Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
<s> No.  I'm going to find out.
<s> She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
<s> It's okay, I got lots more.
<s> The Plaza Hotel?
<s> Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
<s> And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
<s> I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
<s> How do I know I can trust you?
<s> It's my responsibility.
<s> Put the plates down.  It's over.
<s> Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
<s> OK. Say what it is.
<s> I know, but --
<s> Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
<s> Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
<s> Witnesses.
<s> Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
<s> Don't go there...
<s> Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
<s> Yes, I know this song.
<s> Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
<s> No, fish is a PM food.
<s> I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
<s> It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
<s> No...what?
<s> It's okay. For restaurants.
<s> We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
<s> I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
<s> I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I'm waitin' here for a name.
<s> Let me take you back inside, okay?
<s> Thank you.
<s> What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
<s> What did he ask?
<s> I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
<s> Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
<s> He's here!... He's here!
<s> Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
<s> "Make the shot."
<s> I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
<s> But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Then come for dinner.
<s> Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
<s> And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
<s> Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
<s> Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
<s> Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
<s> Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
<s> He is not!
<s> Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
<s> Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
<s> Six-fifty.
<s> Cindy the manicurist.
<s> He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
<s> You don't know.
<s> No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
<s> Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
<s> Of what?
<s> Missed me bad, huh?
<s> Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
<s> No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
<s> I kissed him back.
<s> Me?
<s> And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
<s> So am I.
<s> Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
<s> Yup!
<s> It's probably because you got him fired.
<s> Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
<s> "And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
<s> No, you tell her.
<s> Houseboats don't go anywhere.
<s> -- who's married to --
<s> -- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
<s> He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
<s> Walter, I'd love to --
<s> I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
<s> Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
<s> You couldn't.
<s> I should say something in this about magic.
<s> "I want to meet you..."
<s> That's impossible.  A guy can't --
<s> Listen to this, I love this part --
<s> I know.
<s> You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
<s> I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
<s> That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
<s> Becky?
<s> Is this crazy?
<s> Thank you.  I love you.
<s> You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
<s> It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
<s> No, I'm not. 
<s> A sense of humor.
<s> Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
<s> I want my money.
<s> That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
<s> And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
<s> Come on, Jonah --
<s> Sure you do --
<s> The cabinets have to be redone --
<s> The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
<s> Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
<s> I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
<s> I don't think I could really describe it.
<s> Right, right.
<s> Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
<s> What's tira misu?
<s> Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
<s> You think so?
<s> I don't get it.
<s> What is it?
<s> P.  Dad?
<s> Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
<s> Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
<s> What do you think?
<s> What?
<s> Whose show was this on?
<s> The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
<s> Oh, right.
<s> There she is.
<s> No.
<s> It's a short word.
<s> This is the one I like.
<s> If I didn't go.
<s> Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
<s> Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
<s> You must be Jonah.
<s> You look good yourself.
<s> You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
<s> I read the same article...
<s> Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
<s> No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
<s> There's nothing stopping you.
<s> I don't make policy.
<s> You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
<s> The woman question?
<s> You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
<s> Later. When I finish the ironing.
<s> They are singing for me.
<s> Yes. We will light the candles.
<s> I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
<s> What's more important than sanitation?
<s> If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
<s> It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
<s> He'll have it good. Some day.
<s> The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
<s> There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
<s> I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
<s> No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
<s> You weren't waiting for me.
<s> Be still ...
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
<s> Shut up, you're talking crazy.
<s> Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
<s> Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
<s> Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
<s> Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
<s> I thought maybe you forgot...
<s> I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
<s> The what!
<s> You should have helped her without being asked.
<s> You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
<s> Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not even a guess?
<s> Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
<s> I understand. Thanks anyway.
<s> I was thinking Alice Cooper.
<s> Leave me out of this.
<s> No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
<s> It's me.
<s> Please open the door, Danny.
<s> Find a new job.
<s> You always been this stubborn?
<s> Danny, it's not what you think.
<s> I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
<s> Guess it's our turn.
<s> Why's that?
<s> You don't say.
<s> Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
<s> Wait till I tell you what it is.
<s> When? When did you ever see me use?
<s> Secret recipe.
<s> Make me an offer.
<s> I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
<s> Pull your pants down.
<s> Please .. I don't know what you're ...
<s> Just some buddies.
<s> Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
<s> Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
<s> Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
<s> Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
<s> Whata you mean?  He told me -
<s> Jesus.
<s> It speaks!
<s> Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
<s> Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
<s> Who the hell is Jimmy?
<s> That would be me.
<s> Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
<s> I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
<s> That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
<s> Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
<s> Maybe he isn't showing.
<s> So they travel around from place to place and preach?
<s> They got squirrels there, too, right?
<s> Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
<s> Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
<s> Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
<s> Gives Wade the second shot.
<s> White-walls?
<s> Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
<s> I don't expect to live that long.
<s> You don't count.
<s> They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
<s> How about you shut up and take your position?
<s> Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
<s> I think you're right, Keith.
<s> Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
<s> Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
<s> Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
<s> Sure, what do you want to know?
<s> Ours is not to reason why.
<s> Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
<s> I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
<s> Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
<s> But we accomplish the mission.
<s> Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
<s> Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
<s> Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
<s> Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
<s> Struggling with a pair of Germans.
<s> Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
<s> Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
<s> Lingerie.
<s> Get lost.
<s> Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
<s> Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
<s> Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
<s> Don't let your father's business infect your life.
<s> Because he's guilty.
<s> We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
<s> Understanding the following rights...
<s> So you refuse to answer my questions?
<s> You're sure?
<s> Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
<s> Read it.
<s> Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
<s> Look at his face, he did the deed.
<s> I just saw Joe.  He's here.
<s> It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
<s> One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
<s> He'd like to start serving immediately.
<s> 'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
<s> Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
<s> I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
<s> Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
<s> Okay, I give up.
<s> Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
<s> I like him a lot.
<s> Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
<s> Just finishing up in here.
<s> Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
<s> Yes, I...
<s> Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
<s> Hi.  You called me?
<s> Yeah.  What a day.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
<s> No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
<s> They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
<s> No.
<s> It's the worst job since keymaster.
<s> Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
<s> I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
<s> Come on.
<s> Okay, bye, I will.
<s> Be friends?
<s> You're cold.
<s> It was wonderful.
<s> We decided...
<s> I think that we should stop going out on dates.
<s> No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
<s> Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
<s> I love you.  Please, I love you.
<s> Okay, good, this is all very noble.
<s> Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
<s> Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
<s> Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
<s> You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
<s> Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
<s> Very talented.
<s> I know this part, keep reading.
<s> So what's up?
<s> I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
<s> Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
<s> I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
<s> How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
<s> Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
<s> A charade?  How could it be a charade?
<s> Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
<s> I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
<s> Nice things cost money.
<s> I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
<s> Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
<s> Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
<s> Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
<s> There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
<s> Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
<s> Did it?
<s> Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
<s> "And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
<s> She dumped me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think it's out of your control.
<s> Let us decide that.
<s> Damned if I know. She ditched me.
<s> Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
<s> Not good.
<s> ..and as lonely as I am...
<s> Over here.
<s> C'mon. Let's go.
<s> Don't worry...
<s> I'll give you one guess.
<s> Watch your back.
<s> I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
<s> Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
<s> Where is your attacker?
<s> Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
<s> Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
<s> No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
<s> No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
<s> It's not a good idea, Hallie.
<s> Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
<s> But...
<s> Gale?
<s> What's your favorite scary movie?
<s> Closer than you think.
<s> Where you going?
<s> Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
<s> Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
<s> That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
<s> I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
<s> Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
<s> Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
<s> In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
<s> But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
<s> Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
<s> Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
<s> I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
<s> Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
<s> He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
<s> I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
<s> Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
<s> Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
<s> This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
<s> Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
<s> You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
<s> Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
<s> Someone stole Sid's file?
<s> I happen to work for the police god dammit!
<s> It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
<s> I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
<s> No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
<s> I am Gale Weathers!
<s> Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
<s> This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
<s> Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
<s> I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
<s> Are you sure?
<s> You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
<s> You know it.
<s> And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
<s> Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
<s> I just wanted to see her, that's all.
<s> Oh it did?
<s> What's that?
<s> When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
<s> Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
<s> Stop it!
<s> Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
<s> I don't know.
<s> You have to have a favorite.
<s> NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
<s> Or else what?
<s> Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
<s> Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
<s> Your call.
<s> Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
<s> Deputy... good evening.
<s> What kind of lead?
<s> Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
<s> I'll get my camera.
<s> ...yeah...
<s> Afraid not.
<s> Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
<s> What were you doing out here?
<s> How is she?
<s> Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
<s> You think he could still be in town?
<s> What is it? Where's Casey?
<s> The phone's dead.
<s> I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
<s> Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
<s> What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
<s> He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
<s> Ricki Lake.
<s> Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
<s> So who are you?
<s> So where are you?
<s> That's the original part.
<s> Sleep tight, sweetie.
<s> Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
<s> What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
<s> Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
<s> You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
<s> He was there, Tatum.
<s> And you believe it?
<s> Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
<s> I don't know, they just did.
<s> Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
<s> Tits -- see.
<s> Give it to me.
<s> He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
<s> This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
<s> Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
<s> He's not finished.
<s> Turn around.  Hands on your head!
<s> You'll see.
<s> Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
<s> You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
<s> I seem to remember knocking on your door.
<s> It's close.
<s> What?
<s> Whoa, whoa... what?!
<s> Can we talk about this in private?
<s> All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
<s> Forced what?
<s> None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
<s> It's got to be.
<s> Just wait!
<s> Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
<s> Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
<s> Satisfy our curiosity?
<s> I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
<s> I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
<s> This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
<s> Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
<s> I don't know... like fifty.
<s> It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
<s> How is this legal?
<s> We're focusing.
<s> That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
<s> We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> We had him.
<s> Then, he must write about these murders.
<s> Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
<s> How can you say that?  Especially after today?
<s> Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
<s> Big surprise.
<s> Wait!
<s> Oh... um, William.
<s> What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
<s> High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
<s> I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
<s> If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
<s> It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
<s> They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
<s> Why don't you finish the job?
<s> That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
<s> Huh...? No...no water.
<s> She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
<s> No sir...pleasure.
<s> Dunno...Seems so.
<s> Yes sir...
<s> You fit a lot of descriptions.
<s> You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
<s> There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
<s> God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
<s> Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
<s> You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
<s> Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
<s> Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
<s> Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
<s> Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
<s> In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
<s> That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
<s> Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
<s> Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
<s> Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
<s> An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
<s> Good night...
<s> Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
<s> Oh...
<s> Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
<s> Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
<s> What's goin' on?
<s> Not far from it...
<s> I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
<s> From the beginning...
<s> Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
<s> No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
<s> It isn't fair...
<s> You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
<s> We got two around that age...
<s> Oh, damnit!
<s> Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
<s> Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
<s> And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
<s> Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
<s> What are you talking about-
<s> But what is the truth?
<s> We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
<s> Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
<s> Yes.
<s> My Massacre at Paris is complete.
<s> Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
<s> You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
<s> Ned is wrong for it.
<s> Yes, I saw it.
<s> Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
<s> Partners!
<s> Of course not!
<s> Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
<s> Every word.
<s> She is always Aphrodite.
<s> What piece? Richard Crookback?
<s> Who wrote that?
<s> I did not.
<s> Tomorrow
<s> We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
<s> I don't know, it's a mystery.
<s> How goes it, Will?
<s> Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
<s> Mercutiogood name.
<s> "Not having that which, having, makes them short."
<s> All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
<s> Verona again.
<s> Your Majesty.
<s> "Madam!"
<s> "Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
<s> So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
<s> Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
<s> What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
<s> You cannot, Wessex will kill you
<s> I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
<s> and thus unable to declare her love
<s> Do you intend to marry, my lord?
<s> Virginia?!
<s> Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
<s> It is to be expected on a Sunday.
<s> My hat?
<s> Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
<s> Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
<s> For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
<s> It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
<s> A man, my lord?
<s> A theatre poet?
<s> Will you shut up and play.
<s> Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
<s> It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
<s> Think about it.
<s> Come on, David.
<s> All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
<s> You call them if you want.
<s> Can we talk about something?
<s> Just stop worrying.
<s> I want to talk now.
<s> Now.
<s> Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
<s> I don't know.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
<s> I don't know.
<s> Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
<s> This is just an informal discussion.
<s> Well, then?
<s> Take another look at these two.
<s> And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
<s> No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
<s> That's all?
<s> Yes.
<s> OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
<s> I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're right.
<s> No. Any idea which channel he's on?
<s> Yes.
<s> What? What's wrong?
<s> I thought we all were.
<s> But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
<s> OK.
<s> I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
<s> It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
<s> Are you all right?
<s> Then let's spend some money.
<s> Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
<s> Oh, good.
<s> Everything.
<s> Alex.
<s> The perfect couple, I should say.
<s> Let him go. Let him take it all.
<s> Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
<s> And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
<s> Yes, absolutely.
<s> Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
<s> Someone lost the key.
<s> That wasn't a question.
<s> Did you ever kill a man?
<s> Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
<s> You paid two hundred pounds for this?
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
<s> Would you like to see the rest?
<s> Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
<s> Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
<s> No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
<s> No. But he needs treatment.
<s> What?
<s> And what do you recognize, names or faces?
<s> Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
<s> No, it's a very groovy girl.
<s> Who?
<s> -- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
<s> That's okay too.
<s> I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
<s> Gee, that's very serious...
<s> Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
<s> I don't want to see you anymore.
<s> What?
<s> Why don't you see Lester?
<s> She's a friend of Jill's.
<s> What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
<s> Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
<s> Am I what?
<s> I am not!
<s> They are?
<s> Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
<s> Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
<s> I've got heads here, Norman.
<s> -- Yeah... your car down here?
<s> Jill's really great, isn't she?
<s> He's a very private person, actually.
<s> Okay.
<s> And what?
<s> I won't screw you up.
<s> Hey, I don't tell.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You did, I know you did.
<s> Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
<s> Sammy's?
<s> The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
<s> -- look, you don't have to entertain me...
<s> Mmmm --
<s> -- yes, you --
<s> Not me, pal.
<s> What?
<s> Don't leave me...
<s> She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
<s> She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
<s> Wash her.
<s> I don't know if you don't know --
<s> -- oh -- sweetheart...
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Where?
<s> Who?
<s> No shit?
<s> Keep moving --
<s> Honey, what happened?
<s> I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
<s> What!
<s> Your advice!
<s> I'll call you.
<s> Who?
<s> A business meeting, I told you that.
<s> -- she's a very compulsive girl.
<s> I do, Jill.
<s> Yes.
<s> How many?
<s> I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
<s> I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
<s> ... honest. At least you're honest with me.
<s> What did you say?
<s> But Mr. Norman said --
<s> I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
<s> I'm better than the guy I work for.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Sure.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Okay.
<s> ... this doing hair it's...
<s> I don't know what to...
<s> Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
<s> What, do you think I planned it?
<s> ... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
<s> What about her?
<s> No.
<s> A soap?
<s> That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
<s> How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
<s> Is that right?
<s> I am?
<s> Don't be silly.
<s> Well, it's George.
<s> Well, you know what I mean.
<s> I'm exaggerating.
<s> Well yes -- you know that about George.
<s> Didn't you have any panties on?
<s> What did you do?
<s> Is he an enemy?
<s> I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
<s> -- no.
<s> Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
<s> -- these bastards have me hemmed in.
<s> Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
<s> -- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
<s> Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
<s> Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
<s> Come here for a minute, first.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yes, Dad.
<s> Yeah.
<s> How does he tell you things?
<s> Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
<s> Okay...oh!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Danny, come here!
<s> Talking to Tony.
<s> No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
<s> Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
<s> Do I have to?
<s> Yes.
<s> Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
<s> Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
<s> Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
<s> A nigger.
<s> A nigger cook.
<s> There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
<s> I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> Thank you for saying so.
<s> It's good to be back, Lloyd.
<s> Your money's no good here.
<s> Hi, hon.  How's it going?
<s> Hmm, nice.
<s> I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
<s> Why?
<s> I'm not going to hurt you.
<s> Stop swinging the bat.
<s> Yes?
<s> Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
<s> Well...
<s> shut in together over long periods of time.
<s> Oh, I'll say.
<s> How do you do?
<s> Eight thirty.
<s> Fine.
<s> Blue. This blue.
<s> Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
<s> What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
<s> Jane-
<s> For getting a divorce?
<s> What kind of noises?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
<s> What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
<s> You're not going to let it go, are you?
<s> The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
<s> Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
<s> Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
<s> We won't!
<s> Really?
<s> LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
<s> I think they hear you!
<s> SING!
<s> Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
<s> What did who say?
<s> You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
<s> Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
<s> That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
<s> D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
<s> Why?
<s> Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
<s> Because we're
<s> Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
<s> I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Um, I don't really know this one...
<s> Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
<s> I knew that.
<s> Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
<s> That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
<s> You re okay -- for a civilian.
<s> An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> You watch yourself!
<s> Honey.
<s> Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
<s> Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
<s> A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
<s> Bless you.
<s> Don't you know it!
<s> You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
<s> What?
<s> Would you like that?
<s> Silence?  No talking?  All day?
<s> My what?
<s> It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
<s> Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
<s> Mary Clarence!
<s> Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
<s> I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
<s> No.  No.
<s> Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
<s> The majority has spoken.
<s> 'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
<s> Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
<s> Then-you run.
<s> Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
<s> It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
<s> Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
<s> But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
<s> Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
<s> That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
<s> I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
<s> Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
<s> It didn't work, Vince.
<s> Which one!
<s> Neither did you!
<s> Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
<s> But how do we get there?
<s> Christy.
<s> Yes?
<s> St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
<s> It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
<s> Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
<s> You will stay at her side?
<s> All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
<s> Protest to my superiors if you like.
<s> Does that look like an animal hanging?
<s> I am the Lord's voice in this town.
<s> I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
<s> Hmm?  See them?
<s> Master Hardenbrook...
<s> I shall, gladly.
<s> Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
<s> The Western Woods.
<s> Listen.
<s> True enough.
<s> Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
<s> And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
<s> Lady Van Tassel.
<s> Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
<s> I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
<s> Lady Van Tassel...
<s> I doubt that's the end.
<s> Tired.
<s> The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
<s> I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
<s> I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
<s> Yes, he does.  May I try?
<s> If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
<s> No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
<s> You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
<s> She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
<s> What did you say?
<s> It was you there?
<s> I do not know.  Away.
<s> His horse.
<s> Keep climbing.  I will follow...
<s> I... I can't do this.
<s> It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
<s> Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
<s> I didn't see none.
<s> Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
<s> Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
<s> I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
<s> See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
<s> Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
<s> He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
<s> I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
<s> Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
<s> You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
<s> I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
<s> See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
<s> I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
<s> You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
<s> Don't tell me what to do.
<s> That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
<s> Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
<s> Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
<s> Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
<s> Childers.
<s> Childers.
<s> They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
<s> I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
<s> He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
<s> How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
<s> Hit was right thoughty of her.
<s> Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
<s> Naw.
<s> Yeah.
<s> My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
<s> I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
<s> Yes sir, I reckon it does.
<s> I reckon.
<s> I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
<s> Is that right?
<s> We'll be on teams, me and you?
<s> I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
<s> Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
<s> No sir.
<s> Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
<s> I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
<s> I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
<s> Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
<s> Did Vaughan go home?
<s> Did Karl go to bed?
<s> He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
<s> I ain't got no boy.
<s> Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
<s> I never was no good with history.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
<s> No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
<s> I've heard it said that way.
<s> That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
<s> Can I help you, sir?
<s> Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
<s> I knew he slept in a toolshed.
<s> Before they were married?
<s> How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
<s> Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
<s> We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
<s> As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> Actually, I'm his father.
<s> Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
<s> I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
<s> For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
<s> What's that, Sol?
<s> Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
<s> That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
<s> That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
<s> It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
<s> Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
<s> Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
<s> Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
<s> Ready. Any time you are.
<s> Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
<s> I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
<s> I mean, it's a good story.
<s> Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
<s> Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
<s> I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
<s> Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
<s> Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
<s> I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
<s> Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
<s> She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
<s> They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
<s> Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
<s> Sure thing. See you later.
<s> You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
<s> I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
<s> I think I'll take them. 
<s> How the hell did you get into the building?
<s> He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
<s> I shouldn't have let him go.
<s> And you told your nephew about it?
<s> Jesus.
<s> Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
<s> That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
<s> Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
<s> Well what?
<s> An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
<s> Yeah? And why is that?
<s> Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
<s> I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
<s> The what?
<s> But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
<s> Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
<s> Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
<s> Nice drawing. Did you do that?
<s> I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
<s> It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
<s> How long have you been here?
<s> It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
<s> Take good care of yourself, okay?
<s> I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
<s> You don't really want to know.
<s> Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
<s> No way.
<s> The end.
<s> Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
<s> Is it yours?
<s> No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
<s> That money is my whole future.
<s> Wow. They sure did a job on you.
<s> Hot coffee or iced coffee?
<s> Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
<s> If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
<s> Yes, please.
<s> You done your math right.
<s> Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
<s> Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
<s> Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
<s> Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
<s> Easy.  Slow is best.
<s> Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
<s> He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
<s> Objection!  Speculation.
<s> But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
<s> That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
<s> That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<s> Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
<s> I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
<s> Yes.
<s> Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
<s> To my father.  Everything counts.
<s> That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
<s> Still lashed to the mast.
<s> We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
<s> Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
<s> That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
<s> I want you.  To tell the truth.
<s> Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
<s> If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
<s> Sure, anything's poss...
<s> But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
<s> Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
<s> Carl never lied.
<s> I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
<s> Such as?
<s> Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
<s> Yes.  And that one, too.
<s> Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
<s> I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
<s> All right, girls - from the top again.
<s> Funny?  In what way?
<s> Thank you ever so.
<s> Fresh!
<s> I'll say.
<s> First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
<s> I told you - it's a sure thing.
<s> Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
<s> Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
<s> So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
<s> I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
<s> As far away as possible.
<s> The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
<s> And I'm Daphne.
<s> Watch it, Daphne!
<s> Now you tore the other one.
<s> You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
<s> What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
<s> Daphne, you're bothering us.
<s> And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
<s> Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
<s> Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
<s> But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
<s> We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
<s> I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
<s> We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> When?
<s> Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
<s> I'm just going to get some ice.
<s> That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
<s> Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
<s> I met one of them.
<s> Yes.
<s> The Florida job?
<s> - you got to be blonde -
<s> - and you got to be girls.
<s> Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
<s> Bull fiddle.
<s> Why?
<s> Goodbye?
<s> Who?
<s> Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
<s> What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
<s> You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
<s> You got to be under twenty-five -
<s> No - funerals.
<s> There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
<s> Have you ever been with a male band?
<s> I'll say.
<s> I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
<s> You're entitled.
<s> Why?
<s> They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
<s> Tonight?
<s> I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
<s> Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
<s> I am?
<s> Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
<s> I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
<s> They just sort of leave me cold.
<s> Nothing at all?
<s> Thanks just the same.
<s> I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Me?
<s> But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
<s> I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
<s> How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
<s> Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
<s> Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
<s> Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
<s> Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
<s> Spats Colombo.
<s> Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
<s> Are you sure youre okay?
<s> So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
<s> Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, hello.
<s> Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
<s> I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
<s> When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
<s> Really?  Dont get too attached.
<s> Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
<s> Love.
<s> He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
<s> Why?
<s> On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
<s> Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
<s> My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
<s> Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
<s> Show me.
<s> We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
<s> Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
<s> No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
<s> Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
<s> Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
<s> Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
<s> Hi.
<s> Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
<s> Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
<s> Of course, dont be silly.
<s> Hard.
<s> What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
<s> You don't live around here, do you?
<s> No, Miss Johnson...
<s> You would do that, wouldn't you?
<s> Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
<s> Here, put my jacket over you.
<s> You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
<s> Yes, sir...
<s> And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
<s> I don't look like no possum!
<s> Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
<s> Same as we -- they pray.
<s> He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
<s> No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
<s> Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
<s> Yes, mam...
<s> How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
<s> But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
<s> It's the heat.
<s> Come in, children.
<s> Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
<s> Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
<s> At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
<s> I brought these walnuts to trade.
<s> Tired.
<s> I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
<s> Little chilly.
<s> Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
<s> I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
<s> Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
<s> You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
<s> Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
<s> Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
<s> The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
<s> Doggy.
<s> -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
<s> We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
<s> What?
<s> Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
<s> I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
<s> More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
<s> I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
<s> No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
<s> What Cartman?!
<s> Okay.    Not.
<s> Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
<s> I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
<s> I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
<s> Hey, Chef.
<s> It's... It's not good children.
<s> Oh no, it's that kid.
<s> This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
<s> Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
<s> Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
<s> Kay.
<s> She's not my girlfriend, dude!
<s> You bastards!!
<s> I don't know, dude.
<s> I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
<s> What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
<s> Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
<s> Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
<s> What is 'fisting'?
<s> We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
<s> No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
<s> Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
<s> Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
<s> I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
<s> You did? Just now?
<s> Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
<s> I know.
<s> <b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
<s> No! It can't be!
<s> Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
<s> Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
<s> God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
<s> You didn't?
<s> It can't be.
<s> So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
<s> You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
<s> They are awaiting further information.
<s> That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
<s> Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
<s> Taylor, you surprise me.
<s> Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
<s> That's me.
<s> I know, I know.
<s> The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
<s> Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
<s> Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
<s> Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
<s> I don't know.
<s> With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
<s> You're right.
<s> Even if we do, it might be too late.
<s> Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
<s> Ready as I'll ever be.
<s> One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
<s> Yeah?
<s> Sure.
<s> Try not to think about it.
<s> I don't know.  Wave to them!
<s> Is there anything I can help you with?
<s> There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
<s> Homesick?  It's only been two days!
<s> Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
<s> Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
<s> Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
<s> No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
<s> Lemme see your ball.
<s> Are you guys bruddas?
<s> La da da dalala...
<s> gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
<s> Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
<s> brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
<s> I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
<s> That game was before you was born.
<s> You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
<s> I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
<s> kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
<s> Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
<s> Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
<s> What's it look like to you?
<s> I'm your blood.
<s> See ya 'round Maynard.
<s> I found dad.
<s> SHEILA!
<s> Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
<s> It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
<s> He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
<s> Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
<s> That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
<s> Yippy!
<s> Coming right up.
<s> When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
<s> It's a vicious cycle.
<s> No, not at all.
<s> The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
<s> I'd rather you didn't.
<s> Not while I'm in training.
<s> No. Do You?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Sheila, please.
<s> Really? I kinda like it.
<s> It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
<s> So why do you stay?
<s> You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
<s> I feel sick.
<s> At least I'll die smiling.
<s> I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
<s> I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
<s> Please, Dr. Levine.
<s> I can't...
<s> I said back away.
<s> Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
<s> Two and a half days?
<s> Yeah.  I heard you.
<s> What if it attacks?
<s> High Voltage?
<s> He's right beneath us.
<s> That's our reserve air.
<s> Now!
<s> Pull it, damn it!
<s> What team?
<s> Nothing else.
<s> Press?  No, I haven't.
<s> Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
<s> As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
<s> -- Wait a second --
<s> But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
<s> I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
<s> The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
<s> Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
<s> Jerry?
<s> Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
<s> Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
<s> Well, where the fuck is he?
<s> Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
<s> So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
<s> A break for what?
<s> Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
<s> Ladies and Gentlemen...
<s> We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
<s> She's not gonna know.
<s> The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
<s> What is it?
<s> To what?
<s> Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
<s> Underwater?
<s> What -- are you threatening me?
<s> Yeah.  Drowning.
<s> Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
<s> What?
<s> She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
<s> You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
<s> It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
<s> Beth --
<s> In case you die, too?
<s> You don't trust me?
<s> I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
<s> My air isn't... I'm coming back.
<s> What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
<s> What?
<s> It's a soporific.
<s> How fast does it take effect?
<s> What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
<s> What do you mean, different?
<s> Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
<s> No, he can't.
<s> But I have to, Norman.
<s> From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
<s> Leave me alone, Norman.
<s> C'mon --
<s> What?
<s> Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
<s> A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
<s> Another attack?
<s> Which one?  Let me get the list out.
<s> A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
<s> Did I?
<s> When I woke up, nobody was here.
<s> But why would she -- ?
<s> Help me lift her.
<s> Shut up and open the door.
<s> Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
<s> Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
<s> We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
<s> You mean forget?
<s> To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
<s> You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
<s> Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
<s> Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
<s> Think about it.
<s> Meaning?
<s> What was that, sir?
<s> What report?
<s> Who's everyone?
<s> Geologists?  At a plane crash?
<s> Please, Ted.
<s> Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
<s> Not that I know of.  Why?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> This isn't a game, you know.
<s> ... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
<s> I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
<s> I know that.
<s> But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
<s> Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
<s> Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
<s> Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
<s> Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
<s> You look great!  The uniform and everything!
<s> But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
<s> At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
<s> What's that?
<s> Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
<s> Not if this tunnel deadends.
<s> No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
<s> Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
<s> Come back here... Where are you going?
<s> I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
<s> Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
<s> I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
<s> You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
<s> I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
<s> Are you there, sir?  We're going...
<s> We're the old men, Ace.
<s> Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
<s> Yes, sir !
<s> You got it bad.
<s> Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
<s> If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
<s> Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
<s> I'm getting better.
<s> Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
<s> You're upset, that's alright.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
<s> Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
<s> Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
<s> I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
<s> Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
<s> What happened to your eye ?
<s> I like it. It's kinda...you.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
<s> That's it, we're empty ma'am !
<s> No thanks, Diz.
<s> You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
<s> A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
<s> Teenagers !
<s> Looks like rain.
<s> A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
<s> Oh, is that how it is ?
<s> Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
<s> Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
<s> Good luck. It's not there anymore.
<s> Sir, yes it is, sir.
<s> Here in Buenos Aires.
<s> Aw, don't get mushy.
<s> Yeah, that's right.
<s> Move out.
<s> Not a problem.
<s> Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
<s> What's going on, Diz ?
<s> That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
<s> Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
<s> <U>Answer</U>!
<s> That is how V'ger will survive.
<s> Departure angle.
<s> Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
<s> I'm aware of that, sir.
<s> This served the purpose.
<s> It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
<s> You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
<s> Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
<s> Our Exec and Science Officer...
<s> Twelve seconds...!
<s> Opinion, Mister. Spock?
<s> He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
<s> Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
<s> Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
<s> Any reply from them?
<s> Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
<s> The point... 
<s> ... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
<s> Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
<s> Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
<s> Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
<s> Tractor beam remains constant...
<s> Annie...got an umbrella...?
<s> You bet your life.
<s> Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
<s> I need a typewritter.
<s> Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
<s> It's in your play.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes...
<s> Everyday things...yes.
<s> It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<s> You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
<s> <u>Yes</u>...
<s> Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
<s> Better idea...
<s> Oh, God...
<s> I used to go out with a politician.
<s> Sure did.
<s> ...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
<s> That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
<s> ...take <u>any</u> two people...
<s> Going home.
<s> No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
<s> You'd do the newspaper right here.
<s> Not without a rolltop desk.
<s> Happen to know where there's one for sale.
<s> Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
<s> ...you think that's right...
<s> Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
<s> Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
<s> Why, you <u>whore</u>!
<s> We'll work it out...
<s> Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
<s> And I need a drink.
<s> Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
<s> I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
<s> ...they run on water.
<s> On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
<s> This horse is booked.
<s> Sure, what have you got?
<s> You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
<s> And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
<s> How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
<s> Well.  What seems to be the...?
<s> I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
<s> There's other things to be learned.
<s> The Mayor's outside.
<s> Well, what's the beef?
<s> Yes.
<s> What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
<s> I'm only trying to...

<s> <u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
<s> I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
<s> You were in the car with Bob?
<s> ...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
<s> Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
<s> Yes.
<s> I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
<s> ...she keeps her back to the camera...?
<s> I'm out.
<s> The girl was in the car.
<s> I can write it.  I can't type it.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
<s> I left that for you.
<s> Find the money.
<s> We don't have the money.

<s> You tell me what to do, I'll do it.

<s> I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
<s> Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
<s> Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
<s> That will never happen.
<s> I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
<s> Sex.  Of course.
<s> I live.  In the same country.
<s> I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
<s> But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
<s> I'll be there for you.
<s> Like a big sister.
<s> ...I'm not deaf, y'know.
<s> I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
<s> I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
<s> He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
<s> Thank God for that!
<s> That doesn't bother me.
<s> Suits me <u>fine</u>!
<s> There you are!
<s> Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
<s> No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
<s> &quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
<s> I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
<s> Mom...?
<s> Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
<s> But you can still see him.
<s> Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
<s> Sooner than later.  You really need to.
<s> But you're not <u>done</u>!
<s> We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
<s> You think I didn't get that?
<s> Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
<s> We're not discussing your age.
<s> They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
<s> It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
<s> I'm worried.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
<s> To make it easier for them or you?
<s> WE are over.
<s> It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
<s> Can I please have a cup of coffee?
<s> Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
<s> I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
<s> You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
<s> What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
<s> You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
<s> Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
<s> Beats me.  Ask your mom.
<s> You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.

<s> I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'

<s> I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
<s> So I'll have to order in?
<s> But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
<s> Nobody's telling them to hate you --
<s> It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
<s> I think so...What do you think?
<s> Rache, it may take time.
<s> Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
<s> I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
<s> You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
<s> What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
<s> By way of saying you were unhappy.
<s> Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
<s> Like what?
<s> Thanks, Scoob.
<s> He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
<s> Great to be here.
<s> Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm always working.
<s> No.
<s> My baby.
<s> Jesus was not bad.
<s> I am sure.
<s> For rape and murder.
<s> It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
<s> What?
<s> Got a lot of homework?
<s> You started filling out your college applications yet?
<s> Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
<s> Is everything OK?
<s> How was the class?
<s> I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
<s> Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
<s> Tired of this shit...
<s> No.
<s> Say, 'Nigger.'
<s> 'Fuck me hard!'
<s> Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
<s> All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
<s> Toby Oxman.
<s> Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Maybe she has caller ID.
<s> No, I don't think so...
<s> You should be.
<s> Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
<s> Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
<s> He did?
<s> Well, I-I hope that--that--
<s> Why? Are we going dancing?
<s> What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
<s> If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
<s> I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
<s> No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I don't want any...
<s> She's as good as gone...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What the hell is it, anyhow?
<s> What!
<s> We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
<s> Richter-we got a problem!
<s> You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
<s> Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
<s> Did you get that, Kulnick?
<s> I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
<s> Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
<s> Oh, yes, that's right.
<s> Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
<s> I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
<s> Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
<s> Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
<s> Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
<s> General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
<s> I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
<s> Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
<s> Yes?
<s> That certainly would be a problem, sir.
<s> Do you recognize my voice?
<s> I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
<s> Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
<s> But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
<s> I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
<s> Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
<s> Plan-R????
<s> That's right, Major.
<s> Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
<s> If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
<s> Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
<s> Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
<s> Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
<s> Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
<s> Peace on earth.
<s> I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
<s> Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
<s> Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
<s> The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
<s> Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
<s> We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
<s> They're moving apart.
<s> Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
<s> Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
<s> Some kind of signaling.
<s> Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
<s> Check, ten thousand air burst.
<s> Hell, he looks dead.
<s> Listen, give me a shot quick!
<s> Why should they call us back?
<s> But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
<s> You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
<s> Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
<s> But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
<s> But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
<s> Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
<s> Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
<s> Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
<s> It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> Was it okay?
<s> Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
<s> Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
<s> No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
<s> And your mom.
<s> What?
<s> No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
<s> The dude wants it.
<s> Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
<s> What, they're looking for her?
<s> Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
<s> She's dead.
<s> Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
<s> Come on.
<s> You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
<s> Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
<s> I will.
<s> You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
<s> We're your customers. We're not complaining.
<s> Hey, thanks, man.
<s> You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
<s> "Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
<s> A reel?
<s> What'd he get you?
<s> Military marching bands.
<s> Really?
<s> I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
<s> We were?
<s> Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
<s> Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
<s> He causes problems. He was here earlier.
<s> Who were you talking to?
<s> Sooze wants to see him.
<s> No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
<s> Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
<s> Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
<s> I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
<s> He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
<s> That, that's Indian?
<s> Look, your trespassing.
<s> Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
<s> I don't know. I think she's breathing.
<s> No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
<s> Hey!
<s> Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
<s> And?
<s> Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
<s> You do.
<s> No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
<s> Shit, Jeff!
<s> Wait. What, what are you saying?
<s> Oh, no, no, no.
<s> Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
<s> Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
<s> You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
<s> It's stupid.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> It's pretty exciting.
<s> Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
<s> New York, huh?
<s> You done?
<s> Yep.
<s> I don't know. I say what I mean.
<s> Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
<s> Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
<s> Oh, my god!
<s> Really? What else does your mother say?
<s> Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
<s> About what?
<s> Don't do that.
<s> Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
<s> Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
<s> Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
<s> No car.
<s> You know the fuck not.
<s> Don't swear it's impolite.
<s> It's twins!!
<s> Wayne Gretzky.
<s> My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
<s> Bye.
<s> Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
<s> Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
<s> Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
<s> Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
<s> No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
<s> Well, I want to know what happened --
<s> Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
<s> For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
<s> Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
<s> Bullets.
<s> Or, I could get my own horse...
<s> Kansas?
<s> Oh yeah, you caught us...
<s> Thanks!  That'd be great.
<s> Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
<s> Maybe we can make a deal.
<s> Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
<s> My what?
<s> Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
<s> So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
<s> Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
<s> Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
<s> I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
<s> Action! The scene starts.
<s> Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
<s> Nothing for Ladd?
<s> I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
<s> I just think pictures should say a little something.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
<s> I tell you this is half sold.
<s> Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
<s> It will?
<s> I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
<s> Second generation, huh?
<s> You did.
<s> And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
<s> I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
<s> Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
<s> It is not.  Get out.
<s> Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
<s> Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
<s> Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> This is fascinating.
<s> Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
<s> There's something wrong with your car, you said.
<s> You can stay here.
<s> Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
<s> Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
<s> It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
<s> I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
<s> Just follow me.
<s> There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
<s> Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
<s> Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
<s> Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
<s> I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
<s> Maybe deMille is shooting.
<s> I think I'll read a little.
<s> Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
<s> I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
<s> Naturally.  I brought them myself.
<s> Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
<s> The doctor suggested it.
<s> I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
<s> You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
<s> It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
<s> You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
<s> Yes.  Madame.
<s> Who?
<s> The cameras have arrived, Madame.
<s> The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
<s> Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
<s> She didn't take it from you, did she?
<s> You love me?
<s> Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
<s> Just like that?
<s> Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
<s> She has hostages.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> What an adorable hat.
<s> It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
<s> I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
<s> But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
<s> She's a beast.
<s> It doesn't seem right.
<s> Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
<s> He's nice.
<s> I'd love to.
<s> You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
<s> I have to talk to you.
<s> Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
<s> It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
<s> Not yet.
<s> It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
<s> It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
<s> Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
<s> What? Palace? Hardly.
<s> If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
<s> Why?
<s> You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
<s> Better than when I was a child.
<s> Don't stop. Keep moving.
<s> Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
<s> Brad.
<s> Clark.
<s> But Lana, you could --
<s> Oh. You're going away.
<s> We get together sometimes.
<s> Mmmmm . . .
<s> Yeah.
<s> Kitchen. . . Technician
<s> Say who?
<s> Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
<s> 'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
<s> Black or regular?
<s> I did. isn't it neat-o?
<s> What are you talking about, fella?
<s> Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
<s> Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
<s> They ain't got captains?
<s> I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
<s> You designed it?
<s> What will it do?
<s> It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
<s> Join the party, genius! Come on up!
<s> We back in Metropolis?
<s> But the bridge...
<s> Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
<s> Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
<s> Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
<s> How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
<s> My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
<s> Don't cry, Bubba.
<s> How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
<s> Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
<s> Do I detect a note of jealousy?
<s> Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
<s> Really?
<s> No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
<s> Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
<s> Maybe you wanted to.
<s> Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
<s> Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
<s> Everything on it.
<s> The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
<s> Good. My heart can't take it.
<s> Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
<s> Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
<s> Sensible enough.
<s> North.
<s> The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
<s> I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
<s> Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
<s> Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
<s> Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
<s> You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
<s> Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
<s> I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
<s> Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
<s> Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
<s> Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
<s> Our other dinner guest.
<s> My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
<s> This wasn't in the plan.
<s> For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
<s> Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
<s> I've been on the job.
<s> It was hot, yes.
<s> No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
<s> I know.
<s> Well!
<s> Actually, she's silver-haired.
<s> What the  --  !
<s> Oh.
<s> Don't you ever give up?
<s> Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
<s> Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
<s> You're not the only one.
<s> He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
<s> My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
<s> You think he's for real?
<s> Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
<s> Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
<s> Bingo!
<s> I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
<s> You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
<s> You?! How about me?
<s> There was a recipe on the back  --
<s> Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
<s> What other one?
<s> This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
<s> Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
<s> All of us.
<s> Folks'll ask question.
<s> He'll be weightless.
<s> It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
<s> Okay, but...why?  No offense.
<s> He is. Usually.
<s> Oh, God! I'm going to die!
<s> Right on the first guess.
<s> There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Very much.
<s> Yessir. Just what you wanted.
<s> I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
<s> I...uh...check.
<s> Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
<s> I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
<s> For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
<s> Are you still in touch?
<s> Which one?
<s> Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
<s> I will.
<s> Mister, I don't want to know your name.
<s> No you don't.
<s> Not unless you can raise the dead.
<s> You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
<s> Was it good?
<s> Can't you make it later?
<s> Why?
<s> You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
<s> Berry-picking.
<s> That would complicate things.
<s> I did.
<s> Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
<s> Why would he be frightened?
<s> I didn't say that.
<s> I'll just strap it on the roof.
<s> Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
<s> A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
<s> I'll...take it straight.
<s> No.  What's this lawyer business?
<s> What's a ditty again?
<s> Oh.
<s> Okay.
<s> What, Mason?
<s> The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
<s> I object to that form of question. Note that.
<s> Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
<s> Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
<s> That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
<s> I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
<s> Don't you want to hear?
<s> Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
<s> I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
<s> What is it?
<s> No.
<s> It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> About eight-thirty in the morning.
<s> And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
<s> Dolores was driving too fast.
<s> Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
<s> Seventy-two miles an hour.
<s> No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
<s> Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
<s> Oh.  I better get some spackle.
<s> You and Mom have a lawyer?
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> But Charlene...
<s> How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
<s> It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
<s> Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
<s> The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
<s> I doubt that it matters any more.
<s> Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
<s> Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
<s> Hurry back.
<s> I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
<s> No, I wouldn't...
<s> Why, has he bothered you before?
<s> No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
<s> Did Sidney tell you about it?
<s> I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
<s> J.J., Steve isn't...
<s> Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
<s> Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
<s> Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
<s> You print them, don't you?
<s> Not "we", Sidney, you!
<s> Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
<s> A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
<s> But not for anything I did today...
<s> J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
<s> Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
<s> - He's got them on him.
<s> I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
<s> Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
<s> Hello.
<s> Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
<s> What kind of an act is this?
<s> Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
<s> Nothing I didn't think of you before.
<s> Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
<s> I know you do, Sidney.
<s> Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
<s> Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
<s> Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
<s> Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
<s> Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
<s> Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
<s> I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
<s> Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
<s> Why did you call me?
<s> But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
<s> Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
<s> NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
<s> In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
<s> Let me try mine.
<s> Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
<s> Why?
<s> A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
<s> No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
<s> No problemo.
<s> It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
<s> No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
<s> Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
<s> You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
<s> She intends to change the future somehow.
<s> Drive faster.
<s> Gimme that Phillips right there.
<s> No!  Don't kill him!
<s> Alright, it!  We need it!
<s> I love you, John.  I always have.
<s> Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
<s> Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
<s> There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
<s> Open the goddamn door!
<s> Why him?
<s> Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
<s> I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
<s> And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
<s> For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
<s> Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
<s> Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
<s> Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
<s> Not yet.
<s> There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
<s> What museum?
<s> I have a duty.
<s> Do you know where the Adagio begins?
<s> I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
<s> It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
<s> I was warned.
<s> The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
<s> Tell me about von der Null.
<s> You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
<s> What?
<s> No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
<s> Of course I know what that is.
<s> That's what I asked.
<s> The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
<s> Show you?
<s> Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
<s> Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
<s> Yeah?
<s> But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
<s> Jeez, and I never heard of him.
<s> Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
<s> Come to the office, please.
<s> You're late.
<s> The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
<s> Great.
<s> I thought you did.
<s> Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
<s> Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
<s> Freezing.
<s> What's that?
<s> That's the way it was told to me.
<s> You must have had a fun child-
<s> I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
<s> I want it to be over for you.
<s> If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
<s> Kyle...
<s> Then how are you supposed to get back?
<s> I just called.
<s> The stock will turn.
<s> Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
<s> You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
<s> I don't think he's breathing.
<s> He's turning blue!
<s> What <u>is</u> your problem?
<s> You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
<s> Never mind.
<s> Why... ?
<s> Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
<s> Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
<s> Wha... ?
<s> Get out.
<s> It might be best if we didn't talk.
<s> ... what... ?
<s> That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
<s> Studied acting, I assume?
<s> Single?
<s> They'll be wanting it back.
<s> No.
<s> Fun?
<s> This isn't an escort service?
<s> I'm going to call.
<s> Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
<s> You're part of it...
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I hope.
<s> No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
<s> Humor me with specifics.
<s> Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
<s> You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
<s> It was a different floor then...
<s> First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
<s> Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
<s> His behavior... ?
<s> A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
<s> A Mister... Seymour Butts.
<s> Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
<s> Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<s> Nothing else?
<s> Sam...  Thank you.
<s> You warm my heart.
<s> What?
<s> Uh... Nell Vance...
<s> It's somebody's idea of a joke.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You could have.
<s> You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
<s> No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
<s> Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
<s> But there's a sad catch to the story.
<s> Why?
<s> It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
<s> And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
<s> It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
<s> Test it.
<s> Nell, what do we do?
<s> Who?
<s> I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
<s> I don't know what to think anymore.
<s> I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
<s> Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
<s> Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
<s> I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
<s> It's not a knock.
<s> It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
<s> Okay.
<s> This is un-fucking professional.
<s> What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
<s> We'll find him.
<s> There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
<s> Let him break - he likes to break.
<s> I wouldn't talk.
<s> Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
<s> It was better than a telegram.
<s> Terry Valentine.
<s> No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
<s> Not me, man.
<s> And that's where you met Jenny.
<s> Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
<s> Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
<s> You goin' back inside?
<s> That would be too easy.
<s> He's gotta know why.
<s> Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No, but I know what he means.
<s> I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
<s> Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
<s> Sounds like Beverly Hills.
<s> If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
<s> Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
<s> Depends, don' it.
<s> Hey?
<s> Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
<s> I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
<s> I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
<s> Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
<s> He had urgent business in the north.
<s> Sorry.  Wasn't me.
<s> Unless I'm not who I think I am.
<s> Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
<s> But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
<s> Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
<s> Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
<s> While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
<s> -- You know his name is Frank.
<s> You know I don't live with him.
<s> Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
<s> The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
<s> It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
<s> I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
<s> Ah... it's nothing.
<s> Well? How'd she do?
<s> Did she make mistakes?
<s> I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
<s> Uh--
<s> That right.
<s> Maybe.
<s> It's OK.
<s> How's business, Dave?
<s> Specialty store down in Sacramento.
<s> Well, you know what that would do to me.
<s> ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
<s> So you paid the guy?
<s> Honey?
<s> Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
<s> You don't have to--
<s> Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
<s> Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
<s> ...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
<s> Sure you don't need one?
<s> OK. Boy. Jesus!
<s> Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
<s> He a good man?
<s> Whuddya mean?
<s> Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
<s> ...Nah.
<s> What'd he say?
<s> Not an owner.
<s> Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
<s> If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
<s> Do they have to wear uniforms?
<s> Hurry up!
<s> To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
<s> Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
<s> You said the system couldn't fail!
<s> It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
<s> Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
<s> What's left of it.
<s> Where's the head?
<s> How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
<s> If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
<s> Correct.
<s> This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
<s> We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
<s> Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
<s> The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
<s> Pardon my French, but bull shit.
<s> The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
<s> What is it?
<s> All right everybody, hold up!
<s> Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
<s> Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
<s> You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
<s> I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
<s> That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
<s> Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
<s> We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
<s> They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> Footsteps!
<s> Big as a house.
<s> Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
<s> You're color blind.
<s> Quiet.
<s> Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
<s> It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
<s> Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
<s> Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
<s> How about lunch?
<s> And John?
<s> You were afraid of him, weren't you?
<s> A monster?
<s> What happened?
<s> Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
<s> You were behind me?  Running after me?
<s> I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
<s> Gone.
<s> It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
<s> No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
<s> What?
<s> You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
<s> Why wouldn't I?
<s> That's right.
<s> It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
<s> He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
<s> He gave it back to his father.
<s> We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
<s> --a dead one at that.
<s> As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
<s> Certainly a nomination.
<s> All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
<s> It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
<s> That's right.  Lauren.
<s> Yeah?  Outta what?
<s> --Truman, what are you doing here?
<s> Sorry, I'm way behind.
<s> This is where it started.
<s> It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
<s> Gee, that's great.
<s> I've been thinking--
<s> I still want to look over a couple of things.
<s> Oh, my God!
<s> I won't be here Sunday.
<s> What?!
<s> --What the hell are you talking about?!
<s> You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
<s> Do something...
<s> I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
<s> It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
<s> The whole area's being evacuated.
<s> There's no one here.
<s> You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
<s> Working with?
<s> Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
<s> I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
<s> Do you?
<s> Not according to the men in blue.
<s> How?
<s> When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
<s> Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
<s> I told you -- he and I were old friends --
<s> The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
<s> -- Mulder! Get in the car!
<s> They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
<s> I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
<s> I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
<s> Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
<s> No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
<s> It looks pretty green for this climate.
<s> I don't know, Mulder.
<s> This is great. This is fitting.
<s> Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
<s> Very weird.
<s> Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
<s> Just like that --
<s> I don't have his number.
<s> I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
<s> Yes.
<s> About the conspiracy?
<s> That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
<s> As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
<s> Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
<s> The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
<s> No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
<s> You need not kill a man to destroy him.
<s> Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
<s> Lucien Baines?
<s> If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
<s> Yes mother.
<s> No.  No.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I don't need them anymore...
<s> Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
<s> Okay, okay...
<s> Like hell "wait."
<s> All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
<s> I got it.
<s> Mocky-Lock.
<s> I need you to find something in the basement...
<s> That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
<s> Completely unaware.
<s> Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
<s> Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
<s> She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
<s> Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
<s> Do you understand German?
<s> I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
<s> He has a little dog.
<s> The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
<s> In German?
<s> Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
<s> It's just what he used to say.
<s> If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
<s> Why?
<s> Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
<s> Oh, the usual things...
<s> From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
<s> No.
<s> That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
<s> Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
<s> No, not yet.
<s> Fellow called Lime.
<s> Martins.
<s> Yes.
<s> Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
<s> What?
<s> Well, you could say that murder was part...
<s> I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
<s> We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
<s> Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
<s> She's right. It's none of my business.
<s> I said you win.
<s> This way, miss.
<s> Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
<s> Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
<s> I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
<s> What is it, Sergeant?
<s> Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
<s> It's good to see you, Holly.
<s> She's been arrested.
<s> You can help her.
<s> And - Anna...
<s> You wouldn't do anything.
<s> What do you want?
<s> At the end of every chapter --
<s> English?
<s> Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
<s> Must be some mistake.
<s> Yes, yes, I remember you.
<s> Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
<s> With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
<s> I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
<s> Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
<s> So how many miles do you think it is?
<s> What!
<s> Fuck off.
<s> You can swim?
<s> Hi there. Here, take a look.
<s> So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
<s> We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
<s> The Zionists aren't Nazis.
<s> What??
<s> Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
<s> I have a job.
<s> Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
<s> Disease? What disease?
<s> At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
<s> Killing himself.
<s> Yes, I am. Basically I am.
<s> You can't.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
<s> What assholes.
<s> Don't curse in front of it.
<s> Do they?
<s> Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
<s> Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
<s> Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
<s> What'd you say?
<s> I'm stealing it.
<s> No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
<s> In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
<s> Notice? Like what...?
<s> Why?
<s> A forty-five.
<s> I can't say that.
<s> Yes!
<s> I was going to ask you the same thing.
<s> Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
<s> You mean Ilio Manzetti?
<s> Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
<s> Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
<s> It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
<s> JTS...?
<s> What are you trying to say?
<s> "Do chickens give milk?"
<s> They're not that Jewish.
<s> No.
<s> Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
<s> Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
<s> Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
<s> ... So am I.
<s> Have you known him long?
<s> Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> You know what I'm talking about.
<s> The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
<s> "That"!  This is not a "that"...
<s> The rules are the rules.
<s> For others, yes... For you, who knows?
<s> Fine!
<s> Enzo...
<s> No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
<s> What room have you got?
<s> Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
<s> Everything about what?
<s> The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
<s> No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
<s> Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
<s> ... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
<s> Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
<s> I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
<s> ... Okay.  I'll try.
<s> I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
<s> I did?
<s> ... Not at all.
<s> ... Nothing.
<s> That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
<s> No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
<s> Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
<s> No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
<s> No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
<s> Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
<s> The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
<s> ... Sally?
<s> Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
<s> Haven't you been listening?
<s> No.  I'm just depressed.
<s> Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
<s> Of course, that's what they're for.
<s> Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
<s> Yes... It's magic.
<s> Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
<s> I'll have to talk to the driver.
<s> How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
<s> Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
<s> It's Esther. Santa's got her.
<s> I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
<s> It's Esther.
<s> Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
<s> Yeah, no kidding.
<s> I said, yeah, about once a week!
<s> Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
<s> Mordechai!
<s> I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
<s> Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
<s> No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
<s> Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
<s> Happy Hanukkah Morty.
<s> She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
<s> Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
<s> If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
<s> Good looking?
<s> I sleep it off.
<s> Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
<s> But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
<s> Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
<s> Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
<s> You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
<s> No. I'm quite sure.
<s> That's right, of course.
<s> Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
<s> It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
<s> No.
<s> I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
<s> To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
<s> There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
<s> Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
<s> I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
<s> Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
<s> The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
<s> Don't be soft.
<s> Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
<s> You're positive of that, aren't you?
<s> We will 
<s> Aint nobody out there, Mister.
<s> Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
<s> You a tourist?
<s> I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
<s> I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
<s> And that is the last time any...
<s> Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
<s> I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
<s> Disney! How inter...
<s> What... What are you talking about?
<s> You drive a hard bargain.
<s> Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
<s> The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
<s> W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
<s> The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
<s> Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
<s> Sorry?
<s> I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
<s> It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
<s> Leon hung himself.
<s> If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
<s> Here we go again.
<s> I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
<s> On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
<s> You wouldnt understand.
<s> Im fine standing, thank you.
<s> No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
<s> How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
<s> Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
<s> So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
<s> Were both thinking the same thing, right?
<s> Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
<s> What about your friendly cop?
<s> Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
<s> If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
<s> Have we done business before?
<s> What sort have you got?
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> I see. How much?
<s> Yeah... The Diplomat.
<s> I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
<s> Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...
<s> La what?
<s> That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
<s> Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
<s> What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
<s> Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
<s> I hope its not too significant.
<s> Recommended?
<s> Jah...
<s> Is my money in there?
<s> I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.
<s> Dying without ever reaching the top...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
<s> Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
<s> Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
<s> Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
<s> A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
<s> Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
<s> Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
<s> It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
<s> Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
<s> I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
<s> Majesty, I can't...
<s> So... pretend it's not a game.
<s> Tremoille... don't.  Please...
<s> Do you think I could have some water?
<s> Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
<s> Jeanne, no...
<s> You make it sound so simple...
<s> Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
<s> Tell me...
<s> You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
<s> To marry you.
<s> But... why... what's the point?
<s> I want to stay with you...
<s> I -- I don't understand...
<s> I'm staying, Jean.
<s> I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
<s> I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
<s> To avoid killing anyone.
<s> What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
<s> She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
<s> I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
<s> What about you?
<s> I will hear you... but not now, not here.
<s> Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
<s> I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
<s> I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
<s> You really think she's been sent... by God?
<s> I'm... I'm not the king...
<s> Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
<s> Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
<s> Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
<s> ... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
<s> If there was, I didn't see it...
<s> I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
<s> Yes... they were.
<s> We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
<s> Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
<s> Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
<s> That'll put fire in my soldiers!
<s> Damn right!
<s> Me too...
<s> Yes.  We can pray.
<s> So... bring up the reinforcements!
<s> Yes, but...
<s> That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
<s> Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
<s> Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
<s> God knows, but it was a bad idea!
<s> Don't swear...
<s> I'd sooner die than use magic!
<s> What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
<s> I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
<s> I might ask you the same question.
<s> How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
<s> What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
<s> Really?
<s> No...
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> Whose were they?
<s> Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Jeanne, be patient.
<s> I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
<s> Dead.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
<s> What, I'm working, what?
<s> It costs.
<s> Do they?
<s> That makes a change.
<s> No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
<s> Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
<s> Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
<s> You'll be deported.
<s> 'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
<s> Yes, that's why I brought it.
<s> You're amazing, Jehuda.
<s> Toilets?
<s> I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
<s> I was listening, Kitten.
<s> You made contact?
<s> It will be very dramatic.
<s> Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
<s> No, no bible readers.
<s> No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
<s> Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
<s> I don't want to learn.
<s> It was more to your wife that I gave it.
<s> The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
<s> She says, throw the piano overboard.
<s> You've missed this bit.
<s> Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
<s> No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
<s> You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
<s> No.
<s> Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
<s> Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
<s> Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
<s> They workin' for anybody?
<s> Hackers.
<s> What do ya want the others to get?
<s> What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
<s> You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
<s> Then you'll do it?
<s> Let him wait.
<s> No, not a thing.
<s> Did he hold you up on anything?
<s> He'll show.
<s> It was too noisy.
<s> All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
<s> A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
<s> Then why you doin' it?
<s> Not enough to cover a bet that big.
<s> Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
<s> Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
<s> Where's June today?
<s> Where you goin'?
<s> How ya doin', Jimmy.
<s> He hired a dame to take it from ya.
<s> You got a system, Carver?
<s> Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
<s> All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
<s> If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
<s> With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
<s> I don't know.  He took it hard.
<s> Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
<s> Come on, gimme a break.
<s> No.
<s> He was?
<s> Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
<s> Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
<s> Oh, Andy, Andy!
<s> Give it to me.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
<s> There!
<s> Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
<s> Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
<s> tried him once -
<s> No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
<s> What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
<s> Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
<s> Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
<s> That's the truth.
<s> You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
<s> And he still wants to marry me!
<s> I'm very interested in that body.
<s> Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
<s> He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
<s> She could tell you where father is.
<s> I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
<s> Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
<s> What'd he think it was to you?
<s> I'm asking you.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
<s> Nunheim!
<s> Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
<s> Rosebreen.
<s> I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
<s> Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
<s> You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
<s> Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
<s> Oh, then you did hear from him?
<s> Why yes.
<s> That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
<s> Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
<s> I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
<s> What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
<s> Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
<s> I thought you said you weren't going there.
<s> This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
<s> Don't you remember....
<s> What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
<s> supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
<s> You're going to return every cent of it!
<s> What did you do with the rest?
<s> I trust you.
<s> No.
<s> What'll I do if something comes up?
<s> I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
<s> I haven't been a detective for four years.
<s> Slim.
<s> He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
<s> Well, don't you?
<s> I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
<s> They'll want more than your word for that.
<s> Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
<s> Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
<s> That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
<s> She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
<s> Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
<s> Hello, baby.
<s> He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
<s> If you like 'em like that.
<s> Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
<s> Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
<s> You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
<s> All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
<s> Someone get a doctor.
<s> Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
<s> Who's that?
<s> I don't know.
<s> You talk as if I were Asta.
<s> Maybe I will.
<s> I don't believe he did it.
<s> Catch me letting you go alone!
<s> We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
<s> Goodbye, darling.
<s> Sure I will.
<s> I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
<s> No.  Nobody but you.
<s> I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
<s> Home!
<s> I'm fired.
<s> This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
<s> Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
<s> Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
<s> Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
<s> You just go when I say go.
<s> We can't just go off and--
<s> What do you figure it to be?
<s> I heard!
<s> What about the gold?
<s> It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
<s> Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
<s> Suppose I don't go for that?
<s> Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
<s> Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
<s> Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
<s> Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
<s> Roger that.
<s> Oh, that's fun.
<s> We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
<s> It's the only way.  We drive!
<s> I got that...sir.
<s> You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
<s> It's the treasure, that's what it is.
<s> Shut up and listen!
<s> What are they doing here?
<s> What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
<s> They can't shoot us in here.
<s> What does it look like I'm doing?
<s> We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
<s> Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
<s> It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
<s> Wes is dead!
<s> Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
<s> You still got a map on you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No!
<s> The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
<s> Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
<s> Probably.
<s> We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
<s> I don't know.  They killed Wes.
<s> What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
<s> A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
<s> Then I'm a rich man.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
<s> They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
<s> I thought it would be good to know.
<s> Now you need me.
<s> What!?
<s> The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
<s> Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
<s> It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
<s> A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
<s> Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
<s> Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
<s> Permant cortex bond.
<s> 4732...?
<s> He wants me to come to his quarters.
<s> That's not food.  Can't be food.
<s> It's 3+27 hundred
<s> We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
<s> No one can see us now we're alone.
<s> Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
<s> I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
<s> It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
<s> On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
<s> Where is LUH?
<s> Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
<s> You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
<s> What?
<s> Look!
<s> I don't care.
<s> I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
<s> No!....
<s> No?
<s> No......  She's dead THX........
<s> I'm only trying to help you.
<s> What do you want?
<s> You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
<s> Yes...
<s> -Where?
<s> We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
<s> Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
<s> Where...?
<s> Sounds like terrorist heaven.
<s> What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
<s> Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
<s> I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
<s> No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
<s> Where you guys at?
<s> That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
<s> Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
<s> Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
<s> T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
<s> Reilly! He's loaded!
<s> A ticking bomb...
<s> And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
<s> Look, it's important.
<s> Insurance?
<s> That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
<s> Yeah, just a nick ...
<s> What?
<s> You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
<s> My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
<s> That feeling won't last long.
<s> Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
<s> I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
<s> Report on the case so far.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> And it had diamonds in the back.
<s> Very well, Jacques.
<s> In a moment.
<s> erect in sweater, arms folded.
<s> So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
<s> Constantinople?
<s> I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
<s> <u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
<s> Umm.
<s> Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
<s> Nice suit.
<s> Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
<s> No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
<s> Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
<s> Um-hum ...
<s> Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
<s> No, not at all!
<s> And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
<s> Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
<s> <u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<s> Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
<s> Lily!
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
<s> Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
<s> The pleasure is mine, madame.
<s> In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
<s> Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
<s> No. What is it? Tell me.
<s> As you like. 
<s> And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
<s> Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
<s> Um-hum ...
<s> Good night.
<s> M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
<s> You would?
<s> I know all your tricks.
<s> What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
<s> And you expect me to believe that?
<s> I don't believe it!
<s> But it could have been glorious.
<s> Yes, Madame Colet?
<s> What is it, madame?
<s> I know!
<s> Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
<s> Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
<s> I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
<s> How much is your salary?
<s> Yes, my bag!
<s> Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
<s> Well, where is it?
<s> An hour, two at most.
<s> What? You have to get to a boat right away!
<s> And to you, Mr. Andrews.
<s> Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
<s> Lewis...
<s> It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
<s> Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
<s> So do I.
<s> There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
<s> Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
<s> I was tired.
<s> I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
<s> I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
<s> I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
<s> We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
<s> We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
<s> Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
<s> No.
<s> Could I speak to you in private?
<s> Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
<s> She had beautiful hands.
<s> I'm sorry. Really... I am.
<s> Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
<s> Sure. If you like.
<s> Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
<s> Sssshh. Come here.
<s> Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
<s> Au contraire, mon cher.
<s> I can't feel my body.
<s> You think she was really there?
<s> Would you like anything?
<s> Charmed, I'm sure.
<s> This is Miss Marsh.
<s> <U>Gladly</U>.
<s> Not at all.
<s> I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
<s> I'll say she is!
<s> I could stand some more--
<s> So you washed it off!
<s> But I'll have cocktails with you.
<s> For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
<s> Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
<s> A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
<s> You can live that down, can't you?
<s> Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
<s> Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
<s> Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
<s> I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
<s> Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
<s> No, sir?
<s> Change?
<s> Now you're talkin'!
<s> Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
<s> Partners, ain't we?
<s> <U>Me</U>!
<s> Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
<s> Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
<s> It's a pleasure.
<s> Much better--thank you--
<s> No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
<s> It's a bet--come on, Sally!
<s> You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
<s> No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
<s> I should say not.
<s> Sure.
<s> Sure.
<s> Send that.
<s> O.K.! Send that!
<s> Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
<s> She's in New York.
<s> Who won?
<s> <U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
<s> Are you happy?
<s> Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
<s> No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
<s> I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
<s> I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
<s> But not nice enough to marry--eh?
<s> I'll never love anybody else.
<s> Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
<s> But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
<s> What's he got that I haven't got?
<s> No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
<s> About twelve hundred.
<s> Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
<s> You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
<s> I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
<s> Hey--you! Where you going?
<s> Isn't that a daisy?
<s> Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
<s> Here it come: one-two-
<s> I was kidding about that.
<s> Say when.
<s> Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
<s> Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
<s> Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
<s> I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
<s> But Doc-
<s> Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
<s> Then what do I do?
<s> All right.  Then what?
<s> Not half as bad as I feel.
<s> Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
<s> Easy now... That mare's in season.
<s> You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
<s> The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
<s> Getting late.  We better get back.
<s> Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
<s> Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
<s> I think I'll just lie down awhile
<s> No really, I can stay a while.
<s> Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
<s> I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
<s> Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
<s> What're you talkin' about?
<s> I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
<s> Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
<s> I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
<s> Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
<s> Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
<s> Sure...
<s> Doc's just in no kinda shape.
<s> Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
<s> Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
<s> Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
<s> Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
<s> No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
<s> Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
<s> Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
<s> Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
<s> I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
<s> I can feel your pain.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
<s> Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
<s> Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
<s> That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
<s> I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Shhhhh...
<s> Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
<s> Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
<s> Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
<s> I see...
<s> If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
<s> I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
<s> Hey - the world is my office.
<s> Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
<s> Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
<s> Depends what number you write.
<s> I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
<s> This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
<s> I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
<s> No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
<s> He was my father's best friend!
<s> Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
<s> Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
<s> Captain Morton.
<s> Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
<s> Excellent.
<s> Get more men up there!
<s> No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
<s> ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
<s> One to seven: Deal the face cards.
<s> We got the same thing.
<s> I told her I would if she would give me time.
<s> My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
<s> Will you still get the money from your father?
<s> He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
<s> Like a veil has been lifted?
<s> Do you think you won?
<s> Babe Brother.
<s> This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
<s> You stay inside. I will see to them.
<s> You better come sit down. You are still sick.
<s> Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
<s> Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
<s> Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
<s> 'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
<s> You should go back and rest.
<s> He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
<s> Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
<s> Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
<s> I already have, my dear.
<s> Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
<s> I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
<s> If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
<s> I was just trying to make conversation.
<s> He is in his pigeon cage.
<s> Oh, yeah!
<s> Let's let Molly open one.
<s> I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
<s> I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
<s> No, you can't.
<s> That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
<s> That's why.  Sid.
<s> You mean that happy child?
<s> Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
<s> Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
<s> Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
<s> One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
<s> I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
<s> We've got to get out of here...NOW.
<s> Hold still, Buzz!
<s> Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
<s> What's with him?
<s> Everyone, it's Woody!
<s> Heh-heh.
<s> Oh no, Hannah!
<s> Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
<s> I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
<s> That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
<s> Nothing.
<s> You murdering dog!
<s> Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
<s> There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
<s> Yes SIR!
<s> Right here, Woody!
<s> See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
<s> I did like the music.
<s> She got away.
<s> Let me in.
<s> I finished it off.
<s> Storms?
<s> Juliet who?
<s> Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
<s> I can't find Manolo.
<s> Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
<s> I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
<s> Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
<s> What?
<s> Carl, that's insane.
<s> Barbara --
<s> Look, I'm as worried as you are --
<s> Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Just watching you.
<s> We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
<s> How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm third in my class.
<s> I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
<s> What is this, like freebase?
<s> Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
<s> Have you done your homework, honey?
<s> I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
<s> You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
<s> Depends on the state.
<s> What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
<s> You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
<s> So you pay off our customs officials?
<s> Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
<s> I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
<s> I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
<s> The police won't find your car.
<s> Then I guess I'm going by myself.
<s> Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
<s> If I can.
<s> I'm aware of that.
<s> That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
<s> This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
<s> Just tell me where she is.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
<s> Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
<s> The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
<s> Bit fucking late, like.
<s> I've no fucking cigarettes.
<s> I'd fucking kill you.
<s> Eh-
<s> Because it's illegal.
<s> Easy for you to say.
<s> Certainly not.
<s> Are you clean?
<s> Unless you get caught.
<s> He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
<s> What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
<s> Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
<s> Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
<s> Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
<s> You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
<s> The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
<s> Right.
<s> Nightmare.
<s> My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
<s> Nineteen-sixty-seven.
<s> Eh - Ian Fleming?
<s> And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
<s> What about The Untouchables?
<s> Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
<s> Give me the gun.
<s> It wasn't that bad.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
<s> There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> To see you through the night that lies ahead.
<s> Your favourite dish.
<s> And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> No joy yet.
<s> Six weeks.
<s> She read it in Cosmopolitan.
<s> That's fair enough.
<s> What?
<s> No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
<s> Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
<s> Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
<s> Rescued at last.
<s> Pavel.
<s> Position, Bird of Prey?
<s> I don't have a clue.
<s> I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
<s> Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
<s> With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
<s> Why didn't you beep my communicator?
<s> Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
<s> Put it on the screen.
<s> Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
<s> Go to sleep, Spock.
<s> Goodnight, Doctor.
<s> Yes.
<s> He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
<s> Fascinating.
<s> Let me do something.
<s> But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
<s> The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
<s> Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
<s> In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
<s> You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
<s> The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
<s> Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
<s> Am I? We'll see.
<s> The ship needs its Captain.
<s> Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
<s> Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
<s> He's not?
<s> It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
<s> I cannot go with you.
<s> I belong here.
<s> Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
<s> Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
<s> Senior exec.
<s> Uh... got any cinnamon?
<s> I know, I met him.
<s> Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
<s> Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
<s> No...
<s> Right on the money!
<s> Yes, okay, exactement!
<s> Let's get outta here.
<s> I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
<s> I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
<s> There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
<s> What do you want with the Pentagon?
<s> Hah.
<s> No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
<s> Let's get some power here.
<s> Why? What are you going to do?
<s> Shhhhh.
<s> Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
<s> We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
<s> Come here.
<s> Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
<s> Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
<s> Why is everything...like this?
<s> So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
<s> Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
<s> Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
<s> Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
<s> Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
<s> Where are you off to young lady?
<s> He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
<s> Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Roger, One.  Rolling.
<s> Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
<s> This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
<s> What?
<s> Right.  She's only fourteen.
<s> She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
<s> Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
<s> Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
<s> You tell on me, I tell on you.
<s> No!  Never!
<s> Ten, Mr. Gibson.
<s> It's certainly... dramatic.
<s> Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
<s> You're damaged goods, lady.
<s> Yeah, it was wild.
<s> Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
<s> I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
<s> Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
<s> Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
<s> No.
<s> Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
<s> Sure, hon.
<s> What about Juno?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Use 'em and lose 'em.
<s> What about the husbands?
<s> Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
<s> Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
<s> No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
<s> He said he was an American agent.
<s> No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
<s> Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't.
<s> It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
<s> Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
<s> I'm married!
<s> I don't know.  I have to think...
<s> Helen.
<s> He wants to speak with you.
<s> Knock wood.
<s> Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
<s> What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
<s> And here we are.
<s> Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
<s> It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
<s> Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
<s> Sure. Why not?
<s> What time is it?
<s> Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
<s> What do you do?
<s> Very much. Now, where were we?
<s> I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
<s> And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
<s> That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
<s> I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
<s> At the movies?
<s> I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
<s> My pimp.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
<s> You will?
<s> Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
<s> I just gotta get somethin'.
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
<s> No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
<s> What?
<s> Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
<s> You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
<s> What?
<s> Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
<s> That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
<s> She's with me.
<s> Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
<s> He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
<s> Elliot.
<s> In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
<s> This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
<s> - that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
<s> He trusts you?
<s> No problems on both counts.
<s> I guess so. Follow me.
<s> No.
<s> Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
<s> A Norms in Van Nuys.
<s> We grew up together.
<s> Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
<s> You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
<s> Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
<s> Who is he?
<s> I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
<s> Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
<s> That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
<s> What about him?
<s> Where'd you come from?
<s> I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
<s> Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
<s> Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
<s> I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
<s> Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
<s> If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
<s> Do you know where we can find him?
<s> Donowitz, he said.
<s> Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
<s> I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
<s> It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
<s> So that...???
<s> They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
<s> No.
<s> You wouldn't understand.
<s> No, 1995 is the past.
<s> What?
<s> 1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
<s> You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
<s> It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
<s> You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
<s> I thought you didn't know how to drive.
<s> No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
<s> It was?  I didn't...know.
<s> They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
<s> Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
<s> So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
<s> I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
<s> I need to make a telephone call.
<s> What's that mean?
<s> Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
<s> And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
<s> Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
<s> How did you find me?
<s> They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
<s> It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
<s> Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
<s> Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
<s> He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
<s> I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
<s> I need a ticket.
<s> I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
<s> How much.
<s> Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
<s> A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
<s> You son of a bitch!
<s> I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
<s> I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
<s> Yeah, I'll try.
<s> Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
<s> Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
<s> John--
<s> Sheriff Potter.
<s> Who the hell is this!?
<s> You didn't hear something?
<s> My cup runneth over, beauti--
<s> You're welcome, Grace.
<s> Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
<s> Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
<s> Come here.
<s> Where?
<s> You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
<s> We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
<s> Give him the money.
<s> You heard me.  Count it out.
<s> You killed him!
<s> Where the hell am I going to go?
<s> It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
<s> Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
<s> Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
<s> Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
<s> Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
<s> I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
<s> I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
<s> That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
<s> And what does that make you?
<s> This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
<s> How much could you get?
<s> I need thirteen.
<s> You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
<s> The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
<s> And tell her what?
<s> You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
<s> There's another reason?  It better be good.
<s> What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
<s> That country shit all sounds the same to me.
<s> For what?
<s> How old are you?
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> Will you shut up!
<s> Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
<s> Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
<s> I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
<s> No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
<s> A hundred-forty-five really.
<s> I guess.
<s> Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
<s> Yeah, sure.  You got change?
<s> That's 'cause he's dead.
<s> So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
<s> No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
<s> You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
<s> Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
<s> Stand up.
<s> Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
<s> Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
<s> Darrell's a moron.
<s> Live there?
<s> You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
<s> Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
<s> Would I what?
<s> I was hoping we could talk.
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
<s> I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
<s> Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
<s> What?
<s> I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
<s> Will you shut up!
<s> Darrell--
<s> Yeah, I can fix it.
<s> Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
<s> Time.
<s> What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
<s> Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
<s> When I work on a car, I work on a car.
<s> No.
<s> Eh?
<s> No! No police.
<s> My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
<s> You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
<s> You're welcome, Grace.
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
<s> Those are white words, not ours.
<s> Like you.
<s> Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
<s> How do you know he's still not here?
<s> Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
<s> I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.
<s> Walk away.
<s> Try me.
<s> You don't have any money put away, do you?
<s> Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
<s> Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
<s> I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
<s> We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
<s> Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
<s> You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
<s> But we all need that too. Hold him.
<s> 'Cause I love you.
<s> One way.
<s> Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
<s> Wrong number.
<s> They look nice.
<s> I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
<s> You didn't hear something?
<s> There's someone in the house.
<s> Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
<s> You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
<s> What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
<s> Is Noel in?
<s> Jesus.
<s> Rust?
<s> Seventy-five percent.
<s> You assumed wrong.
<s> I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
<s> We've already begun.
<s> Is there a problem?
<s> One last question.
<s> That's not what I witnessed David.
<s> Yes he is.
<s> I won't make any noise.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I see.
<s> Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
<s> It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
<s> I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
<s> Against a window.
<s> No.
<s> How long have you been married?
<s> No?
<s> Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
<s> I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
<s> You ain't dead.
<s> They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
<s> Shit and fried eggs.
<s> Property.
<s> I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
<s> You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
<s> You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
<s> I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
<s> I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
<s> "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
<s> Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
<s> Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
<s> Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
<s> N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
<s> Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
<s> Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
<s> Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
<s> Shut up, Kid.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Eleven.
<s> Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I didn't see nothin' planted.
<s> I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
<s> Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
<s> Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
<s> I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
<s> I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
<s> I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
<s> Nothin's bent.
<s> You gonna share your half with him?
<s> Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Plenty of times.
<s> Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
<s> Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
<s> He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
<s> Bear with me here...
<s> &lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
<s> They'll never stop.
<s> I hope I didn't disturb you.
<s> Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
<s> RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
<s> Can we stealth these guys?
<s> Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
<s> County. I was in for fraud.
<s> If you'll just let me -
<s> You okay?
<s> Well, I'm sorry.
<s> Not if we do it my way.
<s> Russian, I think. I don't know.
<s> Just do what I tell you.
<s> You know damn well, dead-man.
<s> Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
<s> Mr. Soze will be most -
<s> You're lying.
<s> I shivved him.
<s> Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
<s> Who is he?
<s> What'the fuck is that?
<s> Two hours, tops.
<s> Which is shit.
<s> If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
<s> You know damn well what I think.
<s> I know he was good.
<s> Keaton was a piece of shit.
<s> I just want to hear your story.
<s> I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
<s> I'm not a rat.
<s> You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
<s> The D.A. gave me immunity.
<s> Is he the one that killed Keaton?
<s> Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT.

<s> Kobayashi.
<s> And this is why you never told the D.A.
<s> This is totally irrelevant.
<s> Why didn't you say anything?
<s> I don't.
<s> I said I never heard of him.
<s> I don't
<s> It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
<s> Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
<s> Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
<s> ... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.

<s> She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
<s> Yes!
<s> No.
<s> Huh!
<s> I wouldn't do it.
<s> No.
<s> `They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
<s> Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
<s> ...What difference would...
<s> No, you did fine.
<s> I.  Yes.  It is.
<s> She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
<s> You're going to settle out of court?
<s> I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
<s> Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
<s> I understand.
<s> ... that's perfectly all right.
<s> To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
<s> I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
<s> No.
<s> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
<s> Ready, your Honor.
<s> Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.

<s> So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
<s> Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You use their witness.
<s> ...one of the other nurses?
<s> The 'History'...?
<s> ...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
<s> We got to talk.
<s> Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
<s> I don't want a mistrial.
<s> ... You saw her?
<s> You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
<s> Mrs...
<s> Yes.
<s> She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
<s> We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
<s> Yes.
<s> The Big Boy did...?
<s> Me, too.
<s> It's not my line.
<s> There are things you didn't tell me.
<s> Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
<s> Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
<s> Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
<s> Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
<s> What happened?
<s> Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
<s> Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
<s> Let me come in.
<s> Your name. And --
<s> But you haven't lived here long.
<s> An hour?
<s> Don't go.
<s> No, Judy, you don't understand.
<s> I just want to see you as much as I can!
<s> Yes. Yes, I do.
<s> Ah, no!
<s> Too late. I've got my face on.
<s> So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
<s> No! Let me go!
<s> But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
<s> I don't know... Switzerland?
<s> Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
<s> This afternoon.
<s> Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
<s> I... didn't know where you lived.
<s> My name is John Ferguson.
<s> No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
<s> Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
<s> You've nothing to apologize for.
<s> The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
<s> What?
<s> Good-bye.
<s> Shopping?
<s> What?!
<s> No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
<s> This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
<s> At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
<s> Please let me go.
<s> Please answer my question.
<s> I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
<s> I'm having one now.
<s> Oh!
<s> What a pleasant hobby.
<s> That's following a train of thought.
<s> That's Skid Row... isn't it?
<s> He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
<s> How?
<s> Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
<s> Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
<s> Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
<s> Who's the guy, who's the wife?
<s> Think?  Well, what do you think?
<s> Mmm, yeah, I guess...
<s> If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
<s> What is it, a still life?
<s> What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
<s> How?
<s> Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
<s> Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
<s> That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
<s> You're interrupting a personal conversation.
<s> It's sacrilegious.
<s> You're pathetic.
<s> You want to hear me out?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
<s> That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
<s> We can do this. We can get her out of here.
<s> What?
<s> According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
<s> No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
<s> Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
<s> I can't do this.
<s> They're on me. They're smoking me out!
<s> It has worked.
<s> There is no candy!
<s> What.
<s> So where's that leave us?
<s> Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
<s> So who's the lucky guy?
<s> That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
<s> Give me two more.
<s> He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
<s> Who's up for making some real money?
<s> Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
<s> I can't.
<s> Nobody knows.
<s> I'm talking about prayer.
<s> He's having a problem here.
<s> What is the question you asked me?
<s> Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hear what?
<s> I'm serious.
<s> You hate women.
<s> Not really, no.
<s> You will not screw this up.
<s> Goosed!
<s> I think I forgot the tent.
<s> It's vile!
<s> Of course.
<s> We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
<s> I love you.
<s> Well, can you come back inside?
<s> Are they fighting?
<s> Do you love me?
<s> Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
<s> What money?
<s> You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
<s> You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
<s> I love you dad.
<s> Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
<s> I don't hear it.
<s> A move?
<s> A mutant species.
<s> Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
<s> You'd like me to kill them?
<s> Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
<s> Two.
<s> A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
<s> In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
<s> You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
<s> How could anybody behave like that?
<s> Whatever you like.
<s> Today I can refuse you nothing.
<s> It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
<s> I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
<s> But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
<s> Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
<s> I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
<s> Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
<s> Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
<s> He was asking for it.
<s> Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
<s> Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
<s> There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
<s> Where's the dough?
<s> There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
<s> I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
<s> Stop this!
<s> Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
<s> He couldn't get through the door, then?
<s> Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
<s> But, miss ...
<s> When you are, miss.
<s> Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
<s> You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
<s> From the terrace.
<s> It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
<s> Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
<s> He was a computer program for crissake.
<s> Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
<s> No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
<s> You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
<s> I understand... I understand perfectly.
<s> He hears...everything.
<s> Then fix it.
<s> I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
<s> Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
<s> I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
<s> All my work is my finest.
<s> I think I understand what you have in mind...
<s> No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
<s> In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
<s> He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
<s> Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
<s> Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
<s> Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
<s> I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
<s> What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
<s> You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
<s> This is my area of expertise.
<s> You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
<s> They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
<s> Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
<s> Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
<s> ...I think so...You?
<s> You won't want to watch. Turn around.
<s> DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
<s> Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
<s> My...secret.
<s> Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
<s> Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
<s> You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
<s> <u>Lure</u> him. 
<s> We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
<s> Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
<s> What can it hurt is they offend me.
<s> ...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
<s> Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
<s> He's not fine.
<s> Come on.
<s> ...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
<s> What rig?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
<s> Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
<s> I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
<s> ....we landing?
<s> ...that's the general idea.
<s> <u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
<s> Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
<s> In the yellow ribbon.
<s> <u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
<s> An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
<s> ...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
<s> Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
<s> <u>So</u> forth...
<s> ...Stanley Moss...
<s> Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
<s> Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
<s> ...they just hadn't thought it through...
<s> No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
<s> Fine. 
<s> ...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
<s> Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
<s> How do we explain <u>that</u>?
<s> Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
<s> Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
<s> Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
<s> What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
<s> Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
<s> Why Albania?
<s> It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
<s> Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
<s> The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
<s> No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
<s> ...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
<s> Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
<s> In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
<s> What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in...

<s> Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
<s> Big mistake.
<s> Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.

Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.

<s> What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
<s> Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...

<s> Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...

<s> Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
<s> I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
<s> Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
<s> First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
<s> ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
<s> What'd you tell him?
<s> Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
<s> We are?
<s> Nah, she asked the wrong question.
<s> Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
<s> ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
<s> There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
<s> Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
<s> Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
<s> Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
<s> My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
<s> But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
<s> "All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
<s> Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
<s> I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
<s> A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
<s> You really do believe in destiny?
<s> That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
<s> Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
<s> Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
<s> Why?
<s> Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
<s> Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
<s> Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
<s> There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
<s> It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
<s> No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
<s> Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
<s> Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
<s> Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
<s> I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
<s> Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
<s> It's eleven forty-five let's go
<s> Hi
<s> It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
<s> Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
<s> No?
<s> A party at a waxwork huh?
<s> I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
<s> Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
<s> Right behind you.
<s> Sell my soul?
<s> Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
<s> You guys are being real assholes
<s> No, he wouldn't.
<s> I know he does.
<s> So much.
<s> Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
<s> How do you know it's a she?
<s> Yes, but...
<s> That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
<s> I've never even met you.
<s> Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's fine.
<s> I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
<s> She never mentioned her father.
<s> You must have been very proud.
<s> Stop.
<s> She's making this up.
<s> I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
<s> Okay, I'm a little tender.
<s> She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
<s> Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's alright.
<s> Jody, she's alive.
<s> I was down in Adamant...
<s> Why?
<s> We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
<s> What is it?
<s> It's Saturday.
<s> Nice.  Almost done.
<s> No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
<s> I am, really.
<s> Not the focus.
<s> Yup.
<s> Mmm.
<s> After that.
<s> More or less.
<s> I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
<s> I'd never be able to live with mysel--
<s> Mmnph.
<s> I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
<s> Really?
<s> You are so brilliant.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
<s> What?
<s> Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
<s> Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
<s> What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
<s> I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
<s> Harvey says he's amazing.
<s> Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
<s> Then where is she?
<s> Are you glad?  I'm glad.
<s> When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
<s> In the living room...
<s> ...Please stop...
<s> ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
<s> And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
<s> We don't know that for sure.
<s> Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
<s> Don't think so.
<s> Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
<s> I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
<s> :No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
<s> :Well, they are.
<s> Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
<s> But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
<s> Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
<s> You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
<s> Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
<s> I under5tand.  All the same
<s> Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
<s> I'll tell OR we're bringing -
<s> Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
<s> I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
<s> Tell me what I am, Rowan.
<s> They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
<s> How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
<s> I'm glad you're around to say it.
<s> Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
<s> As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
<s> Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
<s> It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
<s> Really...?  Your family there...?
<s> Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
<s> Captain's orders.
<s> Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
<s> He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
<s> Let's see.
<s> Hello..
<s> No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
<s> That's cause we're below sea level.
<s> Gotcha.
<s> Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
<s> I just - hate it when they're - finished.
<s> You can't just -
<s> The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
<s> Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
<s> No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
<s> Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
<s> Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
<s> Yes - I have had it for years.
<s> I think I will pass...
<s> No she didn't...
<s> I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
<s> Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
<s> Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
<s> CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
<s> It's what you would do to me
<s> I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
<s> No he had to - he's just - he's out...
<s> No worries
<s> And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
<s> Yes...?
<s> Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
<s> You and your pep talks.
<s> Were you always this sick?
<s> Astronomical.
<s> Perv.
<s> This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
<s> What is it now?
<s> Dead?
<s> ...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
<s> Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
<s> God, I love being dead.
<s> SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
<s> You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
<s> Do it?
<s> You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
<s> Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
<s> I guess.
<s> ...not the pit.
<s> Got it.
<s> I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
<s> Hang in there, I'll think of something.
<s> If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
<s> I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
<s> Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
<s> Most places are, Jimmy.
<s> Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
<s> Me-ow.
<s> I have absolutely no intention--
<s> You never know around here.
<s> He phoned it in.
<s> Eventually you'll let go.
<s> I know.
<s> Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
<s> I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
<s> Yellow pages?
<s> You better.
<s> What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
<s> Like what?
<s> Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
<s> Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
<s> Rules are rules.
<s> Of course I like girls.
<s> As much as possible.
<s> YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
<s> In other words, our scope is too narrow.
<s> That's perfect.
<s> I can't wait to see the pictures.
<s> Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
<s> We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
<s> What about the blood?
<s> What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
<s> She still work there?
<s> Was there ever any kind of investigation...
<s> Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
<s> Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
<s> Unless what?
<s> Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
<s> Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
<s> No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
<s> You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
<s> Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
<s> You didn't cuff her?
<s> Oh, for Christ's sake.
<s> What brain?
<s> Curiosity, I guess.
<s> You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
<s> I'm not on your property!
<s> Hi, Mon.
<s> Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
<s> Why can't you come...
<s> Hello.
<s> Duquette.  Forget him...
<s> And you believe her?
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> So Suzie, you called us, remember?
<s> You got something against cigarettes?
<s> Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
<s> The one you bought at school.
<s> In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
<s> That's right.
<s> Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
<s> That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
<s> Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
<s> Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
<s> The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
<s> Hi, Sandy.
<s> Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
<s> Shit. Here we go again.
<s> Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
<s> Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
<s> I'll work on it.
<s> Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
<s> It's a repeating steam cannon!
<s> Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
<s> Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
<s> Relax.  We're almost there.
<s> Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
<s> Oh, I see, an easy plan!
<s> Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
<s> Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
<s> My... the wild west.
<s> I don't like to lose, either.
<s> I've had some practice.
<s> I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
<s> Then come with us.
<s> Too bad you're not more like your father.
<s> I'm not going to let this baby die.
<s> Madmartigan.
<s> I will!  But I need help!
<s> You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
<s> I don't know.
<s> These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
<s> Elora Danan!
<s> You?
<s> The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
<s> Who?
<s> Want me to carry Elora?
<s> Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
<s> We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
<s> No!
<s> Shhhhh!
<s> We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
<s> His will.
<s> There's nobody here.
<s> You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
<s> Surrender!!
<s> Courage, Willow.
<s> Me neither!
<s> Who is that horrible friend of yours?
<s> Who is he?
<s> No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
<s> Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
<s> I can't see anything--she's too bright!
<s> Not one this big.
<s> Sorry. It's important.
<s> I thought I was the English.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Who'd you see?
<s> Okay, Mr. Book.
<s> Who else knows?
<s> Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
<s> Move! Or you die right here!
<s> Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
<s> He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
<s> The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
<s> Home.
<s> What?
<s> Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
<s> A real fireball.
<s> There was.
<s> Aren't you? After today?
<s> Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
<s> I didn't even know about it.
<s> Probably.
<s> I admit I don't know where he is.
<s> You are acting like one!
<s> I don't think she knows.
<s> Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
<s> You might have killed him!
<s> My son is out there!
<s> Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
<s> I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
<s> The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
<s> Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
<s> Goodbye, folks!
<s> This?
<s> All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
<s> Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
<s> Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
<s> Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
<s> Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
<s> You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
<s> How did you guess?
<s> Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
<s> Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
<s> Yes...That's Aunt Em.
<s> Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
<s> I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
<s> But you couldn't have been, could you?
<s> Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
<s> Oh --!
<s> I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
<s> Oh! Oh!
<s> I'm sure he could give you some courage.
<s> Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
<s> Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
<s> Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, come on.
<s> Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
<s> Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
<s> No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
<s> They would?
<s> Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
<s> To Oz?
<s> Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
<s> Oh --
<s> Oh --
<s> Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
<s> You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
<s> Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
<s> Don't you start it, too!
<s> Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
<s> Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
<s> Yeah!
<s> Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
<s> Imposserous!
<s> Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
<s> To Oz!
<s> Here, Tin Man -- help me.
<s> I can fairly hear my heart beating!
<s> Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
<s> Now, now, don't fret.
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
<s> When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
<s> She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
<s> We go down to the torpedo bay.
<s> Like riding a bike.
<s> But what if...
<s> Perhaps after this ... test?
<s> Shes not a girl anymore.
<s> Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
<s> Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
<s> The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
<s> Renard.
<s> The worm on the hook again.
<s> And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
<s> Your last chance. Give me the name.
<s> I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
<s> Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
<s> You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
<s> Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
<s> Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
<s> Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
<s> Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
<s> Its the only way out...
<s> ...you should rest.
<s> We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
<s> No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
<s> Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
<s> How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
<s> A rope!
<s> How appropriate.
<s> Bond!
<s> Please.
<s> Your father...
<s> Someone will come.
<s> And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
<s> Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
<s> Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
<s> Collect me?
<s> Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
<s> Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
<s> You're the only human being I care for.
<s> Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
<s> Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
<s> The missing scientists.
<s> Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
<s> Antarctica??
<s> It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
<s> That's because --
<s> Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
<s> What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
<s> Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
<s> Where did he go?
<s> Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
<s> Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
<s> Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
<s> We should get back --  What?
<s> Isn't it true that you --
<s> What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
<s> I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
<s> Jon??  You mean he's --
<s> Laurie!  Good to see you.
<s> I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
<s> ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
<s> Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
<s> The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
<s> Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
<s> Is that a fact?
<s> You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
<s> You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
<s> We're not after car thieves here.
<s> Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
<s> But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
<s> He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
<s> Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
<s> Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
<s> If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
<s> Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
<s> I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
<s> I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
<s> When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
<s> Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
<s> He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
<s> You can't talk to it?
<s> It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
<s> They come in any other styles or colors?
<s> That one I'm real familiar with.
<s> I'm through, Xander.
<s> You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
<s> I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
<s> You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
<s> The corner. Anarchy 99.
<s> Yeah, thanks a lot.
<s> This pizda? Never seen him before.
<s> Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
<s> Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
<s> That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
<s> How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
<s> I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
<s> We all do.
<s> I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
<s> We have to find Magneto.
<s> Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
<s> I wanted to talk to you.
<s> Not interested.
<s> He takes his work seriously.
<s> Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
<s> You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
<s> Deal.
<s> What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
<s> To find Rogue.
<s> They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
<s> She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
<s> ALIVE.
<s> Not at the cost of lives, Max.
<s> Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
<s> Yes, my dear, he is.
<s> No!
<s> Poppycock!
<s> Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
<s> What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
<s> MMmmm.
<s> Well... yes.
<s> I...
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, nice.
<s> You're incorrigible!
<s> Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
<s> Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
<s> Is it worth taking a chance?
<s> Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
<s> Yes!... the laboratory.
<s> I think you must be mistaken, sir.
<s> I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
<s> But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
<s> Break that old man's violin.
<s> Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
<s> Fron kon steen!
<s> No, Fred ereck.
<s> Wockers with the knockers???
<s> Just putting up some tea.
<s> And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
<s> He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
<s> You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
<s> Give -- me -- your -- hand!
<s> It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
<s> We only arrived a few minutes ago.
<s> Well...
<s> Well, this explains the music.
<s> I think so.
<s> MMmmm.
<s> Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
<s> Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
<s> Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
<s> Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
<s> But will they make good use of them?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
<s> Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
<s> Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
<s> Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
