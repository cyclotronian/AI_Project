<s> Cameron.
<s> Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
<s> Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
<s> Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
<s> Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
<s> I was?
<s> What good stuff?
<s> I hope so.
<s> Expensive?
<s> Hi, Joey.
<s> Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
<s> Like you care.
<s> As in...
<s> You did what?
<s> I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
<s> So did you
<s> No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
<s> Otherwise known as an orgy?
<s> It's just a party. Daddy.
<s> You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
<s> North, actually.  How'd you   ?
<s> Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
<s> Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
<s> He seems like he thrives on danger
<s> Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
<s> That's what I just said
<s> It's a lung cancer issue
<s> Okay!  I wasn't sure
<s> It's off. The whole thing.
<s> She kissed me.
<s> You get the girl.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Are you lost?
<s> We don't chat.
<s> What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
<s> Block E?
<s> Does it matter?
<s> Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
<s> My mission in life.
<s> I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
<s> And why would I do that?
<s> Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
<s> That's what you want, isn't it?
<s> Funny, you're the only one
<s> I know, just let me sleep
<s> Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
<s> Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
<s> Do what?
<s> Look up, sunshine
<s> Maybe.
<s> Hearsay.
<s> Go to the prom with me
<s> You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
<s> It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
<s> Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
<s> I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
<s> No, Daddy.
<s> The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
<s> No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
<s> Yeah...
<s> The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
<s> We're your guys.
<s> I'm likin' you guys better
<s> Make anyone cry today?
<s> Dr. Ruth?
<s> The water's going putrid in the barrels.
<s> Excellency, you are right.
<s> Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
<s> Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
<s> On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
<s> Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
<s> I am busy inside.
<s> Appointment to what?
<s> Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
<s> I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
<s> Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
<s> ... for a commoner?
<s> Tell the Chief we thank him.
<s> Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
<s> Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
<s> That's what it says.
<s> With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
<s> So was Christ!
<s> Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
<s> You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
<s> A woman?
<s> Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
<s> If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
<s> Come over here.
<s> You think I don't know that?
<s> You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
<s> Is this true, Brother Buyl?
<s> He must be replaced.
<s> Then why?
<s> Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
<s> Give me another one, please.
<s> Divorced.
<s> Yes, I considered it.
<s> I know.
<s> They're not gonna send you right back.
<s> I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
<s> Right.
<s> It was my decision, not his.
<s> Who do you think, Chief?!
<s> Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
<s> Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
<s> Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
<s> Vodka tonic.
<s> What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
<s> Did you tell him you did?
<s> Describe him.
<s> Watch the news?
<s> Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
<s> Good.  Good.  Commendable.
<s> Stay here.
<s> This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
<s> Better than one.
<s> I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
<s> You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
<s> Hey.  I'm a professional.
<s> Just a shower?
<s> Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
<s> How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
<s> What do you want?
<s> If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
<s> There are two bodies found at this point.
<s> We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
<s> I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
<s> He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
<s> Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
<s> Answer the phone.
<s> I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
<s> Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
<s> Yeah.  I promise.
<s> See you later.  Good luck.
<s> Jesus Christ.
<s> Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
<s> I am butcher.
<s> Dog food.
<s> No.  Are you proposing?
<s> Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
<s> Two weeks holiday.
<s> I have five-hundred dollars.
<s> How long are you planning to stay?
<s> Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
<s> Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
<s> I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
<s> I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
<s> And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
<s> Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
<s> Surprise!  Surprise!
<s> As a plumber?!
<s> A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
<s> I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
<s> This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
<s> What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
<s> Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
<s> Clean?
<s> But you knew that, right?
<s> Your doctor?
<s> Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
<s> We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
<s> Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
<s> Yes.
<s> That seems very unlikely.
<s> Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
<s> Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
<s> I guess it isn't.
<s> Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
<s> I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
<s> I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
<s> Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
<s> Yes, it is, Hal.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
<s> I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
<s> Well, what is it?
<s> Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
<s> I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
<s> Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
<s> How is gregor?
<s> Well, that does sound very odd.
<s> Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
<s> I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
<s> Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
<s> Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
<s> You got a real big mouth, convict.
<s> He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
<s> Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
<s> Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
<s> Yeah, i been waiting three years.
<s> No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
<s> Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
<s> Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
<s> Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
<s> Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
<s> Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
<s> Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
<s> Last night, two nights ago, three?
<s> How much?
<s> ...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
<s> If they don't tell me what I need to know...
<s> I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
<s> Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
<s> Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
<s> You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
<s> Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
<s> Partnership?
<s> There's nothin' to talk about.
<s> And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
<s> Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
<s> Jack?
<s> I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
<s> Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
<s> Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
<s> Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
<s> What?
<s> I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
<s> When? How?
<s> I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
<s> What's wrong with that?
<s> I guess he got the message...
<s> What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
<s> Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
<s> You sure you want me to?
<s> Yeah, one of my favorites.
<s> Jack, are you okay?
<s> That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
<s> Hi, it's me...
<s> Tell me.
<s> How would you know?
<s> That's no bull.
<s> Can't complain.
<s> No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
<s> I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
<s> It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
<s> This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
<s> Five bills.
<s> San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
<s> You know exactly where they are!
<s> I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
<s> ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
<s> Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
<s> I know...
<s> That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
<s> Dallas. Korben Dallas.
<s> It means, "Never without my permission".
<s> What kind of mission?
<s> Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
<s> Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
<s> When is she not in trouble?
<s> One more reason to shoot first eh?
<s> What is?
<s> Yes. Of course..
<s> Perfect.
<s> I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
<s> Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
<s> You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
<s> How do I look?
<s> Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
<s> So, just how big was this fare?
<s> It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
<s> Vito Cornelius?
<s> When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
<s> You little sleaze bag!
<s> How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
<s> This is a police control action..
<s> Uh... not really.
<s> Not without Leeloo.
<s> Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
<s> Just one... why me?
<s> And the third one?
<s> I thought you were divorced.
<s> Uh..you're welcome.
<s> Cornelius..
<s> ...Hoppi-hoppa.
<s> Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
<s> I told you not to read all that crap!
<s> I want to sleep... forever...
<s> You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
<s> Uh..
<s> You're welcome..
<s> Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
<s> Wonderful!
<s> How much time is left?
<s> Options.
<s> Gentlemen?
<s> To fame.. salud..
<s> Yes, Sir!
<s> Got it.
<s> Do you know how much I missed you?
<s> Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
<s> What's wrong?  Are you alright?
<s> I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
<s> Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
<s> Amy...
<s> Mrs. Christian.
<s> What you see is what I got, mister.
<s> What can I do for you today?
<s> I'll consider it.
<s> Machine.
<s> We can do that.
<s> I'd rather you didn't.
<s> Right here.
<s> Where are the women?
<s> Leave him alone.
<s> Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
<s> Any good?
<s> Eddie.
<s> I know what you did.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
<s> Something like that.
<s> Why?
<s> Show me where you buried her.
<s> Easy enough for you.
<s> The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
<s> That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
<s> You'll get it when we get there.
<s> Pardon me?
<s> I'll risk it.
<s> Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
<s> Good for you.
<s> Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
<s> Specialty product.
<s> It's their Presidential Suite.
<s> I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
<s> I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
<s> I try to be.
<s> I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
<s> Do you want to tell me what you found?
<s> I'm afraid I don't...
<s> No.
<s> The checks were for odd amounts...
<s> Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
<s> I hope it's nothing serious.
<s> How will I get it to you?
<s> I don't understand, who are... ?
<s> You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
<s> No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
<s> What?
<s> Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
<s> I can't find him.
<s> Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
<s> Yeah, I'm not so sure.
<s> You could do worse.
<s> Sounds like a game show host to me.
<s> How'd you learn so much about dreams?
<s> I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
<s> That obvious, huh?
<s> Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
<s> Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
<s> It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
<s> "In her dream"?
<s> Kristen's story really got to her.
<s> Extra money, huh?
<s> The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
<s> Three days.
<s> Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
<s> It's okay, we're just about there.
<s> Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
<s> Alright, I think I see salvation...
<s> Let me talk to you.
<s> Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
<s> Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
<s> I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
<s> You just stay put.  You need rest.
<s> And ours.  It's our grandchild.
<s> How did you know that?
<s> No...
<s> Who said I...wait, what?
<s> Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
<s> They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
<s> Yeah...I guess.
<s> You're right.
<s> No.  A deal's a deal.
<s> It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
<s> Sobering...
<s> Since my little girl became a mom...
<s> No, the Dan part was nice...
<s> Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
<s> When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
<s> Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
<s> I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
<s> Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
<s> So did Dan.
<s> That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
<s> I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
<s> That's their problem.
<s> No shit.
<s> Next life.  Oh, what's that?
<s> All of us.  Right?
<s> Two hours a day, six days a week.
<s> He invited me to his house last night.
<s> I'd sooner swim!
<s> A lot of people think like that.
<s> Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
<s> 'Us?'
<s> Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
<s> Something wrong?
<s> Wonderful!
<s> Anything ---
<s> If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
<s> - for horrors like yourself?
<s> Your friend was to remain where he was!
<s> Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
<s> Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
<s> Toward the Pole!
<s> Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
<s> You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
<s> Same old shit.
<s> Yeah. I know about that.
<s> How soon?
<s> Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
<s> Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
<s> Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
<s> Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
<s> Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
<s> Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
<s> You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
<s> You played for the Sox?
<s> How'd you get the job?
<s> Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
<s> In the chest.
<s> What blood?
<s> What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
<s> He sure as hell won't.
<s> I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
<s> Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
<s> To us it was.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> No.
<s> I called Mommy.
<s> Yes.
<s> I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
<s> I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Grandpa. My father. It's his.
<s> No.
<s> Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
<s> I know.
<s> I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
<s> Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
<s> Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
<s> Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
<s> Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
<s> Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
<s> Yeah.
<s> From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
<s> Said what?
<s> Yeah. I mean that.
<s> Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
<s> But not now.
<s> You knew me as a kid.
<s> It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
<s> Good.
<s> It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
<s> Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
<s> Yes. Here's your ticket.
<s> Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
<s> His office. You mean my old office.
<s> He got his deer yet?
<s> Love! I'm made of love!
<s> Crawl!
<s> Wade?
<s> No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
<s> I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
<s> That it wasn't an accident.
<s> Alice...
<s> Some kids were teasing you?
<s> Hey, you guys back already?
<s> Been better, Dad... You?
<s> Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
<s> Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
<s> Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
<s> An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
<s> I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
<s> Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
<s> why did they do that?
<s> The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
<s> Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
<s> Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
<s> Good. Good.
<s> Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
<s> Gravity.
<s> Can't it wait?
<s> Rose, I don't have time for this.
<s> And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
<s> What?
<s> Please... don't start with me.
<s> White House Situation room.
<s> You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
<s> No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
<s> I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
<s> A MiG? Where the hell are we?
<s> Commissioner.
<s> Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
<s> Not now, Elaine!
<s> Ted, there's no time to explain.
<s> That was very well put, Ted.
<s> I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
<s> Not when I'm with you, Ted.
<s> I mean for Ted.
<s> No, I've been excited before.
<s> He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
<s> You can do it from up here, Captain.
<s> Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
<s> What should I say?
<s> Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
<s> Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
<s> Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
<s> I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
<s> Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
<s> I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
<s> Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
<s> Yes. Yes, of course.
<s> No.
<s> Ted!
<s> And a little ice.
<s> It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
<s> What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
<s> I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Who wants to be first?
<s> I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
<s> Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
<s> Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
<s> ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
<s> Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
<s> Huh?
<s> Of course.
<s> Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
<s> The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
<s> Show me.
<s> I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
<s> Yes...
<s> This is becoming a serious breach of security.
<s> Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
<s> That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
<s> There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
<s> And that fits?
<s> So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
<s> Did you learn anything?
<s> But I-- .
<s> Screw me?  That can't be right.
<s> In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
<s> Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
<s> To the... to the beach?
<s> I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
<s> Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
<s> The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
<s> Fuck procedure.
<s> We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
<s> Who else can I ask around here?
<s> Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
<s> Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
<s> Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
<s> Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
<s> Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
<s> See you soon.
<s> She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
<s> You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
<s> Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
<s> Hear me out...
<s> I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
<s> What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
<s> Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
<s> Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
<s> She's right.
<s> Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
<s> Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
<s> We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
<s> PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
<s> Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
<s> Aye-firmative.
<s> I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
<s> Poor bastard.
<s> Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
<s> Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
<s> Yeah.  I've noticed.
<s> The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
<s> We ain't going anywhere.
<s> Don't be long, Ellen.
<s> Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
<s> Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
<s> Uh, what's next?
<s> Think of what?  We're fucked.
<s> I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
<s> They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
<s> Yeah.  What?
<s> That's right.
<s> Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
<s> It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
<s> Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
<s> Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
<s> My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
<s> Well, what does it matter to you?
<s> Extremely clever.
<s> Don't bother.
<s> Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
<s> Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
<s> Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
<s> Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
<s> How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
<s> I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
<s> Who the devil are you? What do you want?
<s> Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
<s> Em iram! Em iram!
<s> Oh, leave me alone.
<s> You borrowed money from your mother?
<s> Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
<s> Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
<s> Tell them to go!
<s> I love you! I love you!
<s> Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
<s> What does she want?
<s> Wolfi! Your father is dead.
<s> I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
<s> Oh, Stanzi.
<s> Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
<s> You'd think I was mad.
<s> Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
<s> Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
<s> Oh, thank you, sir!
<s> Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
<s> He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
<s> You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
<s> But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
<s> Be careful!
<s> It's just a trifle, of course.
<s> Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
<s> Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
<s> I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
<s> Yes?
<s> Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
<s> Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
<s> In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
<s> Thank you, Sire!
<s> What is it?
<s> Ah! By all means.
<s> Yes, Sire.
<s> I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
<s> Well. There it is.
<s> Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
<s> Am I not welcome?
<s> How is your financial situation?
<s> They say you're in debt.
<s> It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
<s> Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
<s> But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
<s> No one calls you that.
<s> Really? What is it he's writing?
<s> In there, sir.
<s> Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
<s> Are you Herr Mozart?
<s> Yes, well, it's all good fun.
<s> German!
<s> Wolfi!
<s> Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
<s> Can I see it?
<s> Well, we can.
<s> And which one of them do you want me to teach?
<s> Madame.
<s> Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
<s> No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
<s> Ah!
<s> It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
<s> So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
<s> Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
<s> You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
<s> It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
<s> How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
<s> Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
<s> Thank you! Oh, thank you.
<s> How could it not, Excellency?
<s> What work?
<s> How much?
<s> I'm too young to be so sick.
<s> No! No, it's him!
<s> The man. He's here.
<s> Finish what?
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
<s> Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
<s> I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
<s> What for?
<s> Taking out what you should never have put in.
<s> Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
<s> A little modesty would suit you better.
<s> Mozart -
<s> In the sight of God that is a sin.
<s> I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
<s> That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
<s> Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
<s> Ah - you've heard that?
<s> And do they believe it?
<s> Do you believe it?
<s> He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
<s> You cannot say that!
<s> The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
<s> I did.
<s> Yes?
<s> Incredible.
<s> About the ballet.
<s> Yes, in the third act.
<s> I can't wait.
<s> What do you mean - now?
<s> I agree, Baron.
<s> Excuse me, my dear.
<s> Of course.
<s> Dr. Hirsch?
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> Has his friend appeared to him again?
<s> I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
<s> He's fine. We'll come right over.
<s> Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
<s> I dream of death mostly.
<s> Shall I read to you?
<s> Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
<s> Now I'm embarrassed.
<s> I'll let you know the next full moon.
<s> It's nice to see you.
<s> I was awake and he was in my room.
<s> Do me an enormous favor?
<s> David, don't lose control.
<s> Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
<s> You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
<s> Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
<s> You could have told them!
<s> Alex?
<s> You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
<s> I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Listen, at least it's warm in here.
<s> It's a five-pointed star.
<s> You ask them.
<s> Yeah?
<s> There aren't any coyotes in England.
<s> I don't know. Come on.
<s> Plan?
<s> No.
<s> Not far enough. Come on.
<s> Are you going to help me up?
<s> We were attacked by a werewolf.
<s> What do you think?
<s> The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
<s> If I was still alive, I probably would.
<s> Thank you.
<s> What about the zoo?
<s> We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
<s> I'd like some tea, please.
<s> That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
<s> I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
<s> Matt?
<s> Yeah.
<s> It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
<s> I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
<s> Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
<s> Not yet, Mr. Clark.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
<s> Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
<s> Take it easy, Clark.
<s> That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
<s> So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
<s> Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
<s> Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
<s> They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
<s> Why not?
<s> You don't have to do nothing.
<s> No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
<s> I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> John, how's your wife this morning?
<s> Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
<s> That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
<s> Of course, let them in! You're late now.
<s> Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
<s> It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
<s> In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
<s> Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
<s> Where is he now?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
<s> There you are.
<s> I can't tell you.
<s> It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Did you get the case for the securities?
<s> What'll we do?
<s> I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
<s> It's his life insurance money, you know.
<s> Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
<s> With what?
<s> Oh, ten dollars
<s> A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
<s> All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
<s> Yeah, swell.
<s> Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
<s> Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
<s> Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
<s> Yes, why?
<s> Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
<s> Then where were you?
<s> Okay, Matt.
<s> Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
<s> I guess so.
<s> They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
<s> Sometimes a wound will kill.
<s> Never a good thing.
<s> How?
<s> It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
<s> As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
<s> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<s> Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
<s> They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
<s> Best damn plan I heard all war.
<s> Tell me.
<s> I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
<s> What's going on?
<s> I could use the walk.
<s> After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
<s> So what do we do, General Lee?
<s> I got three.
<s> Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
<s> What will be?
<s> Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
<s> You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
<s> I'm thinking...
<s> Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
<s> Sadie was not a man!
<s> They gonna rush us?
<s> Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
<s> Ho-yah!
<s> It's a secret.
<s> My little Web did that?
<s> Mm-hmm.
<s> You're doing just fine.
<s> Maybe, maybe...
<s> I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
<s> What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Bob's upset.
<s> Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
<s> Jesse, we're outlaws.
<s> A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
<s> No, I --
<s> I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> But he killed a lot of men, too.
<s> Everything but the boring parts.
<s> You were little Jesse James when you left.
<s> If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
<s> Mmmm.
<s> You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
<s> And what's this right girl like?
<s> Frank and me have to go away for a while.
<s> When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
<s> Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
<s> You are a hell of a woman.
<s> So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
<s> You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
<s> Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
<s> I'm not hanged yet.
<s> I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
<s> No.
<s> Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
<s> You been with a girl ever?
<s> Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
<s> I hope I'm not being too forward.
<s> Lyla Devereux.
<s> Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
<s> I'm doing you folks a favor --
<s> Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
<s> I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
<s> Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
<s> Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
<s> I can't believe this.
<s> Can you put men at all four?
<s> Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
<s> The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
<s> Yes, dear.
<s> I'm ignoring you.
<s> You just haven't been looking.
<s> My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
<s> Do...what.
<s> Evelyn?
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
<s> No.
<s> Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
<s> Yes, naturally.
<s> What exactly do you mean?
<s> But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
<s> Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
<s> But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
<s> It looks that way, doesn't it?
<s> Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
<s> Leaving what?
<s> I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
<s> When?
<s> Just...say...no.
<s> No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
<s> Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
<s> Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
<s> I'm on a diet. But thank you.
<s> Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
<s> Jean? Hello? Jean?
<s> What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
<s> What do you think I do?
<s> What?
<s> Next Saturday?
<s> He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
<s> You're at Paul Owen s.
<s> No.
<s> Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
<s> No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
<s> Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
<s> Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
<s> I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
<s> It's no problem
<s> The disappearance of Paul Owen.
<s> No, really. I'm okay.
<s> Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Who do you ask?
<s> Well...
<s> No. Not really.
<s> Hang...out?
<s> I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
<s> But...has anyone seen him in London?
<s> What?
<s> Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
<s> Oh really? I didn't know that.
<s> Let's see...  That you were with-
<s> Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
<s> Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
<s> Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
<s> I'm hungry
<s> Al.
<s> I've been great. And you?
<s> Another Martini, Paul?
<s> They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
<s> What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
<s> No way. You have this -- destiny.
<s> Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
<s> Isn't that -- extreme?
<s> I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
<s> You can't just walk in, either.
<s> ...Whaddo I do?
<s> I remember.
<s> What?
<s> He has thousands of employees, Milo --
<s> Milo, you --
<s> Don't we have any chopsticks?
<s> Great.
<s> It's gonna get cold.
<s> You're just afraid to eat it.
<s> Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
<s> ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
<s> 'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
<s> 'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
<s> You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
<s> I do!
<s> Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
<s> Maybe I'm going too fast.
<s> What're you implying.
<s> It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
<s> 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
<s> ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
<s> Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
<s> 'Sorry about the late notice...
<s> I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
<s> You see what's hanging on the wall?
<s> I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Wait... He knows.
<s> 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
<s> He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
<s> Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
<s> We'll come up with the next big thing.
<s> Cool.
<s> I'm calling Gary.
<s> You're famous around here.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
<s> ...Something like that. Yeah.
<s> You're compulsive.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> They'd frame him.
<s> Before they kill somebody else, too.
<s> Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
<s> The dishes are juiced up, too.
<s> Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
<s> Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
<s> He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
<s> Oh we're not going to the campus.
<s> She's a programmer?
<s> You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
<s> Groovy.
<s> Or sometimes not at all.
<s> That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
<s> Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
<s> Kiss me.
<s> A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
<s> Thank you, Exposition.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
<s> What's the other thing you're scared of?
<s> I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
<s> Austin, I have something for you as well.
<s> Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
<s> A Chigro?
<s> Why?
<s> He's too well-protected right now.
<s> Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
<s> You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
<s> I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
<s> No, this is me in a nutshell.
<s> I am not.
<s> It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
<s> Indeed.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
<s> Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
<s> I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
<s> Danger's my middle name.
<s> I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
<s> Sure.
<s> Here, have a piece of gum.
<s> These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
<s> It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
<s> They're mutated sea bass.
<s> Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
<s> That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
<s> Not me.
<s> You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
<s> I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
<s> I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
<s> Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
<s> He's asleep.
<s> Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
<s> I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
<s> I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
<s> OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
<s> ... power ...
<s> Three days.
<s> Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
<s> Promised? Who promised?
<s> As you see.
<s> Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
<s> Ring?
<s> And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
<s> A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
<s> After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
<s> I meant me.
<s> Any other vices?
<s> You should be dead.  How do you feel?
<s> I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
<s> Why should they think that?
<s> Very good, Steed ...
<s> Any ideas?
<s> Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
<s> But if someone miniaturized the process...
<s> Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
<s> Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
<s> I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
<s> The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
<s> Orders.
<s> Winning isn't everything.
<s> Why's he called 'Invisible'?
<s> Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
<s> Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
<s> You first.
<s> It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
<s> I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
<s> Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
<s> So you say ...
<s> How did you guess?
<s> Possibly. Split personality ...
<s> She may try to kill you.
<s> How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
<s> Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
<s> I feel sure of it.
<s> Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
<s> Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
<s> I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
<s> Chulo, one thing at a time.
<s> Bond... James Bond.
<s> You dump her and I'll give you cash.
<s> Oh, come on, just a little.
<s> Ooh, be still, my heart.
<s> The best.
<s> I'm very happy for you two.
<s> Maybe it had something to do.
<s> Fan out and look for them.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Yes, sir, I am.
<s> But how can I do that?
<s> What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
<s> I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
<s> C'mere.
<s> Can't I just go with you guys?
<s> Your mother's not dead.
<s> How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
<s> You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
<s> You're so romantic...
<s> I hope those guys are all right.
<s> My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
<s> They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
<s> What are you...
<s> Why?
<s> Screw that.
<s> Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
<s> That's it.
<s> All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
<s> No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
<s> I'm trying to slash my wrists.
<s> I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
<s> Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
<s> Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
<s> Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
<s> Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
<s> She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
<s> So long, Father.
<s> Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
<s> Who?
<s> My Debbie?
<s> Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
<s> Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
<s> Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Let me take the lead, Stephen...
<s> My Lt. might have something to say about that.
<s> Just come down, John. Just --
<s> -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
<s> Who asked you?
<s> I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
<s> It's comin' along... want a beer?
<s> What, you've never seen one before?
<s> Hey! You don't know me --
<s> So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
<s> C'mon, let's crawl home.
<s> What, are you kidding? By myself?
<s> Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
<s> Saw what?
<s> Everybody did.
<s> We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
<s> "You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
<s> Jennifer.
<s> Really? No kidding.
<s> Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
<s> So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
<s> Who's doing this?
<s> -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
<s> Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
<s> You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
<s> Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
<s> Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
<s> Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
<s> Pest control.
<s> No it couldn't.
<s> What?
<s> Fire.
<s> Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
<s> Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
<s> How ya feeling?
<s> I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
<s> Like it never happened...
<s> I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
<s> You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
<s> Engine 115, right?
<s> Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
<s> Cute.
<s> -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
<s> I'll be there.
<s> I'll be there, goddamn it!
<s> He's got piano lessons.
<s> You treated me like shit.
<s> Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> You like everybody, Ronald.
<s> And old ladies?
<s> Alderman.
<s> Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
<s> She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
<s> I'm a Catholic.
<s> I was gonna bring it back myself.
<s> Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
<s> You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
<s> I forgive you.
<s> There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
<s> That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
<s> I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
<s> What case?
<s> You've really got a problem.
<s> B-L-A-K it is.
<s> BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
<s> Please.
<s> Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
<s> I'm a revolutionary.
<s> You might be right.
<s> You ain't happy about the green light?
<s> Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
<s> Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
<s> We might need some mo' money behind this.
<s> My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
<s> I'm tired of waiting.
<s> Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
<s> To what?
<s> Mantan!!
<s> How you sound?
<s> No costume.  No blackface.
<s> So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
<s> I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
<s> I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
<s> So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
<s> Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
<s> So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
<s> In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
<s> No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
<s> I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
<s> Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
<s> He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
<s> Do you know how you will use him?
<s> Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
<s> And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
<s> This is Cheeba.
<s> It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
<s> What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
<s> Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
<s> C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
<s> A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
<s> Light?
<s> You sound like the media.
<s> Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
<s> It looks delicious.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
<s> First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
<s> I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
<s> Tavis, thank you for having me.
<s> Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
<s> Oh her.
<s> So when are you comin' to pick us up?
<s> ...too late, maybe around...
<s> You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
<s> Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
<s> A song a comin' I feel.
<s> I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
<s> No, before my time.
<s> Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
<s> After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
<s> I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
<s> Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
<s> I never was more in earnest.
<s> What is your uncle's name?
<s> The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
<s> It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
<s> There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
<s> I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
<s> And his baggage?
<s> It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
<s> It must have been some other gate.
<s> Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
<s> Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
<s> I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
<s> I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
<s> Only the agency of servants.
<s> I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
<s> I have faced that problem before.
<s> It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
<s> Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
<s> Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
<s> We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
<s> With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
<s> I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
<s> Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
<s> O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
<s> I see.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes, papa.
<s> You know that was like a quadruple negative?
<s> It's ten thirty in the morning.
<s> Who?
<s> I'm -- I'm sorry...
<s> None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
<s> Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
<s> I'm not telling you what happened.
<s> Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
<s> This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
<s> You wanna bet?
<s> Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
<s> Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
<s> Epilepsy.
<s> No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
<s> Mueller was alone in the cabin?
<s> Can't do that now, though, can you?
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Yeah...
<s> Just look. Little pocket.
<s> That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
<s> They?
<s> But not the only victim, right?
<s> Stop.
<s> I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
<s> Because I was standing next to him.
<s> Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
<s> I'm not gonna let that happen.
<s> Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
<s> From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
<s> Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> You're drunk --
<s> I'm not even going to dignify that --
<s> For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
<s> You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
<s> Yes.
<s> I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
<s> Best time for banal chit-chat.
<s> So noted.
<s> Got it.
<s> Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
<s> Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
<s> Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
<s> They got their stories straight.
<s> You mean the falsely accused?
<s> Good, just making sure.
<s> Right back where we started.
<s> There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
<s> Want company?
<s> In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
<s> Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
<s> Poor fucker my ass...
<s> Yeah and he doesn't know when --
<s> Oh, you remember now --
<s> Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
<s> Fifty minutes.
<s> What?
<s> Wrong answer --
<s> Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
<s> -- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
<s> Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
<s> No --
<s> It's too neat.
<s> Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> That's great.
<s> Why?
<s> No one's ever left.
<s> I'll go in right now and get that eye.
<s> Fine, I'm doing it.
<s> Don.
<s> Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
<s> My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
<s> A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
<s> I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
<s> Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
<s> I see. I thank you for your time.
<s> Stop.
<s> I like your stories.
<s> I can.
<s> What's your name, Giant?
<s> Beats me.
<s> That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
<s> So how does it happen?
<s> What did he say?
<s> I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
<s> Can we talk?
<s> Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
<s> I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
<s> Like this.
<s> You say...
<s> Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
<s> But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
<s> 'Fraid so.
<s> This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
<s> Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
<s> Probably tonight.
<s> Did you?
<s> Mmm, what?
<s> We rented a car.
<s> You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
<s> Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
<s> Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
<s> Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
<s> There's over eighty thousand here.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Right.
<s> Uh... Yes.
<s> And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
<s> You're asking for my documents?
<s> "I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
<s> John.
<s> I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
<s> He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sorry?
<s> Syevodnya
<s> Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
<s> If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
<s> Okay we won't talk about it.
<s> So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
<s> Sometimes.
<s> You don't have to say anything
<s> Please, there's no... Oh.
<s> It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
<s> Laugh it up.
<s> I'm trying to quit.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Cash.
<s> Yes?
<s> Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
<s> I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
<s> You didn't have to do this.
<s> I need ya help again.
<s> Hey.
<s> No, ma'am.
<s> Yeah. Transmission's shot.
<s> You gonna miss your bus.
<s> Yeah.
<s> She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
<s> That's not right, really, cuz I...
<s> I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
<s> It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
<s> You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
<s> Rose... please...
<s> Let go of my arm...
<s> Careful how you point that gun, boy.
<s> Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
<s> Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
<s> How long... how long I been out?
<s> I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
<s> Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
<s> You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Itches.
<s> You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> Nothin'.
<s> By myself?
<s> Don't think that'd be wise.
<s> I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
<s> Now, hold up.
<s> What'chu sayin'?
<s> Like I told you.
<s> Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
<s> Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
<s> I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
<s> Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
<s> Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
<s> I do.
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> Rae don't do this now...
<s> Hey.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Ronnie...
<s> Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
<s> Home.
<s> So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
<s> Let go...
<s> Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
<s> What?
<s> Hey, when in Rome --
<s> Let's grab some food.
<s> You said that in the last two places.
<s> I hope not.
<s> They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.

<s> You were too far behind.
<s> San is an honorable title.
<s> Big enough.
<s> I can't...
<s> I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
<s> I couldn't tell.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Luck.
<s> Yes...
<s> You have a helluva way of asking for help.
<s> Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
<s> Where's Ich?
<s> I need someone to translate for me.
<s> It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
<s> What do you chant?
<s> What if I chant?
<s> Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
<s> Then take it from him.
<s> Why?
<s> Why me?
<s> Right.
<s> The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
<s> Twenty-four hours, detective.
<s> If anything happens to her while I'm here --
<s> I have to get to Sugai.
<s> I want him.
<s> I'll pay you.
<s> Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
<s> Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
<s> It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
<s> Had in mind something a little more radical.
<s> Why?
<s> If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
<s> Dr. Tyrell?
<s> Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
<s> This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.

<s> Sorry.
<s> I'm taking a piss.
<s> Meaning?
<s> Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
<s> Me too.
<s> Yes?
<s> What did she want?
<s> What's suck night?
<s> Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
<s> You mean the snake.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> It wasn't very good last night, was it?
<s> Hmmm?
<s> Don't be fooled by appearances.
<s> I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
<s> I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.

<s> Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.

<s> I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
<s> I don't have one.

<s> Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
<s> You're all so perfect.
<s> You like it?
<s> I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Oh, brother...
<s> Do ya?
<s> It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
<s> Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
<s> Oh, that's nice.
<s> I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
<s> Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
<s> Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
<s> No.
<s> Why doesn't it never work out?
<s> Sure.
<s> Hey, you know. I was thinking...
<s> No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
<s> Okay.
<s> Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
<s> I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
<s> That's what I was afraid of.
<s> The engine is still running.
<s> You said it would be easy!
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
<s> Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
<s> Well...yeah. Okay.
<s> Do I look crazy?
<s> Good-bye!
<s> And don't be so obvious!
<s> It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
<s> Maybe. But that's how it works.
<s> I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
<s> Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
<s> Well, you had better!!
<s> Sing it to me.
<s> It was at least as good as the sky.
<s> And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
<s> See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes.
<s> Tempus fugit!
<s> Your mom made that all by herself.
<s> Yes, father?! Yes?
<s> I promise. Is that all?
<s> And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
<s> Uh, I think they have.
<s> And it's called...?
<s> Really?  Since when?
<s> Almost all of them.
<s> How 'bout we check with Eve first?
<s> A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
<s> Yeah...Seems to.
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> The sky!!!
<s> Hi.
<s> I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
<s> I'll go up.
<s> I'll be all right.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
<s> Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
<s> No, Calvin, you're favorite.
<s> Right here!
<s> Yes.  Well... yes.
<s> Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
<s> You bet.
<s> --do as I say!
<s> To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
<s> Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
<s> Well, that's blunt!
<s> I think...it...works.
<s> Eve?!
<s> Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
<s> Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
<s> We did not leave together.
<s> He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
<s> Coward!
<s> I know...I know. You did the right thing.
<s> I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
<s> Have him committed.
<s> Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
<s> Roger, Wolf One.
<s> Okay honey.
<s> Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
<s> You did? A human ear?
<s> Yes?
<s> I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
<s> Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
<s> Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
<s> Jeffrey.
<s> Nobody.
<s> I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
<s> You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
<s> Well.
<s> I'll go then.
<s> It's okay. It's okay.
<s> Yes.
<s> You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
<s> Yes, I like you.
<s> What?
<s> Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
<s> That's not crazy. I like you too.
<s> No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
<s> Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Does that scare you?
<s> What if Frank came over here and found us?
<s> If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
<s> I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
<s> Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
<s> He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
<s> He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
<s> It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> Yeah. okay.
<s> Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
<s> I'll get a coat for her.
<s> Looks like you'd make a good runner.
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> It's good to see you, Dad.
<s> Am I bothering you?
<s> There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
<s> Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
<s> Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
<s> Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
<s> Alright. Good luck, yourself.
<s> Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
<s> I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
<s> Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
<s> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
<s> Two.
<s> I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
<s> Oh, okay, can I call?
<s> He got a little jealous.
<s> It's okay. Don't worry about it.
<s> No way. I'm about to blow up.
<s> OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
<s> You want to go talk to him?
<s> Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
<s> Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
<s> Where to?
<s> You look beautiful.
<s> I can't dance fast.
<s> Okay.
<s> No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
<s> No Jeffrey!!
<s> Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
<s> Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
<s> Aye.
<s> Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
<s> What?
<s> This is a six-shooter.
<s> Let's do him right here.
<s> Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
<s> Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
<s> MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
<s> This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
<s> You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
<s> We're here brother.
<s> BLAME...
<s> Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
<s> We paid attention in school.
<s> Aye.
<s> Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
<s> German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
<s> Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
<s> A bit.
<s> Aye.
<s> Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
<s> Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
<s> And he is one smart man.
<s> He's a good man.
<s> And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
<s> Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
<s> Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
<s> Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
<s> How do you figure?
<s> Rocco!
<s> Really want to know?
<s> These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
<s> What?
<s> Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
<s> Twist of lemon!
<s> Eight.
<s> It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
<s> Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
<s> Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
<s> We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
<s> Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
<s> Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
<s> Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
<s> Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
<s> Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
<s> Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
<s> He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
<s> Fuck you Vincenzo.
<s> Yeah, I saw it.
<s> Hang on a second.
<s> Nothing. Go ahead.
<s> No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
<s> You're right. You're right.
<s> Like he would find Dignan. One day.
<s> He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
<s> Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
<s> They obviously weren't designed for racing.
<s> Hi.
<s> Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
<s> What. What's the matter?
<s> We said 48 hours.
<s> He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
<s> Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
<s> Can you hand me those french fries.
<s> What?
<s> I don't think we can do that.
<s> Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
<s> That's not correct.
<s> Ah. Couple days ago.
<s> That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
<s> You really hit a guy with a bottle?
<s> What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
<s> Right now.
<s> Bob!
<s> Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
<s> Did that hurt?
<s> I don't think you will.
<s> As a person?
<s> Take your second position.
<s> Nobody move!
<s> Careful. Check his pulse.
<s> Come on, Kumar.
<s> Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
<s> I'll see you there.
<s> I'm not kidding.
<s> It belongs to Bob's uncle.
<s> Behind Bob's house.
<s> It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
<s> I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
<s> What do you mean?
<s> It feels good.
<s> No. Bob did.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
<s> Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
<s> You think I'm improving?
<s> It was stupid.
<s> Who's got the car keys?
<s> His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
<s> Abdul-Shabazz?
<s> What's he doing here?
<s> You're the faggot.
<s> I thought your parents were in Italy.
<s> Good question.
<s> You're paranoid, Bob.
<s> I warned you, Dignan.
<s> Well, don't blame me. I told you.
<s> That's your domain.
<s> God DAMMIT.
<s> Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
<s> I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
<s> That's good. Keep it at forty.
<s> No. I was calm.
<s> I told you they were there.
<s> You're the one who kept saying ram him.
<s> But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
<s> They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
<s> Come on, Dignan.
<s> I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
<s> Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
<s> I didn't think there was an alarm.
<s> I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
<s> He's damn good.
<s> Well, I think --
<s> Can't get it. It won't... 
<s> Well, I left some money in there.
<s> I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
<s> No, my friend knows her.
<s> Good to know you, John.
<s> Will it track back to us?
<s> What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
<s> Do you know what his budget was?
<s> Did he say anything to you?
<s> I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
<s> No. You lost your way.
<s> Thanks.
<s> And?
<s> It was staged?
<s> Jesus...
<s> It's nothing. It's just a picture.
<s> No, I do.
<s> Then what?
<s> You're a liar.
<s> No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
<s> I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
<s> She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
<s> Conklin.
<s> Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
<s> I did.
<s> I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
<s> No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
<s> We can't wait to be sure.
<s> -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
<s> What?
<s> -- not yet --
<s> What if it's not who you think it is?
<s> Tell me later.
<s> Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
<s> Your first assignment was Geneva.
<s> I was here!
<s> I want to come in.
<s> Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
<s> Careful...
<s> Who's going? Us?
<s> Is there. Is all there.
<s> -- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
<s> Before this? Before Bourne? No.
<s> And why is that?
<s> I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
<s> No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
<s> We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
<s> My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
<s> So let the council swear publicly.
<s> No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
<s> He will. I know he will.
<s> I have ordered conscriptions...
<s> You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
<s> You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
<s> ...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
<s> You mock us with a smile?
<s> Aye.
<s> The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
<s> That depends on the man.
<s> He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
<s> My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
<s> Let her speak.
<s> It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
<s> ...I wouldn't know.
<s> SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
<s> Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
<s> We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
<s> I am trying.
<s> They've tricked us.
<s> No English lord would trust an Irishman!
<s> Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
<s> Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
<s> Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
<s> But you must have something to go on?
<s> The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
<s> Great. I'll see you soon.
<s> Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
<s> I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
<s> Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
<s> No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
<s> What? What could he do?
<s> Fix?
<s> You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
<s> Straight up.
<s> I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
<s> Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
<s> My journals! Where are they?
<s> I thought you were a December baby.
<s> All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
<s> Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
<s> You really don't remember anything that happened?
<s> Wow. That must've taken some courage.
<s> Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
<s> What do you want to know, Evan?
<s> It was a long time ago.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I walk differently?
<s> Why's that?
<s> Different? How?
<s> I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
<s> Which is?
<s> Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
<s> I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
<s> We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
<s> When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
<s> And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
<s> Been there, done that.
<s> Who's to say you can't make things better?
<s> Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
<s> I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
<s> Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
<s> Thumper had a busy afternoon.
<s> Y... yes. I guess I did.
<s> Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
<s> If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
<s> Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
<s> Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
<s> I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
<s> I come from a big family.
<s> Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
<s> You're such a retard!
<s> Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
<s> Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
<s> I'm sorry. It is.
<s> In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
<s> No thanks, Carl.
<s> How long can I afford to stay closed?
<s> Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Er, good luck, yes.
<s> Suppose we do.
<s> You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
<s> It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
<s> And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
<s> Well, so long.
<s> -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
<s> Good day.
<s> This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
<s> What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
<s> In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
<s> Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
<s> Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
<s> Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
<s> Yes.
<s> The stairs from the street.
<s> Richard, I had to see you.
<s> You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
<s> -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
<s> What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
<s> All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
<s> Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
<s> Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
<s> If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
<s> Won't you join us?
<s> I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
<s> Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
<s> To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
<s> Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
<s> I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
<s> Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
<s> You're saying this only to make me go.
<s> And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
<s> What for?
<s> What of it?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes, rather.
<s> Yes.
<s> Very well.
<s> Thank you.
<s> -- Thank you.
<s> Are you quite finished with us?
<s> Good day.
<s> Good evening, Captain.
<s> My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
<s> But everybody's having such a good time.
<s> Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
<s> Why? What's in Lisbon?
<s> And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
<s> Our entertainment is enough.
<s> I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
<s> It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
<s> Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
<s> Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
<s> Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
<s> Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
<s> You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
<s> It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
<s> You think of everything, don't you?
<s> Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
<s> Our expenses?
<s> -- Sacha, call a cab.
<s> What is your nationality?
<s> Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
<s> I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
<s> I don't want them here overnight.
<s> Then don't have a drink.
<s> No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
<s> Do too much, I'll die.
<s> Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
<s> But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
<s> Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
<s> I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
<s> Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
<s> Possible.  So you did those wings?
<s> Well, not really, I --
<s> Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
<s> I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
<s> I had it on the island with me.
<s> Let's take a look.
<s> Cold.
<s> Let me guess, Russia came up?
<s> He's your cute thing.
<s> We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
<s> It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
<s> Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
<s> A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
<s> Hey...hey...it's okay!
<s> You have any children?
<s> Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I don't know.  I really don't know.
<s> It means a lot...that you came.
<s> The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
<s> And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
<s> You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That new roof, that's your doing.
<s> There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
<s> Can you find her?
<s> Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
<s> The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
<s> It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
<s> Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
<s> You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
<s> We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
<s> Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
<s> We're on.
<s> Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
<s> You should have smelled me.
<s> Time I had lots of.
<s> To life.
<s> Believe me I know.
<s> Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
<s> Deep, real deep.
<s> I need to do it.
<s> Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
<s> They just want you to hire some new help.
<s> Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
<s> It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
<s> Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
<s> I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
<s> You cook very well!
<s> She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
<s> If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
<s> He mentions Homer, too, you know.
<s> He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
<s> I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
<s> She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
<s> It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
<s> I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
<s> I never *asked* for any responsibility.
<s> Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
<s> You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
<s> We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
<s> So we should "wait and see." For how long?
<s> We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
<s> You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
<s> No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
<s> Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
<s> I never said they were boring.
<s> I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
<s> I know what you've been doing.
<s> *Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
<s> He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
<s> She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
<s> Someone not from Maine.
<s> Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
<s> I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
<s> Actually, I volunteered.
<s> Oh, I would love that, Wally.
<s> Migrants?
<s> You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
<s> And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
<s> Yes, for both.
<s> All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
<s> Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
<s> Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
<s> It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
<s> It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
<s> Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
<s> I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
<s> Right.
<s> I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
<s> You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
<s> You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
<s> *No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
<s> They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
<s> Mind your own business, Peaches.
<s> They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
<s> That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
<s> That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
<s> You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
<s> No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
<s> Sort of like a letter of intent.
<s> And you have this letter of intent?
<s> You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
<s> What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
<s> Today? Started off great...
<s> Mob?
<s> You're pissed we didn't get credit?
<s> Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
<s> So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
<s> Let's go, Jake?
<s> Well, this is just fucking great...
<s> And what about Big Al?
<s> Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
<s> Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
<s> So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
<s> That's it.
<s> What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
<s> I can't do that.
<s> Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
<s> No. Just confidence.
<s> I think two million.
<s> No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
<s> You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
<s> Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
<s> Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
<s> Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
<s> Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
<s> Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
<s> What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
<s> Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
<s> Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
<s> Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
<s> Intuition.
<s> WHAT?
<s> I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
<s> You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
<s> No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
<s> No, I want my cut!
<s> Then shut up.
<s> You sure we're clear?
<s> You better get over to Al's. Now.
<s> Miles...
<s> Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
<s> How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
<s> Wait a second... Who's the mope?
<s> Where the hell is she?
<s> But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
<s> What?
<s> In over your head?
<s> Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
<s> I try.
<s> He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
<s> Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Whaddya mean? We got dick.
<s> I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
<s> That's what I'm talking about.
<s> No. Thanks.
<s> All men are cheats.
<s> Sorry.
<s> I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
<s> Seven-fifty.
<s> What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
<s> I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
<s> I'll try and make it.
<s> Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
<s> She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
<s> I've got something to tell you.
<s> 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
<s> You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
<s> Fine.
<s> I'll see you in my dreams.
<s> Why not?
<s> Marion. It's a book.
<s> Leave it.
<s> Then what?
<s> Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
<s> All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
<s> Well, thank you anyway.
<s> So why did you come to my casino?
<s> I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
<s> Your father?
<s> Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
<s> That's fine.
<s> Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
<s> It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
<s> Then you're not a pro.
<s> What kind of trouble?
<s> I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
<s> Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
<s> I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
<s> I can't do it, Jani.
<s> Do you?
<s> The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
<s> Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
<s> Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
<s> Who...
<s> Have I?
<s> Too much. Eighteen hundred.
<s> Over the river.
<s> Thanks.
<s> How long have you worked at the casino?
<s> Good call. Help yourself.
<s> That bitch? No.
<s> No thanks.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> Rough life, Jack.
<s> Jack.
<s> We check every four days.
<s> They've been tested.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> No.
<s> Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
<s> Does he win?
<s> Bruised.
<s> Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
<s> Key? Key? What is the key?
<s> Key?
<s> Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
<s> Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
<s> Huh?
<s> Bomb?
<s> I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> Right!
<s> Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
<s> To explode, of course.
<s> That is correct.
<s> I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
<s> I'll check it.
<s> Yes, Doolittle.
<s> Doolittle...
<s> Which one?
<s> Any planets?
<s> Who cares. Don't bother me.
<s> Fred.
<s> -- Remark.
<s> I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
<s> I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
<s> Yes, Talby, what is it?
<s> Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
<s> It didn't work?
<s> Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
<s> Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I like to keep it professional, that's all.
<s> You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
<s> What the hell are you doing?
<s> Leave.  Now.
<s> Where?
<s> You mean until you showed up?
<s> And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
<s> No way.
<s> I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
<s> I ain't mad at you...
<s> It's a rule.
<s> They took my daughter.
<s> But why can't we stay here?
<s> Are we in some kind of trouble?
<s> First time I ever heard that.
<s> The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
<s> Wasn't that hard.
<s> It was open.
<s> Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
<s> Bent?
<s> You did go through my stuff.
<s> Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
<s> She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
<s> On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
<s> Open it.
<s> Look, thank you for this but--
<s> Zack... He made it... He's alive...
<s> Ladies would be elsewhere.
<s> I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
<s> Oh?
<s> Let go of my hand.
<s> I understand.
<s> My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
<s> Nothing on Hannah?
<s> I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
<s> You and me both.
<s> Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
<s> You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
<s> Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
<s> Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
<s> And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
<s> Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
<s> She's gonna want to hear for herself.
<s> We gotta talk.
<s> Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
<s> How'd you get her out of town?
<s> Easy Sketchy.
<s> You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
<s> I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
<s> I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
<s> Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
<s> Hawk.
<s> Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
<s> Right, slow...
<s> Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
<s> What? That's disgusting!
<s> Whatever... stella.
<s> Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
<s> Plenty, but it was all bad.
<s> YO, DOOFUS!
<s> And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
<s> Tickets?
<s> Oh, yeah...?
<s> Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
<s> What's gone?
<s> Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
<s> Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
<s> Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
<s> Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
<s> Uhh... nothing.
<s> Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
<s> You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
<s> Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
<s> Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
<s> Let's lift up her shirt.
<s> Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
<s> Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
<s> It's not nearly enough, punk.
<s> Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
<s> Good morning...
<s> So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
<s> So... that's it?
<s> Donnie! Give it back!
<s> It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
<s> You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
<s> We went to a hotel.
<s> Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
<s> Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
<s> Why is that?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I'm going home.
<s> Who?
<s> What's wrong with you?
<s> There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
<s> The Lifeline is divided that way.
<s> We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
<s> Grandma Death.
<s> A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
<s> A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
<s> Would you like to talk about this friend?
<s> Frank.
<s> How so?
<s> No.  That's stupid.
<s> Yes.
<s> I think about girls a lot.
<s> I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
<s> I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
<s> It reminded me of my dog Callie.
<s> Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
<s> I... I was playing with fire.
<s> But you were punished.
<s> What did you want for Christmas that year?
<s> How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
<s> Why?
<s> Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
<s> Soon. Time is almost up.
<s> What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
<s> Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
<s> Excuse me? What's your name, son?
<s> I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
<s> Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
<s> Donnie? You're a dick.
<s> Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
<s> This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
<s> You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
<s> She's right over there.
<s> Yeah, you betcha...
<s> I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
<s> Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
<s> Yah?
<s> Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
<s> Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
<s> Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
<s> I love you much.
<s> Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
<s> I know.
<s> Yah-sure, fine... fine.
<s> Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
<s> Okay. Take her purse.
<s> It smells funny. Like gasoline.
<s> Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
<s> "Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
<s> Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
<s> Gladys! Stop it!
<s> Nothin' too showy!
<s> Uh, Gladys?
<s> What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
<s> "My President"...
<s> I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
<s> About - thirty-four seconds.
<s> Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
<s> I wanna powder my nose...
<s> He's half poodle and half watch dog -
<s> Yeh, he's only got one eye.
<s> I don't call him, I whistle.
<s> Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
<s> I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
<s> By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
<s> Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
<s> That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
<s> We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
<s> Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
<s> That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
<s> Sure.
<s> I can't do it right away.
<s> Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
<s> You upstart!
<s> Yes.
<s> Bah!! 
<s> I don't remember.
<s> I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
<s> These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
<s> Well no -- not exactly -- but --
<s> This is terrible!
<s> My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
<s> I thought everything was working out fine.
<s> Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
<s> How lovely.
<s> Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
<s> He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
<s> And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
<s> Did you see it?
<s> What is it?
<s> He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
<s> I intend to.
<s> Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
<s> You don't own this man!
<s> It's quite nutritious, sir.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
<s> Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
<s> Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
<s> No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
<s> Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
<s> I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
<s> Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
<s> Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
<s> Yes.
<s> You've never been?
<s> I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh no, my friend...
<s> Thank you... very much.
<s> Yes John!
<s> That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
<s> Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
<s> Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
<s> You did not ask me.
<s> Of course! What did you think?
<s> I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
<s> Your mother?
<s> Good morning.
<s> Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
<s> Yes, John.
<s> There is one more thing, John. Here.
<s> Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
<s> Yes! The workhouse!
<s> Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
<s> Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
<s> You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
<s> When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
<s> Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
<s> There IS no one.
<s> But, Father, it IS!
<s> These? What are THESE? They're swords.
<s> Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
<s> What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
<s> And the week before that?
<s> But, Erik...
<s> I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
<s> I'm sure it's lovely.
<s> Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
<s> You've got to let me go!
<s> They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
<s> Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
<s> And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
<s> What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
<s> Well... no...
<s> But...
<s> Come on, move it!
<s> You may need a real Berserk.
<s> ROW!
<s> What "magic"?
<s> But you're the Gods!
<s> Now stop it!
<s> To the oars!
<s> Oh... er... yes...
<s> Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
<s> I will join my grandfather there.
<s> I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
<s> It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
<s> We haven't got a spare place.
<s> Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
<s> I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
<s> Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
<s> Your lord.
<s> That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
<s> Mum! Dad!
<s> It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
<s> The Age of Ragnarok ends...
<s> Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
<s> You can't let Erik do THAT.
<s> Help!
<s> No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
<s> By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
<s> You went berserk...
<s> Helpless...
<s> Easy, Dad!
<s> Neither am I.
<s> Say hi to Naomi.
<s> But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
<s> I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
<s> You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
<s> I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
<s> Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
<s> Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
<s> Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
<s> Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
<s> I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
<s> Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
<s> I'm Joel.
<s> I don't know any jokes about your name.
<s> I'm not nuts.
<s> See, I wouldn't think that about you.
<s> Yes?
<s> It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
<s> Probably see you at the book store.
<s> No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
<s> You're not a stalker or anything, right?
<s> You know Wilmont?
<s> Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
<s> Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> You pick it.
<s> I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No.
<s> No, not at all.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> It's three.
<s> You're not ready.
<s> No.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
<s> What was I wearing?
<s> But you weren't. I could tell.
<s> So what. Infatuation is good, too.
<s> Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
<s> Hi.
<s> I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
<s> Yeah, like that.
<s> Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
<s> I don't think I've slept in a year.
<s> I love her.
<s> Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
<s> I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Make love?
<s> Oh, um...
<s> Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
<s> I just walked in.
<s> Oddly enough, I do.
<s> God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
<s> Long day thinking.
<s> I'm like a joke to them.
<s> Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
<s> Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
<s> On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
<s> You have to stop this!
<s> Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
<s> I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
<s> I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
<s> You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
<s> It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
<s> I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
<s> We'll speak soon.
<s> You found us okay?
<s> This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
<s> Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
<s> Cole slaw, ice tea?
<s> Welcome, Howard.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Is that Nietzsche?
<s> Alexander Pope?
<s> Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
<s> No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
<s> We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
<s> It was a mutual decision.
<s> The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
<s> Yeah, probably a good idea.
<s> Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
<s> Then check the connections.
<s> She likes you okay.
<s> This one's history. Moving on...
<s> Jesus, Patrick!
<s> It's a quote book.
<s> Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
<s> The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
<s> Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
<s> Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
<s> Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
<s> You don't agree with Debbie, then?
<s> Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
<s> I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
<s> American Cheese. The king of road food.
<s> I was a successful model once.
<s> I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
<s> I'm the best.
<s> When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
<s> Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
<s> What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
<s> Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
<s> Hold on, Coop...
<s> I'll get him.
<s> You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
<s> I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
<s> I don't know, the screens are dead...!
<s> Run!
<s> Pressure?
<s> It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
<s> The dark inside me.
<s> How do you know all this?
<s> That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
<s> You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
<s> Justin. I won't let you die.
<s> Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
<s> So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
<s> I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
<s> What you got, Peters?
<s> Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
<s> They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
<s> "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
<s> If it worked, yes.
<s> The date.
<s> The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
<s> Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
<s> Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
<s> You can't, your orders are specific...
<s> Son of a bitch!
<s> Then who the fuck are you?
<s> You know.
<s> I'm not the Devil.
<s> Something like that, yeah.
<s> Where is it?
<s> Starck...
<s> Love to.
<s> We don't have time to fart.
<s> I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
<s> Come again, Skipper?
<s> Justin?
<s> Keep your eyes open.
<s> Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
<s> "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
<s> I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
<s> You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
<s> Five seconds.
<s> Blow it up?
<s> He's been past Mars?
<s> They're explosive charges.
<s> You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
<s> I did.
<s> She's not ugly.
<s> That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
<s> Picking up magnetic interference.
<s> Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
<s> Do they have pressure?
<s> Oh, he did.
<s> Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
<s> What is this? Where's Reed?
<s> Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
<s> We got what we wanted. That's enough.
<s> I'm sure he's matured since then.
<s> Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
<s> Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
<s> 'Course not. Strictly business.
<s> So are you!
<s> I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
<s> Stay right. Left is trouble.
<s> Ben, are you there?
<s> Oh, it is.
<s> But all these people...
<s> Okay, "mom."
<s> Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
<s> Girl...?!
<s> Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
<s> No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
<s> Never better.
<s> I was talking about us. Working together.
<s> What...?  Oh.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
<s> Of course. Of course.
<s> You need a doctor.
<s> I'm sure I can come up with something.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
<s> It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<s> I understand the business reasons.
<s> Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
<s> Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
<s> Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
<s> Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
<s> Oh, I think you already have.
<s> I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
<s> Totally.
<s> I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
<s> Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
<s> I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
<s> Manager!!
<s> Your friends use the pool too.
<s> They're not home yet.
<s> Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
<s> I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
<s> Why?
<s> See you later.
<s> Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> Sure. Come on in.
<s> I don't know.
<s> All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
<s> No.
<s> Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
<s> You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
<s> Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
<s> Yeah?
<s> All right. Pay attention.
<s> Damone! You come here?
<s> Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
<s> Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
<s> Yes.
<s> How often do you go?
<s> Totally.
<s> All right.
<s> Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
<s> Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
<s> I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
<s> Really?
<s> It was okay.
<s> Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
<s> Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
<s> I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
<s> No.
<s> I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
<s> It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
<s> I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
<s> That little prick.
<s> That little prick.
<s> What do you want?
<s> There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
<s> Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
<s> And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
<s> Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
<s> No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
<s> It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
<s> Two more Cokes.
<s> Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
<s> Do you want to come inside?
<s> No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
<s> Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
<s> Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
<s> Do you really have to go?
<s> I'll get you the notes.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Awake? What do you mean?
<s> Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
<s> Righto!
<s> Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
<s> Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
<s> You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
<s> Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
<s> Really?
<s> I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
<s> Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
<s> No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
<s> Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
<s> You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
<s> Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
<s> Why what?
<s> Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
<s> Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
<s> Not much. Why?
<s> That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
<s> Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
<s> How about a check?
<s> Plans?
<s> Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
<s> She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
<s> In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
<s> You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
<s> We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
<s> You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
<s> Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
<s> I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
<s> How much is the lemon meringue pie?
<s> YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
<s> Nobody. I'm the maid!
<s> I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
<s> No! I swear I'm not!
<s> Of course, officer.
<s> Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
<s> A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
<s> How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
<s> Part of what?
<s> Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
<s> Spare me.
<s> We can't risk letting them in.
<s> Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
<s> I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
<s> Her fella.
<s> With what just happened upstairs --
<s> Gonna stay for a couple?
<s> Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
<s> Hey!
<s> Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
<s> Fuck you too.
<s> No. You?
<s> Just an observation.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> He's dead.
<s> Oh.
<s> Magic potion.  You should try a little.
<s> It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
<s> Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
<s> He shot you the other time.
<s> What?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Fully.
<s> Two.
<s> Holds four.
<s> Seven.
<s> What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
<s> You smell like ass!
<s> If he doesn't shut up...
<s> Amazing you made it this far.
<s> Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
<s> Nothing, just lookin'.
<s> She's not very nice, is she?
<s> That's fine.
<s> Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
<s> So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
<s> I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
<s> I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
<s> Thank you --
<s> I'd like nothing better.
<s> My clothes?
<s> It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
<s> I'm not!
<s> I'm not!
<s> Huh.
<s> I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
<s> What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
<s> Right now we have to be practical.
<s> ...Yes.
<s> What night?
<s> I gotta go now.
<s> All square, Doc.
<s> Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
<s> No. Never.
<s> Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
<s> I didn't have much to do with it.
<s> I know.
<s> You really want to go?
<s> I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
<s> Always. Always.
<s> I don't care, Dad. I love you.
<s> No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
<s> You can always come see it in London.
<s> I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
<s> They'll mend.
<s> Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
<s> Not me. But other people seem to.
<s> Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
<s> You think I'd miss it?
<s> I just wanted to see how you looked.
<s> Enh.
<s> I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
<s> Quietly.
<s> ...So you think I should go.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
<s> Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
<s> If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
<s> I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
<s> It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
<s> Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
<s> I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
<s> What?
<s> That's right.
<s> I guess.
<s> What's that?
<s> Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
<s> ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
<s> I love you too, Frances.
<s> Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
<s> No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
<s> Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> No.
<s> Just a little way.
<s> Yes.
<s> Run!
<s> I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
<s> Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
<s> 'Golden Boy.'
<s> Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
<s> Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
<s> Smile, little sister, smile.
<s> Mama, what's...
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Not long.
<s> Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
<s> Mama...?
<s> You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
<s> It ain't for lack of trying.
<s> Please sit down...
<s> I see.
<s> Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
<s> 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
<s> What?
<s> Then why weep for him?
<s> Better that way... for me.
<s> I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
<s> How did you find me?
<s> I see it before me.
<s> A brain. Extremities.
<s> And you look so lovely.
<s> He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
<s> Fine.
<s> Nothing can. Not ever.
<s> He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
<s> He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
<s> Quite a send-off, isn't it?
<s> To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
<s> Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
<s> Your decision. For us.
<s> If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
<s> It is
<s> Now husband and wife.
<s> Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
<s> Oh God.
<s> These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
<s> Somebody has to!
<s> It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
<s> Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
<s> And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
<s> So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
<s> Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
<s> Victor, explain yourself.
<s> You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
<s> It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
<s> Who are you?
<s> No, no, they're all dead...
<s> Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
<s> You okay?
<s> I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
<s> Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
<s> Not if they're where I think they are.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Wet. I don't know.
<s> I meant everything.
<s> I can't, Barry...
<s> Oh, you...
<s> Here we go.
<s> I'll spot you five points.
<s> I don't believe you...
<s> We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
<s> Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
<s> Whassamatta?
<s> Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
<s> That's thirty percent.
<s> I meant me, my son and my daughter.
<s> I said new, this is an '90.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
<s> Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
<s> What's this about, money?
<s> My wife.
<s> In heaven.
<s> Yes, they do.
<s> I was a minister.
<s> I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
<s> Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
<s> Pass.
<s> No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
<s> I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
<s> I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
<s> What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
<s> You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
<s> Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
<s> If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
<s> No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
<s> You asked me if I would --
<s> Me too.
<s> Later.
<s> Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
<s> I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
<s> This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
<s> You believe me don't cha?
<s> They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
<s> Feels good.
<s> That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
<s> Sight seein'.
<s> Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
<s> Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
<s> What?
<s> That's what you look like.
<s> Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
<s> Scarred for life, that's how I am!
<s> Yeah, it's mine.
<s> Who's "we"?
<s> Standing right here in my office.
<s> I'm fine, sir.
<s> If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
<s> It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
<s> Pardon?
<s> You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
<s> I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
<s> Smoke her.
<s> Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
<s> Sounds familiar.
<s> You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
<s> Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
<s> It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
<s> Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
<s> Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
<s> If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
<s> She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
<s> Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
<s> You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
<s> I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
<s> Blank faces here, O'Neil.
<s> Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
<s> Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
<s> I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
<s> Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
<s> Jordan.  You watch your ass.
<s> Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
<s> I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
<s> Yeah.  Me too.
<s> Whose orders were those?
<s> I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
<s> Thanks, Wick.
<s> Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
<s> That's a good story.
<s> Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
<s> Just askin'
<s> I don't know...
<s> It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
<s> "Dad."
<s> Dick, Jane, and Spot.
<s> No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
<s> We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
<s> North?
<s> The first female President?
<s> Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
<s> What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
<s> No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
<s> I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
<s> Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
<s> Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
<s> I got pretty close.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
<s> I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Really? I'd like to find out.
<s> Speak of the devil.
<s> That's the problem. He did.
<s> Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
<s> Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
<s> What do I get?
<s> He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
<s> Not now. You got my bag?
<s> Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
<s> Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
<s> They are with me!
<s> It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
<s> Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
<s> But you don't know for sure!
<s> Last time you didn't even scratch it!
<s> Why do you need that?
<s> Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
<s> So you're in?
<s> Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
<s> You were right.
<s> It's okay. I know her.
<s> It's Raymond.
<s> Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
<s> Is that the bathroom?
<s> Quellek. What are you doing in there?
<s> Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
<s> I won't and nothing you say-
<s> Like YOU know?
<s> Must be some sort of mining facility.
<s> You go first! There's no time!
<s> That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
<s> I had the shot...
<s> Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
<s> No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
<s> You think you could do better "Laredo?"
<s> ...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
<s> You could order something in.
<s> The ships are gaining...
<s> Nobody was WATCHING?
<s> He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
<s> You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
<s> It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
<s> It's okay. Listen-
<s> Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
<s> Okay...  Okay, now what.
<s> Lt. Madison, GO.
<s> Yes?
<s> No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
<s> Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
<s> Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
<s> Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
<s> Yeah, what is it?
<s> Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
<s> A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
<s> No. Keep all energy to the armor.
<s> We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
<s> One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
<s> On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
<s> We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
<s> Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
<s> JASON...
<s> I don't think that's a cloud...
<s> Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
<s> Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
<s> Why does this sound so familiar?
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> Wait... Jason, Here!...
<s> I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
<s> Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
<s> You have ten seconds.
<s> Stop, please! I don't know!
<s> Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
<s> Thanks
<s> It's perfectly safe. I promise.
<s> Our former Commander was not... Strong.
<s> I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
<s> You what?.. What are you talking about?
<s> But...Why?
<s> I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
<s> Why don't you just turn it on and see?
<s> Oh god...
<s> Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
<s> It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
<s> We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
<s> Get oacK on their tail.
<s> Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
<s> Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
<s> Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
<s> It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
<s> The army can survive without me.
<s> Same old story.
<s> Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
<s> None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
<s> I ain't forgot about the freedom.
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
<s> Lafayette will not be happy...
<s> I'll be twenty next year, sir.
<s> We better, Congress invented him.
<s> Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
<s> To hell with Arnold...
<s> March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
<s> Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
<s> Who's in command out there?
<s> George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
<s> As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
<s> Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
<s> These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
<s> What's the difference?
<s> To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
<s> The man is a traitor!
<s> Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
<s> What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
<s> Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
<s> I rode here, on my horse.
<s> General Lee, sir!
<s> But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
<s> Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
<s> When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
<s> Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
<s> Martha!  For God's sake!
<s> You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
<s> You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
<s> That's a lie!
<s> George, I'm sorry.
<s> Africa, of course.
<s> That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
<s> The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
<s> Well, we must be who we must be...
<s> Let's get you darker!
<s> Just because they are born?
<s> Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
<s> Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
<s> Farrah. Come here.
<s> I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
<s> Calm down, Bear...
<s> Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
<s> Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
<s> Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
<s> I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
<s> What about her?
<s> With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
<s> There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
<s> That's all.
<s> Tell you what...
<s> I'll find it.
<s> First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
<s> You serious?
<s> That's the magic number.
<s> What I been wondering is where's he been.
<s> Depends. Who's this?
<s> Who?
<s> That's correct. Look at me.
<s> Whatever you want, Ray.
<s> I'm in the movie business.
<s> What've you got?
<s> We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
<s> Harry, lemme give you some advice.
<s> I know what a marker is.
<s> A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
<s> So what's the problem?
<s> But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
<s> Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
<s> Let's see how we get along.
<s> I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
<s> You have it?
<s> Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
<s> If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
<s> Like this?
<s> That's right. Three percent.
<s> "Cotton".
<s> He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
<s> I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
<s> Sounds fair.
<s> Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
<s> How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
<s> Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
<s> What happened?
<s> Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
<s> Are you going down?
<s> That's what the guy said.
<s> That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
<s> Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
<s> I'm going into the movie business.
<s> Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
<s> Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
<s> Murray's dead.
<s> He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
<s> He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
<s> That's where you got the idea?
<s> 'We?'
<s> Shylock?
<s> Hello, Martin.
<s> I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
<s> What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
<s> Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
<s> With that coxswain dickhead.
<s> Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
<s> Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
<s> Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
<s> Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
<s> Bring it on, dude.
<s> Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
<s> I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
<s> Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
<s> Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
<s> It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
<s> So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
<s> Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
<s> Right.
<s> Murphy.
<s> What do you propose?
<s> You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
<s> Right.
<s> Right.
<s> You're a pal.
<s> Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
<s> Nothing. Let's get outa here.
<s> So what did happen?
<s> For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
<s> There's somebody else on this boat.
<s> We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
<s> Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
<s> I don't know, are we?
<s> I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
<s> Victims of what?
<s> Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
<s> Maybe it was more than that.
<s> We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
<s> You got that right.
<s> Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
<s> There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
<s> Looks like it's adrift.
<s> Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
<s> You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
<s> Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
<s> We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
<s> Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
<s> We could call for help.
<s> And look what happened.
<s> We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
<s> The mooring hasn't come taught.
<s> So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
<s> Leave it.
<s> You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
<s> You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
<s> It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
<s> Not the Maxine?
<s> Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
<s> Yeah, I heard about that.
<s> I just buzzed him in.
<s> Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
<s> It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
<s> I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
<s> As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
<s> So what do you think?
<s> Huh?
<s> Jesus...
<s> Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
<s> Why?
<s> Then why do you hate me so much?
<s> That's just the way I am!
<s> It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
<s> Because if you do, I'll kill you!
<s> It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
<s> I know, she needs to die immediately.
<s> How perfect.
<s> Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
<s> God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
<s> Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
<s> That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
<s> I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
<s> It's still twenty-five minutes early.
<s> She says she wants to MMPH!
<s> What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
<s> I can't believe it!
<s> Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
<s> Totally! Look!
<s> Gross!
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> Somewhere downtown.
<s> As always.
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
<s> No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
<s> Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
<s> I dunno, but next week is my last class...
<s> What thing?
<s> Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
<s> So should I come over?
<s> I said "great"...
<s> Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
<s> Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
<s> I need to talk to you.
<s> Actually, he's a really nice guy.
<s> Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
<s> It's kind of falling apart.
<s> That's not even --
<s> That tape sucked, by the way!
<s> Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
<s> What?
<s> Well why do I care about that?
<s> Indian records?
<s> Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
<s> I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
<s> Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
<s> I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
<s> Jesus!
<s> I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
<s> Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
<s> Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
<s> We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
<s> Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
<s> I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
<s> Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
<s> Hooray for me.
<s> It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
<s> What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
<s> Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
<s> No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
<s> What? Why?
<s> I won't even dignify that with a response.
<s> Hi, it's me...
<s> Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
<s> What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
<s> So, do you like me, Seymour?
<s> Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
<s> I had to see you.
<s> What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
<s> ...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
<s> I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
<s> I dunno, I...
<s> ...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
<s> They're Seymour's.
<s> I wish I could see him.
<s> I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
<s> Right, exactly!
<s> What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
<s> I don't know... where is she, then?
<s> Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
<s> Why? What did she tell you?
<s> What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
<s> Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
<s> Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
<s> So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
<s> Why don't we start with that next week?
<s> -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
<s> How; we don't know where they are?
<s> I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
<s> Starling?
<s> -what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
<s> Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
<s> -not a time for modesty, Bob-
<s> You never had it.
<s> That is correct.  Nothing.
<s> Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
<s> -true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
<s> Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
<s> -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
<s> No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
<s> Has it ever done that before?
<s> Don't they have to be?...
<s> I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
<s> Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
<s> Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
<s> Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
<s> It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
<s> I don't believe you had a mother. 
<s> Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
<s> Some mysteries should not have solutions.
<s> Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
<s> I won't.
<s> I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
<s> Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
<s> You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
<s> There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
<s> Oscar!  You poor kid!
<s> I'll supervise.
<s> I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
<s> Oh, hello, Peter.
<s> I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
<s> No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
<s> I don't know what to do anymore.
<s> How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
<s> It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
<s> No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
<s> Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
<s> No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
<s> Oh, sure, that sounds great.
<s> Okay.
<s> Too bad for the Moldavians.
<s> I await the word of Vigo.
<s> Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
<s> Yes.
<s> Did I forget something?
<s> You were the one who got me in.
<s> Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
<s> I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
<s> I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
<s> No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
<s> You need the exercise.
<s> A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
<s> Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
<s> Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
<s> Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
<s> His nickname is "The Hammer."
<s> You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
<s> And it's all flowing toward the museum.
<s> Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
<s> It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
<s> If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
<s> It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
<s> We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
<s> I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
<s> Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
<s> Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
<s> Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
<s> I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
<s> And decent.
<s> Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
<s> Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
<s> What?
<s> That's it.  Get out.
<s> I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
<s> There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
<s> Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
<s> Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
<s> Print is dead.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Here are tonight's calls.
<s> Has this ever happened before?
<s> You could say that.
<s> In a storage facility.
<s> Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
<s> That's "Peck!"
<s> They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
<s> I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
<s> Why not?
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> Full-stream with strogon pulse.
<s> We'd better adjust our streams.
<s> God, it's ugly!
<s> Looked at with your eyes.
<s> Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
<s> But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
<s> Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
<s> Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
<s> He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
<s> Right.  We'll believe anything.
<s> If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
<s> Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
<s> Why not do it in the Colosseum?
<s> You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
<s> Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
<s> The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> That's difficult to say, general.
<s> You flatter me, Caesar.
<s> If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
<s> We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
<s> Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
<s> He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
<s> I'll nose around...
<s> But have never been?
<s> Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
<s> They can't... if this is Rome...
<s> Sneaking around with your brother?
<s> Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
<s> Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
<s> I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
<s> He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
<s> Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
<s> They fear me.
<s> I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
<s> Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> Well, we can try...
<s> You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
<s> Let him trust Quintus.
<s> I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
<s> I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
<s> What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
<s> Alive... I'm alive...
<s> So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
<s> As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
<s> I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
<s> No.
<s> This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
<s> It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
<s> Yes.
<s> During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
<s> You sure you really want to?
<s> You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
<s> Because I want to know what's happening.
<s> Get out of here.
<s> At the Zoo.
<s> Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
<s> Here he comes.
<s> Because -- I am.
<s> What did she say?
<s> My belt.
<s> No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> But Elaine --
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes.
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> Why wouldn't it?
<s> Carl who?
<s> There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
<s> I have to go now. I'm sorry.
<s> Could you bring it up?
<s> -- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
<s> Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
<s> No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
<s> Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
<s> No.
<s> Is what a girl?
<s> Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
<s> What do you drink?
<s> Look -- I think I should be going --
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
<s> We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
<s> We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
<s> Benjamin?
<s> No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
<s> Right.
<s> Don't you think he trusts us together?
<s> Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
<s> Yes. Yes. Let me out!
<s> I haven't. No.
<s> Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
<s> Now?
<s> Well -- do you want to go up first?
<s> Benjamin.
<s> I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
<s> What?
<s> This is all terribly wrong.
<s> Who said it was my first time?
<s> Are you tired of it?
<s> There's no risk?
<s> What?
<s> Calm down, Benjamin.
<s> No.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Is it?
<s> Don't tell Elaine.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
<s> Don't talk about Elaine?
<s> There's nothing to tell.
<s> Don't start acting hurt.
<s> Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
<s> Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
<s> But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
<s> Then you'd better start believing me.
<s> I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
<s> Sir?
<s> Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
<s> When I go off?
<s> What else?
<s> Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
<s> No.
<s> About an hour ago.
<s> We haven't.
<s> About what?
<s> That has nothing to do with it --
<s> No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
<s> Swell. I appreciate it.
<s> Oh no.
<s> I've got to go.
<s> No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
<s> Ben -- how old are you now?
<s> How long have we known each other now?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
<s> Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
<s> Don't shout at me, Ben.
<s> Benjamin Braddock.
<s> Yes, I can.
<s> Dad -- can you listen --
<s> No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
<s> Not now.
<s> Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
<s> Who?
<s> Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
<s> Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
<s> You're very funny --
<s> Of course.
<s> Would you like to make a man happy?
<s> Yes -- oh!
<s> No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
<s> I should like to smoke.
<s> I want to be alone.
<s> I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
<s> I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
<s> I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
<s> Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
<s> Oh -- 
<s> I know.
<s> Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
<s> Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
<s> I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
<s> Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
<s> A little strange, Baron.
<s> No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
<s> No -- not at all.
<s> You've lost everything?
<s> All of that at once, Baron?
<s> I thought she was splendid!
<s> If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
<s> No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
<s> The war dropped him here and forgot him.
<s> I must have made a mistake.
<s> Don't do that. 
<s> No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
<s> Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
<s> No, Doctor.
<s> I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
<s> Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
<s> I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
<s> Stay where you are.
<s> No.
<s> Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
<s> Yes.
<s> I never danced before -- in public.
<s> Oh -- what -- what -- 
<s> Yes --
<s> Oh yes, of course.
<s> Moreover --
<s> Moreover...
<s> Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
<s> What?
<s> Can't you understand me?
<s> Hello!
<s> Well -- you want me?
<s> Well?
<s> Well?
<s> I understand perfectly.
<s> You mean Baron von Gaigern?
<s> Well, he's a gentleman!
<s> You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
<s> Exactly.
<s> They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
<s> All you have to do is phone for it.
<s> Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
<s> You've decided against the merger?
<s> Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
<s> In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
<s> But, Madam. cannot do that.
<s> Send it away -- I shan't need it.
<s> Good morning, Madam.
<s> Oh, yes, Suzette.
<s> Goodnight, Suzette.
<s> Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
<s> But when did he go? How do you know?
<s> Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
<s> Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
<s> I could not think of not accepting.
<s> An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
<s> Me?
<s> He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
<s> -- We must do something...
<s> No news yet?
<s> I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
<s> You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
<s> Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
<s> I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
<s> Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
<s> I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
<s> My son was in the hospital --
<s> I'll loan you a raincoat.
<s> You mean, the insurance frammis?
<s> On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
<s> Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
<s> I will. So long, Bobo.
<s> No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
<s> Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
<s> Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
<s> What? He's going to be all right!
<s> I know.
<s> You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
<s> I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
<s> The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
<s> I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
<s> I guess I owe you my life.
<s> Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
<s> You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
<s> That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
<s> He let me live. He let me be his friend.
<s> Get off the grift, Roy.
<s> No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
<s> As though you do what I say.
<s> Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
<s> Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
<s> My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
<s> I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
<s> No, baby. Come to Mama.
<s> I want to know everything about you.
<s> Oh, don't be stupid.
<s> We'll rent a car.
<s> See you soon.
<s> You already went back to work.
<s> Oh, come on, Roy.
<s> I'm a salesman.
<s> Myra, I'm not following this.
<s> The long end. Big con.
<s> I thought these people were broke.
<s> What happened to Cole?
<s> Where?
<s> Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
<s> You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
<s> What?
<s> For Christ's sake, why not?
<s> No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
<s> Gun?
<s> My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
<s> I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
<s> Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
<s> Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
<s> Happy to see you looking so good.
<s> It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
<s> Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
<s> Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
<s> It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
<s> Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
<s> Detective...
<s> ... I think it would be best if you both left.
<s> Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> Forget it.
<s> I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
<s> Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
<s> Just forget it...
<s> Just get on the bus.
<s> John, you can't help her now.
<s> Why not?
<s> I came to see you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
<s> Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
<s> Are you going to leave, too?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
<s> Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
<s> Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
<s> He's in the bathroom.
<s> Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
<s> Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
<s> Answer what?
<s> The voice man!  He's here!
<s> He says things.  Bad things.
<s> What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
<s> What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
<s> What makes you think he'll come here again?
<s> Jamie?  But I thought she was --
<s> No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
<s> It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
<s> To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
<s> Kara, no!
<s> Wait a minute ...
<s> After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
<s> Or what's left of him.
<s> It's a sign.  He's come home.
<s> I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
<s> Any word on the location of the Strodes?
<s> Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
<s> Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
<s> I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
<s> No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
<s> No one.
<s> No!!!
<s> I'm gonna wet my pants.
<s> Used to be against the law, didn't it?
<s> Must have changed that law.
<s> Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
<s> At least!
<s> It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
<s> Tell them yourself!
<s> This room is full of ghosts.
<s> Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
<s> Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
<s> She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
<s> Really?
<s> Sorry.
<s> The posies are for her?
<s> I forget mine for years on end.
<s> What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
<s> I've considered that.
<s> You're hollow, like a woman.
<s> Out!
<s> Hello.
<s> I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
<s> Everybody says he was so brave.
<s> He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
<s> "Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
<s> "The sting."
<s> "The sting."
<s> Wow.
<s> Mhravitch.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Sir?
<s> Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
<s> She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
<s> That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
<s> Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
<s> We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
<s> You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
<s> Who was it?
<s> It's your house, Dad.
<s> What time do you get off work, my child?
<s> Daughter--I love you very much.
<s> The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
<s> We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
<s> Situation.
<s> Paul said you were awfully sick.
<s> He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
<s> Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
<s> You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
<s> People don't use that word any more.
<s> They don't have to feel like slaves.
<s> I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
<s> The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
<s> It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
<s> Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> No you're not!
<s> Almost a Christmas scene.
<s> I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
<s> I see.
<s> Rifle?
<s> If he thinks he's man enough.
<s> I plan to live one hundred years!
<s> What a handsome word.
<s> Don't!
<s> The National Safety Council would be appalled.
<s> Ooops.
<s> Gentlemen--that's nice.
<s> We'll miss you so.
<s> Ahh--then she's still alive.
<s> That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
<s> This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
<s> Lest we forget how cruel you are.
<s> Oooooo.  That hurt.
<s> Now who's being cruel?
<s> Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
<s> I've struck my blow.
<s> Poison.
<s> And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
<s> But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
<s> It's trash now, like mine.
<s> She did?
<s> Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
<s> I don't care what she wears.
<s> Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
<s> All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
<s> Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
<s> Stay home tonight!
<s> You're married!  You've already got a husband!
<s> He's alive!
<s> You're the only woman he ever took out.
<s> Father's friend.
<s> There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
<s> Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
<s> I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
<s> Doing what?
<s> Women are always late.  You'll find out.
<s> We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
<s> Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
<s> I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
<s> No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
<s> What?
<s> Tonight's the night.
<s> That's the XKE.
<s> He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
<s> Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
<s> That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
<s> I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
<s> It's good.  Let him go.
<s> Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
<s> We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
<s> No.
<s> You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
<s> You may do that in the privacy of your room.
<s> Well, I want to...
<s> ...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
<s> I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
<s> Sam?
<s> Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
<s> Yeah. How did you know?
<s> She thinks so.  What do you do?
<s> You know her?
<s> Do you know where she would be?
<s> Last I heard he went to San Diego.
<s> I don't drink, but you can go out.
<s> You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
<s> You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
<s> They believe in the 'TULIP.'
<s> T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
<s> If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
<s> On your own land?
<s> But what?
<s> Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
<s> Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
<s> But then you'll forget about me.
<s> So then, Mr. Mast...
<s> If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
<s> Who's paying you?
<s> And better?
<s> Mr. Van Dorn?
<s> What have you found out?
<s> They are?
<s> But the police...
<s> Do you think she's safe?
<s> Get out.
<s> We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
<s> That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
<s> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
<s> Where is she? Where is the girl?
<s> Rucker.
<s> I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
<s> Who?
<s> Ratan!
<s> What we got is just these here.  What you see.
<s> I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
<s> I don't know nothing, man.
<s> That's all right.
<s> Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
<s> In other words, you want to get laid?
<s> Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
<s> What do you think of that? Or this?
<s> Well, a boy goes like this, see.
<s> Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
<s> Oh.
<s> He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
<s> My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
<s> Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
<s> 'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
<s> Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
<s> Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
<s> Oh, I don't have one.
<s> I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
<s> Out!
<s> Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
<s> I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
<s> Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
<s> Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
<s> Promise?
<s> Eh, fine.
<s> Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
<s> Oh. Eh, I like it.
<s> That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
<s> Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
<s> That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
<s> Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
<s> Well, I don't...
<s> Yes. It's almost there.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
<s> Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
<s> It's so blue.
<s> With Life.
<s> Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
<s> Well, don't go.
<s> ... of you. You'll all end up like this.
<s> Well, they're my species.
<s> Maude.
<s> I took them out.
<s> Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
<s> You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
<s> Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
<s> Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
<s> Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
<s> Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
<s> Perhaps it is.
<s> No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
<s> No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
<s> I wouldn't say "benefit."
<s> Does that worry you?
<s> Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
<s> Yes. What kind of things do you do?
<s> No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
<s> Huh?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
<s> Eh?
<s> Well, I don't...
<s> Harold!
<s> She took my head.
<s> Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
<s> Oh yes. That's fine.
<s> Oh, yes. How did you like that?
<s> Yes!
<s> I know.
<s> I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
<s> God, that's terrible.
<s> What?
<s> If anyone can help, HE can.
<s> So you slept O.K.?
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> What are you talking...
<s> Finish what?
<s> No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
<s> It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
<s> What are you talking about? Who are you?
<s> Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
<s> Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
<s> I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
<s> Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
<s> What is it?
<s> Air and sea backup. What's closest?
<s> There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
<s> He's just going through a phase --
<s> That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
<s> "In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
<s> Agent Myers is your new liaison.
<s> Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
<s> Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
<s> I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
<s> I won't take 'em. They never work.
<s> My arm is fine. Where are you??
<s> No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
<s> I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
<s> Shh! Just a second.
<s> Start in, you got nachos coming.
<s> Alone?
<s> Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
<s> Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
<s> Marco...
<s> Cocky.
<s> Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
<s> You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Sure.
<s> Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
<s> You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
<s> No. That wasn't the deal.
<s> Stay the fuck away from me.
<s> This isn't happening.
<s> I don't want to see the dress.
<s> His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
<s> Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
<s> A box?
<s> Who did?
<s> So you were cheated.
<s> And the blood let you out?
<s> Maybe.
<s> Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
<s> Hi. I got soaked.
<s> The keys are in the kitchen.
<s> Where's Daddy?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Ah!
<s> We'll sell it. Sell everything.
<s> It looks like a bomb's dropped.
<s> I'll be scarred for life.
<s> Are you O.K.?
<s> Can I get you anything?
<s> Kirsty.
<s> What?
<s> That depends.
<s> Let's keep it that way, shall we?
<s> I prefer the floor.
<s> Yeah, why don't I?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> What happened to me?
<s> Wait a moment --
<s> My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
<s> Try me.
<s> I said: I found a room.
<s> I've forgotten.
<s> Never better. You sleep well.
<s> Sure.
<s> Gone?
<s> Yes!
<s> No. It's all over.
<s> I AM house-trained.
<s> It's late.
<s> I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
<s> IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
<s> I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
<s> I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
<s> Well what's the point in that?
<s> Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
<s> Oh, so what's the point then?
<s> Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
<s> What do you mean, "what?"
<s> I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
<s> Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
<s> Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
<s> But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
<s> Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
<s> What band?
<s> We're getting that anyway.
<s> We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
<s> We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
<s> I have a television.
<s> You can be and are wrong.
<s> On Clark Street!
<s> I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
<s> I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
<s> I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
<s> Fine.  That's great.
<s> Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
<s> Yeah, sure...
<s> Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
<s> I'll tape it for you.
<s> I want a tape.
<s> Liz, hold on a second --  What?
<s> "Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
<s> I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
<s> I should be so lucky.
<s> I thought I could give you a lift back.
<s> Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
<s> I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
<s> Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
<s> You really believe that?
<s> Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
<s> Good.  So.  Is it my job?
<s> Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
<s> So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
<s> Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
<s> I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
<s> Fine.  One.
<s> Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
<s> I haven't felt like it.
<s> Nothing.
<s> You do, huh.
<s> Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
<s> They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
<s> I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
<s> Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
<s> Mmnn.
<s> Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
<s> Okay.
<s> Want to know what, exactly?
<s> But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
<s> And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
<s> I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
<s> This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
<s> Hey.  It's Liz.
<s> You called this morning?
<s> No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
<s> Yup.
<s> No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
<s> Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
<s> Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
<s> I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
<s> How's the store?
<s> Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
<s> I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
<s> Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
<s> And I won't take a penny over ninety.
<s> Records are those big round black things, right?
<s> Maybe he's hiding from something.
<s> There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
<s> Then you didn't know Richard later on.
<s> The boy _died_?
<s> Carl Smith.
<s> So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
<s> I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
<s> Basil the II.
<s> -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
<s> I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
<s> I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
<s> Not all of them.
<s> The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
<s> The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> Of bodies.
<s> Come here, Brenna.
<s> I'm just curious.
<s> Now there's a new topic.
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> You and I should talk first.
<s> What makes you so sure he's the one?
<s> Never take up poker, Detective.
<s> It's that important?
<s> You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
<s> What are you doing man?
<s> -In nomine sanctus esperitu-
<s> And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
<s> Pheasant.
<s> Yes.  Always.
<s> I don't know why.
<s> Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
<s> No!
<s> This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
<s> You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
<s> It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
<s> If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
<s> All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
<s> That is not me.
<s> I'll be back when I can.
<s> So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
<s> Far away.
<s> Certainly not me.
<s> Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
<s> You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
<s> I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
<s> So sure?
<s> You are really going to force this, aren't you?
<s> Have you time for some- thing to eat?
<s> Must he go?
<s> Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
<s> I don't know.
<s> We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
<s> You were never a kid.
<s> You're insane.
<s> Leave her out of this.
<s> This isn't done.  Get up.
<s> It's all we have.
<s> Should I care?
<s> Where were you Tuesday night?
<s> I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
<s> I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
<s> The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
<s> His only kid.
<s> We were very close.
<s> No.
<s> I'm sure that's true.
<s> Why don't you fellows get your own news?
<s> A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
<s> Hildy!
<s> I'm getting married tomorrow.
<s> Hello, Bensinger.
<s> Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
<s> My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
<s> Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
<s> Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
<s> Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
<s> Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
<s> No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
<s> I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
<s> Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
<s> No. My mother.
<s> Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
<s> How?
<s> You haven't seen anything yet.
<s> Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
<s> Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
<s> She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
<s> The money? Why?
<s> You'll ask me to what?
<s> Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
<s> You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
<s> Out of the mouths of babes.
<s> Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
<s> All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
<s> Keep away --
<s> Get away, Svengali.
<s> Bermuda... Rich, eh?
<s> No kidding?
<s> What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
<s> Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
<s> Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
<s> No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
<s> I know. Where is he, I said.
<s> Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
<s> Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
<s> Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
<s> That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
<s> Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
<s> All right, Walter.
<s> What tickets?
<s> Is he coming back here?
<s> What did you do with her?
<s> Louie!
<s> Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
<s> Is this the Community Hospital?
<s> When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
<s> Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
<s> Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
<s> Murder, uh?
<s> Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
<s> In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
<s> Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
<s> Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
<s> Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
<s> Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
<s> You grey-haired old Judas!
<s> You're crazy. Where's Mac?
<s> I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
<s> Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
<s> First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
<s> It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
<s> In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
<s> I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
<s> Three bullets! Any good?
<s> Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
<s> Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
<s> Give me a hand with her, will you?
<s> It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
<s> Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
<s> Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
<s> Now, where is he?
<s> Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
<s> Hold her, boys!
<s> This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
<s> You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
<s> No, I couldn't do that.
<s> Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
<s> We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
<s> We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
<s> Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
<s> How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
<s> Now what do you say?
<s> Just -- one -- second!
<s> Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
<s> It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
<s> So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
<s> All right, Judge.
<s> Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
<s> What's the matter? Getting yellow?
<s> But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
<s> No -- what?
<s> Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
<s> "Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
<s> Very simple, Earl.
<s> Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
<s> What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
<s> They're not human!
<s> It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
<s> Quiet, Mollie!
<s> Ssh!
<s> The reprieve for Earl Williams.
<s> Get the Governor on the phone!
<s> Huh?
<s> Who do you think!
<s> I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
<s> Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
<s> I'll explain it tomorrow!
<s> I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
<s> Look out where you're aiming, will you?
<s> Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
<s> His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
<s> Apparently so.
<s> Looking for shrapnel.
<s> Bloody.
<s> Won't they have maps?
<s> It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
<s> Could.
<s> Ask her yourself.
<s> We thought it was poison.
<s> He's the worst liar.
<s> Well, for the baby, really.
<s> Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
<s> I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
<s> I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
<s> There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
<s> There, there, my baby.
<s> Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
<s> Play something, Grace.
<s> Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
<s> Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
<s> Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
<s> What about R.J.?
<s> Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
<s> Baby! Stop!
<s> No, I told you...
<s> Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
<s> Where's that?
<s> OK.
<s> Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
<s> OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
<s> The animals have got nothing to do with it.
<s> Nice.
<s> I was just wondering.
<s> I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
<s> Yeah, I'll do something.
<s> I don't drive cross country.
<s> Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
<s> So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
<s> Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
<s> OK, Boss.
<s> How much further?
<s> What's that?
<s> Way out here?
<s> Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
<s> I'll help ya.
<s> And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
<s> Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
<s> Turn that fucking radio off!
<s> Where ya headed?
<s> There's a dog in the road.
<s> There's not enough room.
<s> Quiet.
<s> I gotta open the gate.
<s> Hmmmmmmmmm?
<s> Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
<s> Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
<s> No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
<s> Grab Mary and come inside.
<s> Tickets for what?
<s> I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
<s> I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
<s> Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
<s> Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
<s> No please, let me sit this one out.
<s> Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
<s> Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
<s> I can't believe...
<s> Yeah, she said we looked queer.
<s> What? I didn't hear anything.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Yep, I suppose it is.
<s> Keys.
<s> His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
<s> Firefly.
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
<s> Sorry.
<s> My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
<s> I um... no, I don't think so...
<s> Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
<s> No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
<s> Wait, I want to say good-bye.
<s> Where we headed?
<s> Call Wydell.
<s> I pray to God there is.
<s> Right.
<s> I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
<s> Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
<s> Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
<s> Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
<s> And think about what you've done.
<s> Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
<s> Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
<s> I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
<s> Not at all.
<s> I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
<s> It's true. I wouldn't lie.
<s> Shit.  Hi, honey.
<s> Hmmmph.
<s> Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
<s> No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
<s> You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
<s> Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
<s> I don't know. Something's missing.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Where do we look for little lost Puff?
<s> Okay, my sweet. Good night.
<s> Please let me go with you.
<s> Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
<s> But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
<s> I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
<s> Really?
<s> He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
<s> Lila, it's Rosie.
<s> Nathan told my brother.
<s> Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
<s> Oh, Rosie.
<s> That's not necessarily a bad thing.
<s> I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
<s> Paper or cloth?
<s> We are animals after all.
<s> Yes, darling.
<s> Yes.
<s> It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
<s> If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
<s> Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
<s> You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
<s> Nothing. Be right out.
<s> Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
<s> Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
<s> Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
<s> Good. Making progress.
<s> My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
<s> Really?
<s> I had sold my fucking soul.
<s> Absolutely!
<s> Ummm. It's good.
<s> I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
<s> Even better.
<s> Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
<s> Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
<s> I have to talk. Is that okay?
<s> I've never been to Louisville.
<s> Soon as I finish my coffee.
<s> That's right, Miss Packard.
<s> For whom and for what?
<s> Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
<s> How?
<s> You ever played billiards before?
<s> Deal the cards.
<s> Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
<s> What is?
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> For who?
<s> Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
<s> There are places. I'll scuffle around.
<s> You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
<s> Miss Packard. How do you do?
<s> How good is he?
<s> I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
<s> No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
<s> C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
<s> You hustlin' me?
<s> 'Bout even.
<s> I don't know.
<s> How're the hands?
<s> I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
<s> In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
<s> Aaaahhhh!
<s> Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
<s> Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
<s> Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
<s> Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
<s> Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
<s> Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
<s> Talk to me, Charlie.
<s> What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
<s> You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
<s> Is that what you think?
<s> Yeah. Just like that.
<s> Would you like to come out tonight?
<s> Oh no, nothing for me.
<s> Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
<s> Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
<s> Ten dollars.
<s> Hi.
<s> Okay, friend.
<s> Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
<s> You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
<s> Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
<s> Fine, thanks.
<s> Eight o'clock.
<s> Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
<s> Around.
<s> I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
<s> No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
<s> You told me.
<s> Museums... art galleries... concerts.
<s> You want to go with me?
<s> No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
<s> Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
<s> I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
<s> A loser?
<s> Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
<s> Yes, I'm glad.
<s> Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
<s> Why?
<s> Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
<s> California. Oakland.
<s> Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
<s> So do you, Fast Eddie.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> With them?
<s> Who?
<s> Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
<s> Yes.
<s> I was so scared.
<s> I'll take you to school.
<s> I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
<s> That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
<s> Yes -- but ...
<s> About what?
<s> I'd believe him.
<s> Who are you calling?
<s> The back door was open.
<s> What kind, Mom?
<s> Connie, don't hang up.
<s> I take it you've heard.
<s> Think nothing of it, Spanky.
<s> All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
<s> He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
<s> And the good news is you won't charge me.
<s> Checkmate.
<s> College nickname.
<s> She didn't take my name when we were married.
<s> You can do that?
<s> I'm making a mess.
<s> We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
<s> What'd I say?
<s> Just getting a feel for her.
<s> Doesn't matter. Game's over.
<s> Then God help us.
<s> The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
<s> And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
<s> Yes, Sir.
<s> Better than we thought.
<s> Then find them.
<s> Roger.
<s> That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
<s> How long would their shields be down?
<s> Well, er... it's slowing down.
<s> It's... slowing down, Sir.
<s> Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> You know how I like to make a big entrance.
<s> Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
<s> I didn't even see them fire!
<s> We're already over Mach 2!
<s> It's all fuzzy.
<s> Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
<s> You sure?
<s> Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
<s> For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
<s> Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
<s> We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
<s> Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
<s> And I am his.
<s> Yes. My treat.
<s> It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
<s> What is it?
<s> Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
<s> Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
<s> Alexandretta. Now we know.
<s> It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
<s> How dare he?!
<s> The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
<s> Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
<s> Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
<s> In that case, I permit you.
<s> But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
<s> You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> You said go between them!
<s> No?
<s> It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
<s> Don't know. Think of something.
<s> How do you know?
<s> All I have to do is scream.
<s> I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
<s> Don't call me that, please.
<s> And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
<s> Right.
<s> He was actually there? You saw him?
<s> Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
<s> Look, can we discuss this later?
<s> I came here to save you.
<s> Umh?
<s> She talks in her sleep.
<s> You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
<s> What?
<s> Head for the fireplace!
<s> What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
<s> All right Dad -- tell me.
<s> And do I detect a rebuke?
<s> Fly... yes. Land... no.
<s> What happens at eleven o'clock?
<s> Junior...
<s> Penitent. Penitent...
<s> Junior?! Dad...
<s> Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
<s> They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
<s> Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
<s> Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
<s> No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
<s> No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
<s> Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
<s> No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
<s> I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
<s> I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
<s> And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
<s> Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
<s> Behind you!
<s> Two are still missing.
<s> Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
<s> Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
<s> They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
<s> Siam.
<s> Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
<s> Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
<s> That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
<s> It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
<s> Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
<s> Keep stroking it!
<s> I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
<s> Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
<s> You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
<s> I've never been so hungry in my life...
<s> You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
<s> Don't catch cold.
<s> I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
<s> That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
<s> No... the heart's still beating!
<s> I'm going down.
<s> There's got to be another way out.
<s> What above the curves?!
<s> Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
<s> You got it!
<s> They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
<s> I know you did!
<s> I'm...inside you.
<s> What's going on?
<s> It wasn't him.
<s> Yes.
<s> Where are we now?
<s> I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
<s> What are you doing in my head, Al?
<s> Loading a gun.
<s> Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
<s> Who was that? Somebody out there?
<s> No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
<s> Then what are you stopping for?
<s> I don't know. I don't want to find out.
<s> They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
<s> I am. You are.
<s> You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
<s> What does it say.
<s> Take a left and your next right.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
<s> The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
<s> I'm at the airport.
<s> What am I supposed to do?
<s> What about it?
<s> Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
<s> The beach.
<s> How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
<s> Good Idea!
<s> Eat it.
<s> For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
<s> What's happening?
<s> What can I do? You're on your own.
<s> Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
<s> Where are you staying?
<s> Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
<s> Why not?!
<s> You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
<s> I don't know what's going on.
<s> ...I've lost something. I must get it back.
<s> Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
<s> Not her. You!
<s> It's not your time. I get time off.
<s> It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
<s> I told you, I have a feeling...
<s> Too late.
<s> A hard left. A hard left.
<s> I can't see a thing.
<s> Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
<s> I've got an idea.
<s> While he makes the run.
<s> And Dieter?
<s> Aim what?
<s> What exactly?
<s> About what?
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> You're lovely.
<s> I'll get us out of here.
<s> It's all we've got.
<s> Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
<s> Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
<s> In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
<s> I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
<s> Then how did you know?
<s> He work for us?
<s> Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
<s> Oh....Sure.
<s> Been hearing voices.
<s> Sir?
<s> Yessir...very good sir.
<s> What's what?
<s> Nothing.
<s> No. No one to speak of.
<s> Yes?
<s> You did.
<s> Hires you for what?
<s> How often they come here?
<s> And you, what do you like?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You did.
<s> He must be a good friend.
<s> Oh sure.
<s> Ryuji and Gruner.
<s> Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
<s> Get us one.
<s> Where would you go to sell a chip?
<s> I said just relax. I'm in full control.
<s> ...across THE BORDER. Come on!
<s> He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
<s> I can't fly it.
<s> Her?
<s> It was you.
<s> But you did it. It was you.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Why?
<s> Why not?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Poor bastard.
<s> That remote control thing?
<s> Lowell?
<s> You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
<s> Sure. Where?
<s> I'll be there.
<s> Yeah. Catch you later.
<s> Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
<s> Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
<s> Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
<s> Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
<s> Maybe later.
<s> I'm cooking pasta primavera.
<s> No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
<s> No, no, we're fine...
<s> Jim, it's Lowell.
<s> Okay.  Lowell?
<s> I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
<s> I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
<s> Where should I wash them?
<s> Jeffrey...
<s> So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
<s> ...you fucked me!
<s> You eating with us?
<s> What "Seven Dwarfs?"
<s> Hardly new news.
<s> Oh, please, Mike...
<s> No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
<s> What I've seen... I've liked.
<s> That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
<s> Did work.
<s> I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
<s> And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
<s> Like what?
<s> Good.  You have kids?
<s> Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
<s> Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
<s> I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
<s> Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
<s> Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
<s> What?
<s> What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
<s> A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
<s> What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
<s> No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
<s> What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
<s> You called me.
<s> Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
<s> Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
<s> A delivery device for nicotine.
<s> You're gonna get your fix...
<s> In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
<s> "There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
<s> There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
<s> When should we do this?
<s> ...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
<s> They hate each other --
<s> Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
<s> She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
<s> You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.

<s> We rest, Your Honor.
<s> Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
<s> I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
<s> Got any symptoms?
<s> Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
<s> Thanks, buddy.
<s> What?
<s> Yes?
<s> What do you mean, was.

<s> Did you see the tape?
<s> What does your lawyer think?
<s> Have you ever been married, Miles?
<s> You just haven't met the right person.
<s> Gotcha.
<s> To him? He's a sick freak.
<s> Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
<s> Marylin! Listen to me.
<s> Howard is a beautiful person.
<s> Have you tried the duck?
<s> Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
<s> I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
<s> Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
<s> And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
<s> Your mother was.
<s> No.
<s> Huh?
<s> Yes, Miles. I accept.
<s> I know.
<s> Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
<s> Fabric and fringe.
<s> I love you. I want to have your baby.
<s> May I come in?
<s> What do you want?
<s> You can't prove anything.
<s> Meaning my house.

<s> I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
<s> Maybe I should reconsider my...
<s> Nothing.
<s> Sorry.
<s> HA!
<s> Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
<s> She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
<s> Who's "Patty."
<s> Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
<s> Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
<s> Who's Rex's guy?
<s> She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
<s> I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
<s> Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
<s> Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times.

<s> You were taken for a buggy ride?
<s> All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
<s> I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
<s> Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
<s> Oh, no.
<s> He doesn't think so much of you either.
<s> It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
<s> Is that his name?
<s> I'm sorry you read it.
<s> I suppose so.
<s> It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one

<s> Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
<s> Sock her!
<s> Any others?
<s> There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

<s> Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
<s> Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
<s> I didn't ask for your advice. 
<s> You're not going to notify my father, are you?
<s> Beat it! 
<s> Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
<s> Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
<s> Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
<s> Smart aleck!
<s> Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
<s> Outside!
<s> Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
<s> Hurry up and get dressed.
<s> If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
<s> I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
<s> Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Oh. Is that how you met him?
<s> You weren't so bad yourself.
<s> You always want to run everything.
<s> Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
<s> At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
<s> You're prejudiced.
<s> Oh, Peter! I was so scared.

<s> No. But I've got a penknife. 
<s> Clever.
<s> When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
<s> Never!  I'm going in and ask him
<s> Come onget in.
<s> Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
<s> Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
<s> Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
<s> You bet I did.
<s> Come here, you little fool!
<s> Left twenty minutes ago.
<s> Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
<s> Why, he'll be back.
<s> Get out!
<s> Yes?
<s> What time is it?
<s> Yeah!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
<s> Yes.
<s> Wait a minute, GordonI
<s> Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
<s> Well, I got it, Joe.
<s> I am, Joe.
<s> Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
<s> They're married all right. I just seen the license.
<s> I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
<s> "How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
<s> Said he was gonna stay a week.
<s> Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
<s> Better start gettin' into your clothes.
<s> Yeah. Come oncome on!
<s> Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
<s> You're not kidnapping her, are you?
<s> Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
<s> Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
<s> "Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
<s> Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
<s> There were no phone records.
<s> I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
<s> Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
<s> You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
<s> Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
<s> Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
<s> What's the other name?
<s> So why does he call himself Bertrand?
<s> Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
<s> When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
<s> It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
<s> Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
<s> Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
<s> Yeah.
<s> This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
<s> I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
<s> No, I did not.
<s> What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
<s> What did they...
<s> Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
<s> How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
<s> Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
<s> And then Sunday?
<s> Did you bag any geese on this trip?
<s> But the boys told us they didn't get any.
<s> Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
<s> Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
<s> But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
<s> But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
<s> Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
<s> So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
<s> I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
<s> How many shots you say you heard?
<s> I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
<s> Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
<s> Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
<s> I know.
<s> A Perry Russo?
<s> Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
<s> No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
<s> Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
<s> Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
<s> Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
<s> I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
<s> Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
<s> What?
<s> I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
<s> Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
<s> I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
<s> Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
<s> I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
<s> Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
<s> Take a look across the street.
<s> Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
<s> I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
<s> How many men?
<s> No.
<s> The Warren Commission call him?
<s> Allen Dulles?
<s> Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
<s> ...and your General?
<s> ...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
<s> And Oswald?
<s> Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
<s> Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
<s> I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
<s> I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
<s> Six.
<s> Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
<s> Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
<s> Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
<s> I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
<s> I know. That's why I went.
<s> I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
<s> You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
<s> I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
<s> That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
<s> She wants to go back to work.
<s> Sure.
<s> The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
<s> I'm not saying another word.
<s> Arrest me.
<s> Can I see your I.D.?
<s> In cash.
<s> I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
<s> I didn't?
<s> How many trips did you make?
<s> Cash poor?
<s> If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
<s> Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
<s> I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
<s> Sure.
<s> It looks nice.
<s> '74, I think.
<s> If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
<s> It's not really something I think about.
<s> Surprise.
<s> Oh, are you? Does she know that?
<s> For now. These relationships never last too long.
<s> Sandra Bullock. You know her?
<s> Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
<s> Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
<s> Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
<s> You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
<s> No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
<s> Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
<s> Why?
<s> Which one?
<s> That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
<s> That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
<s> All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
<s> People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
<s> So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
<s> They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
<s> I didn't say you did.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Not every day?
<s> You know what's in the bag you're taking?
<s> Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
<s> It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
<s> Can I smoke?
<s> I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
<s> Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
<s> Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
<s> Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
<s> What did you say?
<s> But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
<s> If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
<s> Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
<s> I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
<s> I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
<s> So what happens now?
<s> What about me?
<s> That coke was yours, wasn't it?
<s> Kinda.
<s> Who you think got your ass outta jail?
<s> They asked.
<s> I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
<s> I didn't tell 'em anything.
<s> I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
<s> I said, you understand what I'm saying
<s> Baby, I didn't --
<s> I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
<s> I do okay.
<s> I told them.
<s> They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
<s> Yeah, I think a woman.
<s> I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
<s> Managers get ten percent.
<s> I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
<s> She don't know shit about the money.
<s> Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
<s> Four days ago.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Bank robbery.
<s> Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
<s> It's a diet thing?
<s> No.
<s> Detroit.
<s> I don't like dancing.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Who's your partner?
<s> Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
<s> Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
<s> I'm in my underwear.
<s> That was Beaumont.
<s> An employee I had to let go.
<s> That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
<s> Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
<s> In the chest and stomach.
<s> How much it there?
<s> Maybe the Feds got it.
<s> That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
<s> Gonna have to put up cash.
<s> Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
<s> You think you could do that?
<s> Haven't a clue.
<s> House.
<s> She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
<s> Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
<s> Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
<s> I thought you might be asleep.
<s> I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
<s> She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
<s> She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
<s> Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
<s> You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
<s> She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
<s> I was gonna tell you...
<s> No problem.
<s> He leave town?
<s> No! Oh God.
<s> Hello, Sam.
<s> No, don't. But thanks.
<s> You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
<s> I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
<s> You need ... a doctor.
<s> Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
<s> Used you?
<s> What else did he say, Jake?
<s> No. Not really ...
<s> We should get ourselves a lawyer.
<s> I thought you said she didn't say much.
<s> Wiggle your toes.
<s> I know.
<s> I'm walking, aren't I?
<s> It's good to see you.
<s> But I see them.
<s> Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
<s> Jacob Singer.
<s> Whataya mean, no record?
<s> That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
<s> It's freezing.
<s> Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
<s> Go to sleep.
<s> No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
<s> I didn't want to wake you.
<s> Where is the lamp?
<s> Don't ask.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Your kid dropped it off.
<s> No. The little one.
<s> The best.
<s> Lemme see.
<s> I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
<s> What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
<s> I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
<s> If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
<s> I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
<s> It's gone to the top.
<s> You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
<s> Lie down!
<s> You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
<s> In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
<s> Jezzie?
<s> I can do anything I want.
<s> It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
<s> I promise.
<s> Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<s> Who are you? What are you doing to me?
<s> YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
<s> Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
<s> Don't be funny.
<s> You know who I am.
<s> Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
<s> Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
<s> What is it?
<s> I don't know.
<s> One drop?
<s> Well that's good to know.
<s> I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
<s> I no from around here.
<s> Help me!
<s> I'm awake?
<s> Last night! They were as real as you are!
<s> Paul Gruneger!
<s> Count 'em on one hand.
<s> Nope.
<s> Why the hell we drivin' here?
<s> You in trouble?
<s> I don't know what to do.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
<s> Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
<s> How did it happen?
<s> Alright, asshole.
<s> We're not leaving Crutch!
<s> Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
<s> If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
<s> No.
<s> We don't have a choice!
<s> If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
<s> What?
<s> Done?
<s> Sergeant? We thought you were...
<s> What?!
<s> He....He...
<s> And you said high school was boring.
<s> What are you gonna do, tell me?
<s> They're back here.
<s> Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
<s> I'm coming, I'm coming.
<s> Thorgan, suit up.
<s> We could convert fission transistors.
<s> Bring 'em all. Let's move!
<s> Faster! Don't we have another gun?
<s> And now we're all out of it.
<s> Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
<s> Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
<s> I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
<s> What?
<s> Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
<s> Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
<s> Fuckin A...
<s> Negative.
<s> Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
<s> What if we don't?
<s> And what happend to ...?
<s> Not so bad.
<s> I think so, why?
<s> She broke my fucking nose!
<s> Oh I like her a lot.
<s> I'm on my way.
<s> Shut up, Thorgan!
<s> They'll make it.
<s> I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
<s> A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
<s> Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
<s> Crutch?
<s> Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
<s> I'm afraid I cannot assist.
<s> You killed him?
<s> Oh shit! There he is!
<s> Ow!
<s> But?!!
<s> Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
<s> Obviously so.
<s> JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
<s> Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
<s> You wanna die?
<s> Scientists. Very intellegent men.
<s> Hockey player? He's not a ...
<s> Exactly.
<s> On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
<s> Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
<s> You got it.
<s> What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
<s> We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
<s> Tattoo. Had it taken off.
<s> He's taken him!
<s> Do you see the kids?
<s> Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
<s> Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
<s> Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
<s> You going to be all right?
<s> Do I need any more authority?
<s> That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
<s> Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
<s> Why?
<s> No, we just checked the beach...
<s> You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
<s> Let's all have a drink.
<s> Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
<s> I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
<s> A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
<s> Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
<s> Some friends and me took a house.
<s> A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
<s> Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
<s> What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
<s> It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
<s> I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
<s> He's busy.
<s> Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
<s> Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
<s> What do you see?
<s> Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
<s> Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
<s> I don't know...
<s> I'm supposed to be running.
<s> So that's cool with you, then?
<s> I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
<s> But you copy my work every week.
<s> I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
<s> I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
<s> The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
<s> Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
<s> What?
<s> Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
<s> That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
<s> Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
<s> You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
<s> I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
<s> No... I guess not.
<s> I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
<s> I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
<s> Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
<s> I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
<s> It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
<s> Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
<s> Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
<s> Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
<s> Blood and guts.
<s> What do you play?
<s> Commercials.
<s> You're kidding!
<s> Hey, I like this.
<s> Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
<s> God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
<s> You're something else.
<s> You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
<s> So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
<s> I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
<s> Is Vanessa here?
<s> Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
<s> What?
<s> No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
<s> Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
<s> What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
<s> Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No thank you. I'm off sex.
<s> Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
<s> Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
<s> Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
<s> Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
<s> I am a suicide risk.
<s> Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
<s> Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
<s> There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
<s> No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
<s> I'm pregnant.
<s> No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
<s> Or stage parents!
<s> Share the love, Tits!
<s> Right, seriously.
<s> God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
<s> Well, you are kind of... convex.
<s> Are you looking for any other compensation?
<s> I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
<s> I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
<s> I suppose anything's possible.
<s> Karma.
<s> He whips you?
<s> I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
<s> ...That's not true.
<s> Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
<s> Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
<s> It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
<s> She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
<s> Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
<s> Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nah... how much money have you got?
<s> Forget about it, doesn't matter.
<s> Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
<s> Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
<s> The party?
<s> It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
<s> I still think we should have met them first.
<s> Lighten up...
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> I'm finished.
<s> Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
<s> I don't know.
<s> ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
<s> Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
<s> ...Brian hurt his foot.
<s> No, never. Excuse me.
<s> ...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
<s> What is it?
<s> Who are you?
<s> No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
<s> Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
<s> With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
<s> You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
<s> Right.
<s> Are you hungry?
<s> You think he's got any herb?
<s> He lives on 76th?
<s> I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
<s> Yeah me too nigga.
<s> Oh. You like her?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I know what you mean.
<s> Bet.
<s> Fifteen for me.
<s> Yeah probably.
<s> You are?
<s> Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
<s> Yeah me too.
<s> Hey. What are you doin' right now?
<s> You were?
<s> Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
<s> Yeah. I can understand that.
<s> Do you care about me?
<s> Fine Fidget. What's all this?
<s> Bang up stuff.
<s> No...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Do you care about me?
<s> What?
<s> You're OK?
<s> Yeah, I guess so.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
<s> I know.
<s> Mine?
<s> Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
<s> Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
<s> Whah?
<s> You think so?
<s> It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
<s> What?!
<s> Hi Telly. Where you been?
<s> When are you gonna be back?
<s> Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
<s> Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
<s> It's grandmother style.
<s> To come?
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Let's see how much he wants to play.
<s> Homesearchers.
<s> I was at the beach.
<s> I'm positive.
<s> Get off me!
<s> Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
<s> You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
<s> I haven't got time for this.
<s> Just a second.  Hello?
<s> You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
<s> Where is she?
<s> Very good.  How did you know?
<s> They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
<s> Set up some pieces on the big board?
<s> Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
<s> You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
<s> You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
<s> You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
<s> How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
<s> He already did once.
<s> Not really.  It's pretty boring.
<s> My cheering section.
<s> That has nothing to do with it.
<s> Thanks, David.
<s> Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
<s> There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
<s> We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
<s> But we heard him.
<s> I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
<s> Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
<s> I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
<s> He moves around a lot.  Why?
<s> About a quarter to one.
<s> What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
<s> We're going to work on the message.
<s> The most logical choice.
<s> Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
<s> To my room and then I went for a walk.
<s> I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
<s> "Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
<s> We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
<s> That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
<s> Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
<s> When I was very young.
<s> If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
<s> Are we talking about me, or chess?
<s> Getting too hot in here for you?
<s> Because I think he's wrong.
<s> What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
<s> I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
<s> Then why are you backing up?
<s> Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
<s> It's not that easy.
<s> Why not?
<s> I got lucky.
<s> You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
<s> Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
<s> Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
<s> That's worse.
<s> Thank you, but I can wait.
<s> Colwyn.
<s> No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
<s> I don't know how.
<s> I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
<s> Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
<s> Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> You will know, in good time.
<s> You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
<s> He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
<s> Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
<s> I chose the wrong passage.
<s> No! You cannot know that!
<s> Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
<s> I was hoping I might be your friend.
<s> How did you know I had sons?
<s> Hah! You don't know me, boy.
<s> So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
<s> Not sleepy, either?
<s> Hand over your dinner.
<s> Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
<s> I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
<s> Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
<s> I am Quell.
<s> I'd wish for a puppy.
<s> It's right behind you.
<s> Would you desert your friends?
<s> Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
<s> We have plenty of hares.
<s> Hush!
<s> And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
<s> Then look!
<s> These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
<s> Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
<s> It is important to assure the succession.
<s> They will have the life that you and I might have had.
<s> Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
<s> There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
<s> Her name is Death.
<s> It's a hundred leagues from here.
<s> Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
<s> Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
<s> Where is he? My son.
<s> Of what?
<s> Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
<s> Why do you want to know?
<s> Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
<s> OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
<s> No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
<s> ...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
<s> Yes.
<s> Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
<s> Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
<s> How can you say it?
<s> What, for example?
<s> Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
<s> I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
<s> Why?
<s> What?
<s> There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
<s> That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
<s> A little...
<s> Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
<s> ...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
<s> ...Yes.
<s> Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
<s> Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
<s> You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
<s> ...Even his mother wouldn't.
<s> May we have this wolf's name and address?
<s> Where?
<s> High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
<s> I have new dreams now.
<s> You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
<s> What?
<s> Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
<s> You do?
<s> The flowers... they're beautiful.
<s> What?
<s> Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
<s> You like to take walks?
<s> You've just decided, is that right?
<s> When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
<s> You tell stories?
<s> Nine.
<s> Mammoth.
<s> You're amazing.
<s> Walking where?
<s> I told you.
<s> Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
<s> She knew you loved her.
<s> So I've been informed.
<s> What Mr. Parker?
<s> ... The Grapes of Wrath.
<s> I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
<s> Saluting.
<s> Oh, that's not mine.
<s> Hello.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> This isn't right.
<s> Water?
<s> Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
<s> That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
<s> No -- S.E.R.A.
<s> I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
<s> I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
<s> You do?
<s> That's astonishing. Sera, look...
<s> Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
<s> So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
<s> No?
<s> I know that...
<s> OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
<s> Can we just forget it?
<s> Do you want me not to go tonight?
<s> Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
<s> I've been all right.
<s> Yes, of course. How much do you need?
<s> Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
<s> Yuri... are you...
<s> I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
<s> I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
<s> Are we done for today?
<s> He's an ass that's gonna try.
<s> Whatever it is -- it could save you.
<s> How?
<s> I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
<s> Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
<s> Did she have a weapon in her hand?
<s> I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
<s> I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
<s> Thank you!
<s> Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
<s> No, she was crying her eyes out.
<s> Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
<s> See?
<s> Aristotle.
<s> That's terrible!
<s> No.
<s> That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
<s> Licensed attorney or family member?
<s> Relation?
<s> I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
<s> Really?
<s> Yes, he is.
<s> Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
<s> You think?
<s> Your scrunchie?
<s> I will...
<s> Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
<s> Thanks again for your help!
<s> She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
<s> But maybe it is --
<s> You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
<s> Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
<s> Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
<s> Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
<s> I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
<s> What, like on va-kay?
<s> I got bangs!
<s> Of course, I do!
<s> But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
<s> You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
<s> Uh -- sure.
<s> Chuck.
<s> I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
<s> Faith.
<s> Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
<s> Purely a precaution...
<s> Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
<s> To finish last evening's delightful work.
<s> You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
<s> I am afraid of nothing.
<s> To be my bride, of course.
<s> We're both of us damned, my beauty.
<s> Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
<s> Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
<s> So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
<s> Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
<s> Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
<s> You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
<s> What does she want from me?
<s> It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
<s> Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
<s> How is it this hag knows the truth?
<s> Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
<s> And if she thinks me a liar?
<s> Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
<s> Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
<s> It would appear so.
<s> Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
<s> Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
<s> Whatever for?
<s> Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
<s> Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
<s> Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
<s> Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
<s> Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
<s> Something the matter?
<s> Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
<s> Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
<s> God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
<s> Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
<s> There's the way, mates.
<s> Willful creature, that one...
<s> Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
<s> Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
<s> Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
<s> But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
<s> On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
<s> Been telling you that all along, lad.
<s> Fire away!
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> Can you save her?
<s> Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
<s> Never show mercy!
<s> Sapphire!
<s> He'll not escape me.
<s> Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
<s> I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
<s> Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
<s> You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
<s> Sport, indeed.
<s> Unicorn?
<s> Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
<s> Are you honest?
<s> I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
<s> I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
<s> Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
<s> Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
<s> Only what's right...
<s> No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
<s> And I... love you...
<s> Ouch!  Something's biting me.
<s> Pinching me!
<s> Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
<s> I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
<s> Only that?
<s> Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
<s> A faerie's love makes anything possible.
<s> Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
<s> I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
<s> Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
<s> Oh, but I have.
<s> I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
<s> Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
<s> A castle's but stone and mortar --
<s> What are you doing?
<s> We did a lot of the wiring too.
<s> It's so beautiful.
<s> Mom said I should.
<s> I don't think Dad wants you home.
<s> I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
<s> Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
<s> I don't know.
<s> You look better without make-up.
<s> I'll get your back.
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
<s> Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
<s> You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
<s> It would help me if I could kiss you.
<s> He's got a standing invitation.
<s> I've been dreading you.
<s> I flushed it down the toilet.
<s> What are you on?
<s> He buys and sells the world.
<s> I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
<s> I hate this job.
<s> It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
<s> Good.  I was hoping for that.
<s> What can I do for you, George?
<s> She's out with a friend.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> I want you both to stay.
<s> There are no windows facing my...exposure.
<s> Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
<s> To check up on me?
<s> You don't have a choice.
<s> No you don't.
<s> And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
<s> The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
<s> I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
<s> See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
<s> He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
<s> Getting high, I guess.
<s> I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
<s> Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
<s> Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
<s> What's wrong with your back?
<s> Are you taking them still?
<s> I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
<s> Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
<s> A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
<s> We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
<s> I want you to find someone for me.
<s> Three.
<s> She's a little sad, is all.
<s> You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
<s> But you can't call me while you think?
<s> Why would they tow your truck?
<s> Money?
<s> Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
<s> He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
<s> Let's go.
<s> He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
<s> Which?
<s> Sam's favorite.
<s> I dreamed about your house last night.
<s> My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
<s> No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
<s> I think so.
<s> Going on?
<s> Left you?
<s> Not a perfect day.
<s> Don't even...I'm there.
<s> I'm thinking it's too weird now.
<s> Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
<s> Sooner than the Fall.
<s> Sam took them to a movie.
<s> Take it off.
<s> Hey.
<s> Okay.
<s> I didn't go in your room.
<s> This is what he wants.
<s> Why?
<s> Can we really help build a house?
<s> Dad's home, already?
<s> And the baby?
<s> There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
<s> But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
<s> Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
<s> I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
<s> Yes, boss.
<s> Here!
<s> That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
<s> I know it begins with a "C"...
<s> I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
<s> So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
<s> That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
<s> Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
<s> What'd you say?
<s> There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
<s> That jelly you were talking to right here?
<s> It ain't here.
<s> Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
<s> Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
<s> Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
<s> I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
<s> I'm stuck!
<s> He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
<s> I don't know. Who do you want?
<s> I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
<s> Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
<s> Let me see that.
<s> Make 'em throw strikes.
<s> They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
<s> That was five years ago.
<s> You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
<s> And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
<s> Hey, there's Wilkins!
<s> No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
<s> He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
<s> Yeah? You and what army?
<s> I'm sorry, he's on medication...
<s> 'Preciate it. Claude.
<s> I try to moisturize regularly.
<s> Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
<s> Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
<s> Made just for you, Cookie.
<s> New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
<s> You heard the boss! Let's move!
<s> You heard what the man said! Move it!
<s> What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
<s> I prefer bourbon.
<s> I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
<s> Are you offering me a bribe?
<s> That's a long story...
<s> You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
<s> I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
<s> Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
<s> But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
<s> Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
<s> All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
<s> You shouldn't have come here.
<s> Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
<s> Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
<s> Don't do it!
<s> Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
<s> Show him Central Park.
<s> My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
<s> Well tell her I said "hi" back.
<s> We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
<s> She's so nice.
<s> No.
<s> Release the evil?
<s> Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
<s> Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
<s> So go get 'em, Dad!
<s> Son, just do your best.
<s> What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
<s> Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
<s> That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
<s> I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
<s> By she, do you mean he?
<s> Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
<s> Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
<s> Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
<s> Dude. Seriously?
<s> You smell like coconuts.
<s> Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
<s> My dad's an optometrist.
<s> If you want to.
<s> It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
<s> Basically, yeah.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
<s> Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
<s> "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
<s> I have to, Valerie.
<s> Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
<s> I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
<s> See something you like, my man?
<s> Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
<s> Where do you send them?
<s> Nude. Imagine, a pair.
<s> Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
<s> Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
<s> Your own work?
<s> I don't care... Just get it over with.
<s> Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
<s> I'm Mary 2.
<s> I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
<s> No.  Just no.
<s> No.
<s> Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
<s> He was killed.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I'm afraid to tell you.
<s> I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
<s> I'm going to run.
<s> You know something.
<s> That's tomorrow.
<s> Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
<s> I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
<s> He's good, isn't he?
<s> It's the only way.
<s> Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
<s> It doesn't make any difference anymore.
<s> I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
<s> I doubt it.
<s> How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
<s> Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
<s> He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
<s> Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
<s> Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
<s> Yes...
<s> Mother and Father said so... you know?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh, my...
<s> Hello.
<s> It's all right with me. Is he here?
<s> For as long as I can remember.
<s> Gracious... no.
<s> Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
<s> I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
<s> I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
<s> Texaco... What's wrong with that?
<s> No, I'm okay.
<s> This is our bedroom.
<s> No. Fred hates them.
<s> And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
<s> Right... This just glided along.
<s> Me, too.
<s> Me, too.
<s> So what do we do?
<s> He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
<s> Oh, yeah?... What else?
<s> We killed him.
<s> We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
<s> Up the stairs - down the hall.
<s> Sit down a minute.
<s> But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
<s> No.
<s> I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
<s> Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
<s> I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
<s> I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
<s> Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
<s> What about yesterday?
<s> Nothin'.
<s> Who was the man?
<s> Not even close.
<s> No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
<s> The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
<s> Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
<s> I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Called? When?
<s> Yes, I just found it on the step.
<s> But...
<s> No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
<s> Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
<s> Pornos?
<s> It'll be ready.
<s> At your house. Don't you remember?
<s> Yeah?...
<s> Sure.
<s> What night?
<s> Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
<s> I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Come on.
<s> FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
<s> Thank you.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Okay, brother.
<s> All right, all right. Keep quiet.
<s> Will you stop squawking!
<s> Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
<s> I'm thinking.
<s> Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
<s> colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
<s> Come on, Lovey.
<s> Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
<s> Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
<s> It's unbelievable.
<s> All right.
<s> Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
<s> Leaving?
<s> How do you do?
<s> I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
<s> They were.
<s> Centuries.
<s> Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
<s> And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
<s> Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
<s> I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, I'm so glad.
<s> Now, what would you like to do?
<s> Splendid!
<s> Thank you.
<s> Pardon me
<s> Are you so certain you are away from it?
<s> Yes.
<s> No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
<s> Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
<s> Oh, the girl at the piano?
<s> It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
<s> Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
<s> You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
<s> Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
<s> Why - I'm sorry - but I
<s> You can't leave, George.
<s> I don't need any proof.
<s> Is that all my story meant to you?
<s> I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
<s> What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
<s> Yes, everything!
<s> Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
<s> Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
<s> What if he refuses?
<s> Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
<s> Yes. Hold this pigeon.
<s> Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
<s> I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
<s> You see, it's not a dream.
<s> Why?
<s> Why, mother?
<s> How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
<s> English!
<s> Please don't go.
<s> Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
<s> Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
<s> Cowan--
<s> It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
<s> It's not even a fucking door.
<s> What the hell...
<s> For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
<s> What happens if I say no?
<s> Well this didn't.
<s> All the time, sir.
<s> Yup.  Sure is.
<s> Sir, you can't just--
<s> I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
<s> Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
<s> It was a long time ago.-
<s> I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
<s> Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
<s> I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
<s> We're rising.
<s> What if he's telling the truth?
<s> Since as long as we've been keeping records...
<s> I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
<s> Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
<s> I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
<s> They respond to fear, right?
<s> You figured what?
<s> I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
<s> Scientific American?  Really?
<s> May I have a look?
<s> Come again?
<s> Is it now?
<s> Please --
<s> Anderton --
<s> Someplace safe.
<s> Why?
<s> Oh, Jesus...
<s> Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
<s> Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
<s> -- go blind.  I know.
<s> This is the official composite of the three precogs?
<s> ... Graveyard shift.
<s> I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
<s> He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
<s> We won't let them.
<s> All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
<s> I'm not getting halo'd.
<s> Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
<s> I show a cop on horseback.
<s> Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
<s> Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
<s> No maglev system.
<s> Yeah?  So?
<s> Did Marks close the front door?!
<s> Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
<s> Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
<s> What does he think of your chosen line of work?
<s> It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
<s> Do I know you?  Who are you?
<s> Oh... Hi, John.
<s> Rufus.  She's a precog.
<s> That's right.
<s> You gotta have faith, Dad.
<s> I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
<s> I'm your son.  I'm you.
<s> Some -- somebody's father?
<s> I'm a little dizzy...
<s> I'm... not... a... killer.
<s> The system would collapse.
<s> I'll be right there.
<s> Thank you.  This is Burgess.
<s> What?
<s> Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nice to meet you.  Gum?
<s> That's the Red Ball Alarm.
<s> I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
<s> Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
<s> I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
<s> I know who you are.
<s> Yes.
<s> To what?  Trap him?
<s> What does he want with a precog?
<s> But there's still the other two.
<s> You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
<s> Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
<s> So?
<s> Is it the good room?
<s> What if I gave you forty?
<s> No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
<s> Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
<s> No.
<s> Somebody's getting comfortable.
<s> Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
<s> I love you. Come home.
<s> The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
<s> Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
<s> Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
<s> Ho's a good guy --
<s> Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
<s> Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
<s> Draw.
<s> 5-5-1.
<s> She'll be out in a minute.
<s> To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
<s> We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
<s> No.
<s> He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
<s> That's why they call it the smart money.
<s> Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
<s> I know.
<s> He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
<s> You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
<s> What is it?
<s> We get it. We're sorry.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ruiz isn't here.
<s> Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
<s> He's not here.
<s> Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Don't be shitty.
<s> I know the number.
<s> He didn't say we need guns.
<s> Bullshit...
<s> Fuck him.
<s> I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
<s> I'm not taking her to a bar.
<s> This paint sucks. The white shows through.
<s> We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
<s> You sure?
<s> Forty-six.
<s> But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
<s> Nothing.
<s> They asked who it was.
<s> Missing what? He didn't say shit.
<s> Work's over. I'm gonna party.
<s> Fine.
<s> Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
<s> She was jonesing for me.
<s> Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
<s> They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
<s> Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
<s> I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
<s> Ugh...
<s> The videos.
<s> Where do you live?
<s> Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
<s> Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
<s> Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
<s> 'Strapped?'
<s> What? Why am I bad?
<s> I'll tell him someone else told me.
<s> I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
<s> Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
<s> Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
<s> You think this shit's funny, Ho?
<s> The Soho Grand?
<s> Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
<s> We're square.
<s> Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
<s> Tell me.
<s> But, Max --
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
<s> Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
<s> That's none of your fucking business.
<s> And where might that be?
<s> Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
<s> A rose by any other name would --
<s> Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
<s> He had it coming.
<s> Red, and I ain't no punk.
<s> YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Solid, daddy.
<s> I'll take your goddam bet.
<s> Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
<s> You know it.
<s> There's two guns on you.
<s> I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
<s> That's a fact. What you do, boy?
<s> Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
<s> Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
<s> When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
<s> Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
<s> Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
<s> What do you do with your time?
<s> That's what Mama used to say.
<s> But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
<s> No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
<s> I sure met some.
<s> Tell Him that.
<s> You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
<s> I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
<s> Next week, Brother Minister.
<s> I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
<s> I can handle it.
<s> Why do you ask?
<s> Because you're in trouble.
<s> There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
<s> Shhh!
<s> I'm tired of praying.
<s> Just what is your question?
<s> Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
<s> What?
<s> I say a lot of things.
<s> With him?
<s> Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
<s> Now you come back.
<s> I know where you're going.
<s> All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
<s> Please make way, please --
<s> How long has this been going on?
<s> And don't come back.
<s> Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
<s> C'mere.
<s> You hear me, girl?
<s> I ain't doing bad.
<s> Tell him about Baldy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
<s> That's right.
<s> He told you that?
<s> Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
<s> So you are going to talk me to death.
<s> It's a little late.
<s> He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
<s> He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
<s> [Daniel what?]
<s> [We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
<s> [The what?]
<s> [Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
<s> [Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
<s> [Her life for your life.]
<s> [You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
<s> It's loaded.
<s> What do you mean, I'm here?
<s> The United States.
<s> You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
<s> Why not?
<s> No.
<s> Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
<s> My ankle.
<s> I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
<s> No, that was in Columbia.
<s> There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
<s> Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
<s> I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
<s> If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
<s> And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
<s> Yeah? And if she was ugly?
<s> When?
<s> This is Mr. Creasy.
<s> I think it's fantastic.
<s> Hmm?
<s> Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
<s> [Is that good or bad?]
<s> [And left three more dead men.]
<s> [He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
<s> You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
<s> What was she to Creasy then?
<s> All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
<s> What?
<s> Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
<s> I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
<s> Which one was that?
<s> Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
<s> That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
<s> It's her baby too, you know.
<s> Well, it ain't your baby.
<s> You told me.
<s> What happen?
<s> Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
<s> This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
<s> Thank you.
<s> There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
<s> It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
<s> I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
<s> I'm afraid of being lonely.
<s> I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
<s> It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
<s> No, I'm not kidding.
<s> I'll see you around.
<s> Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
<s> That's the one.
<s> Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
<s> Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
<s> Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
<s> Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
<s> You gotta good heart.
<s> I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
<s> We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
<s> What, Ma?
<s> Waddaya read there, Joe?
<s> No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
<s> Well...
<s> Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
<s> Hello, Thomas.
<s> Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
<s> So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
<s> Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
<s> I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
<s> That's all right, that's all right...
<s> Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
<s> All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
<s> Waddaya talking about?!!
<s> I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
<s> I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
<s> Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
<s> Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
<s> Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
<s> Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
<s> I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
<s> How you, Radar?
<s> You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
<s> That's right.
<s> Hospital.
<s> No.  Or why you should.
<s> Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
<s> I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
<s> There's only one way.
<s> Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
<s> Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
<s> Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
<s> You make a mean martini, kid.
<s> Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
<s> C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
<s> Call Dago Red.
<s> Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
<s> You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
<s> Be right with you.
<s> We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
<s> Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
<s> Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
<s> Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
<s> And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
<s> Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
<s> Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
<s> At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
<s> You betcher ass, General.
<s> Right.
<s> We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
<s> Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
<s> All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
<s> If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
<s> I like an olive.
<s> The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
<s> And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
<s> How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> Not necessarily.
<s> Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
<s> No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
<s> 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
<s> Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
<s> Maria...
<s> I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
<s> Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
<s> That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
<s> Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
<s> Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
<s> That. It's out of the act.
<s> Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
<s> But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
<s> I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
<s> Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
<s> It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
<s> I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
<s> Morning, Captain.
<s> May I have the surgeon's name, please?
<s> The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
<s> But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
<s> Nice.
<s> It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
<s> Um-hum.
<s> Can't. I'm feeling too good.
<s> With all of it?
<s> You got me.
<s> You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
<s> Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
<s> Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
<s> Me?
<s> About me?
<s> Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
<s> I guess so. Then what happened?
<s> Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
<s> John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Money.
<s> Oh, I'm sure I can.
<s> Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
<s> Your purse. I need ten dollars.
<s> Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
<s> There is no letter.
<s> Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
<s> If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
<s> Thank you.
<s> That's
<s> Oh, let me go, will you!
<s> Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
<s> Did you find her?
<s> The heelots!
<s> Sure. Mostly often.
<s> I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
<s> Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
<s> Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
<s> Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
<s> Yeah. It certainly is.
<s> Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
<s> Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
<s> No.
<s> No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
<s> Did you write itor didn't you?
<s> You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
<s> Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
<s> Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
<s> Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
<s> Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
<s> Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
<s> Yeah, okay.
<s> Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
<s> May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
<s> I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
<s> Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
<s> They want Walter dead!
<s> Automatic.
<s> Wait a minute, lemme see that.
<s> Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
<s> Roper, we're into it...
<s> Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
<s> You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
<s> What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Like it had to be done.
<s> A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
<s> You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
<s> I don't really like to drink.
<s> Explain how that works.
<s> I think I can handle that one.
<s> I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
<s> Why?
<s> A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
<s> Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
<s> Yeah, first and second.
<s> Police corruption. It's everywhere.
<s> Damnit!
<s> You've got to decide that for yourself.
<s> Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
<s> Only that floor.
<s> What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
<s> And why the fuck would you do that for me?
<s> Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
<s> Greg.
<s> Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
<s> Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
<s> You heard.
<s> Can I come in?
<s> Scott, You can't save everyone.
<s> You got a bet on the game tonight?
<s> No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
<s> Scottie...
<s> Just now.
<s> He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
<s> In Europe women find older men very sexy.
<s> Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
<s> Your concern is heartwarming.
<s> Okay, I think I could swing that.
<s> I'll provide you with transportation.
<s> He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
<s> 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
<s> I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
<s> Okay...
<s> -- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
<s> If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
<s> There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
<s> About what?
<s> Someone who believes in miracles.
<s> No...
<s> Wake up?!
<s> True.  But why?
<s> It's not real.
<s> -- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
<s> One would assume so.
<s> Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
<s> Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
<s> Go!
<s> Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
<s> What?
<s> Good question.
<s> Why would I do that?
<s> No.
<s> Once they digitized you, they added it.
<s> It was a test.
<s> Way you kiss me.
<s> Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
<s> Because you'll never believe me.
<s> Resurrection.
<s> Destination?
<s> Checking connection.
<s> Uplink selected.
<s> Speed?
<s> IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
<s> ... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
<s> Ah... sure.
<s> Stylin'!
<s> Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
<s> I've never been this sore in my life.
<s> There should be a way to open it.
<s> Activating Power Beam!
<s> The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
<s> Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
<s> What's a Triac?
<s> I think so.
<s> I am the crane, agile and sublime!
<s> NINJA WOLF ZORD!
<s> This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
<s> Release the power with the power.
<s> LET'S FLY!
<s> WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
<s> Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
<s> BULK!!
<s> Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
<s> You forgot to say 'Simon says."
<s> GO POWER RANGERS!
<s> Activating Power Scope!
<s> But I've never served a day.
<s> But ya got a Boss.
<s> Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
<s> Poor, yeah.
<s> Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
<s> Why should I be?
<s> Could we step outside?
<s> Can't we get a couple whores over?
<s> He was around...
<s> He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
<s> Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
<s> I was calling yesterday.
<s> London?
<s> It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
<s> I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
<s> And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
<s> I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
<s> Might as well put the time to use.
<s> I told you twenty!
<s> It'll just be a few minutes.
<s> The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
<s> Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
<s> He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
<s> So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
<s> Not if they all die at once.
<s> I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
<s> Don, I'd be honored.
<s> The name's Charlie.
<s> I've got friends.
<s> He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
<s> What about the share.
<s> You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
<s> Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
<s> No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
<s> Spare us.
<s> Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
<s> Yeah. But he needs me alive.
<s> Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
<s> Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
<s> Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
<s> I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
<s> I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
<s> I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
<s> Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
<s> He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
<s> Tell me what?
<s> You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
<s> But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
<s> Stu, are you...feeling okay?
<s> That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
<s> Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
<s> It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
<s> Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
<s> Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
<s> I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
<s> Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
<s> No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
<s> I just need to use the phone, lady.
<s> We like to think so, yeah.
<s> What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
<s> That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
<s> Mother!
<s> Behind the books.
<s> That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
<s> No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
<s> Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
<s> I can make my own decisions.
<s> Goodbye, sweetheart.
<s> It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
<s> Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
<s> What does he do?
<s> Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
<s> Forty-five all total.
<s> Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
<s> Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
<s> It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
<s> I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
<s> That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
<s> Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
<s> What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
<s> Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
<s> He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
<s> And to Don Quixote!
<s> My friends?
<s> Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
<s> *I'm* just waiting for a street car--
<s> Again? Good idea.
<s> Well, let's get going.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, I know. That's okay.
<s> No--not offhand--
<s> You said it!
<s> Take me home, Diz.
<s> He's a house-afire!
<s> Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
<s> Great saints!
<s> Can't that wait, Hubert?
<s> Nonsense.
<s> Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
<s> All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
<s> *You* tell Jim Taylor.
<s> This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
<s> Is *what* getting me down?
<s> Emma! Will you *please*--?
<s> Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
<s> Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
<s> When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
<s> Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
<s> Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
<s> Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
<s> For one week!
<s> No.
<s> The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
<s> Here--where are you running off to?
<s> That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
<s> Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
<s> Satan's in this little fella tonight!
<s> Office of--Senator Smith?
<s> Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
<s> Did you say--bus?
<s> Most natural thing in the world!
<s> Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
<s> I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
<s> Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
<s> I know--but you--you're going to help.
<s> Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
<s> How?
<s> Why?
<s> Yes, I see that.
<s> We're over in the House.
<s> I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
<s> But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
<s> Terrible, thank you.
<s> I also answer to whistles.
<s> No!
<s> No!
<s> Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
<s> No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
<s> Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
<s> Second drawer.
<s> Don't mention it--
<s> Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
<s> Wait--
<s> But--I've done everything I--
<s> Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
<s> If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
<s> Wonderful!
<s> Well! You don't say!
<s> You're not going to take your *suit* off!
<s> You were about to recognize me, sir--
<s> Ring the call to quorum.
<s> Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
<s> A Bill! Not *him*!
<s> I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
<s> Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
<s> You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
<s> What do you mean?
<s> He's lost complete faith in me--
<s> He did it.
<s> Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
<s> Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
<s> Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
<s> Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
<s> Jim, I won't stand for it.
<s> Jim, you don't have to--
<s> It's crucifying him--!
<s> No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
<s> I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
<s> Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
<s> Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Sometimes he whistles.
<s> Yes, indeedy.
<s> I haven't.
<s> Your Honor!
<s> Yes!
<s> Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
<s> Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
<s> Really?
<s> Oh, I don't mind.
<s> What did they say?
<s> What did they say?
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing
<s> He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
<s> He did? I play the tuba
<s> Sure!
<s> Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
<s> Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
<s> Let's just walk, okay?
<s> No, I don't mind.
<s> Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
<s> Yeah, then what?
<s> Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
<s> Have lunch.
<s> Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
<s> Last night he proposed to me.
<s> Oh, as bad as that, huh?
<s> Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
<s> Hello . . .
<s> Babe ought to get him drunk again.
<s> Come on - let's go!
<s> They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
<s> Perfect! Perfect!
<s> Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
<s> I wanna see that guy!
<s> They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
<s> You can't?
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> All right.
<s> Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
<s> Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
<s> That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
<s> Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
<s> Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
<s> Oh.
<s> No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
<s> That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
<s> Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
<s> Shut up!
<s> Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
<s> Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
<s> Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
<s> I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
<s> You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
<s> Ja.
<s> Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
<s> You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
<s> What about it, Mr. Deeds?
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
<s> Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
<s> Well, I play the tuba.
<s> Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
<s> Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
<s> Don't pay any attention to her.
<s> Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
<s> Excuse me. What did you say?
<s> Prairie? Oysters?
<s> Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
<s> Who?
<s> What, sir?
<s> You try it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
<s> I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
<s> Take your time.
<s> A friend?
<s> My approach?
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
<s> Mr. Follett.
<s> You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
<s> You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
<s> Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
<s> I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
<s> A little.
<s> She seems very unhappy.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
<s> I'd better get in there.
<s> It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, I don't know...
<s> Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
<s> It's a pretty piece of land.
<s> ...And?
<s> Why do you watch?
<s> ...so accomplished.
<s> Lily.
<s> You would have met in some shower eventually...
<s> That's it? That's what you're giving me?
<s> Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
<s> -- Go on!
<s> You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
<s> Sure.
<s> You're good.
<s> Martin.
<s> Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
<s> Mumford... like the town?
<s> Could I see Sofie, please?
<s> I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
<s> I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
<s> Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
<s> I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
<s> I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
<s> I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
<s> No.
<s> So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
<s> I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
<s> Disgusting.
<s> I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
<s> That's one way to put it.
<s> No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
<s> Okay...
<s> What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
<s> You're not the only one...
<s> I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
<s> I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
<s> Will you be here?
<s> Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
<s> It's called pro bono.
<s> Where was this?
<s> What happened today?
<s> Was it something that happened at school?
<s> How are you?
<s> Of course! That's exactly what I want.
<s> Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
<s> Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
<s> Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
<s> -- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
<s> No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
<s> Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
<s> Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
<s> Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
<s> That'd be Lily.
<s> Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
<s> No... no training.
<s> Yep.
<s> I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
<s> Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
<s> So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
<s> I've had worse.
<s> That's one way of putting it.
<s> Oh yes, always.
<s> Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
<s> You will not believe it.
<s> Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
<s> Water turning to blood.
<s> What did you do to him!?
<s> Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
<s> If you call that a kiss.
<s> The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
<s> Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
<s> I know my treasure.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> We're about to be shown the way.
<s> What are those mirrors for?
<s> Preparation for what?
<s> Who was talking about what?
<s> You don't believe in curses, huh?
<s> I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
<s> No you're not.
<s> You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
<s> FINE.
<s> What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
<s> Got what?
<s> Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
<s> Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
<s> My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
<s> I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
<s> Way to go, Evy.
<s> No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
<s> He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
<s> I know you did.
<s> That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
<s> Your mind is so slippery.
<s> Head hunting.
<s> Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
<s> My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
<s> Atta, boy!
<s> I'm the Bowler.
<s> But you're a superhero.
<s> Thanks.
<s> He's dead.
<s> Think positive.
<s> I got it.
<s> Should I kill them?
<s> Captain who?
<s> And the nuts always call themselves great.
<s> They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
<s> I'm not that kind of girl.
<s> Roy.
<s> Not tonight. 
<s> Roy.
<s> It's home.
<s> I just want to be a superhero.
<s> Monica, where are you?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> And what if you get killed?
<s> Good or evil, what's the difference?
<s> LOOK!
<s> What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
<s> What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
<s> Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
<s> Wait!... Look!
<s> Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
<s> Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
<s> Yes.
<s> We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
<s> Oh hi, Mom.
<s> I always knew that you were special.
<s> We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
<s> And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
<s> Who are they?
<s> Whatever our name is.
<s> It's suicide.
<s> With or without him, we gotta go!
<s> Through there!
<s> I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
<s> Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> Cavalry?
<s> You could have them here by daybreak.
<s> Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
<s> It is on this road, sire, following me.
<s> The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
<s> But who made this treaty?
<s> Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
<s> What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
<s> It is a terrible shock.
<s> I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
<s> No, sire... I was asleep.
<s> To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
<s> Come back in an hour.
<s> Come in.
<s> No, sir, none at all.
<s> A glass of champagne, please.
<s> You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
<s> Four o'clock.
<s> From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
<s> He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
<s> Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
<s> One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
<s> Is it a nice warm room, sir?
<s> Well, you shall see.
<s> I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
<s> My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
<s> And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
<s> Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
<s> Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> All right -- I promise.
<s> Where is Madame Trillaud?
<s> What are you doing in there?
<s> Yes.
<s> Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
<s> Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
<s> There's probably some explanation.
<s> I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
<s> That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
<s> My God, what do you think?
<s> God help me -- yes.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes, of course.  What do you want?
<s> No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
<s> Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
<s> You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
<s> I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
<s> I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
<s> Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
<s> I did not ask her to go to war against me.
<s> Yes, he has.
<s> That is correct.
<s> A message from Citizen Fouche.
<s> Good.
<s> I don't know!
<s> Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
<s> Don't move me.
<s> Yes you did.
<s> I don't know... I think he went out the back.
<s> Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
<s> Not me.
<s> That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
<s> Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
<s> Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
<s> Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
<s> You already in.
<s> I didn't see nothing.
<s> What's the B-G's?
<s> Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
<s> I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
<s> Oh yeah, why you walking?
<s> Hell yeah, I remember you.
<s> It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
<s> Why didn't she put'em out?
<s> So what?  Let's make'em wait.
<s> Hold on.
<s> Well bring yo' ass on...
<s> I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
<s> I do.
<s> Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
<s> Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
<s> You damn right that's the big one.
<s> You could sell your Beamer.
<s> Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
<s> Ya'll live around here?
<s> Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
<s> What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
<s> What urgent message?
<s> I'll take you later.
<s> Shut yo' ass up.
<s> Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
<s> The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
<s> Huh?
<s> I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
<s> I...
<s> Ah.
<s> Same to you.
<s> Don't worry. She's good with kids.
<s> Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
<s> At one thirty my little girl is dead.
<s> That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
<s> That's right. That gives you...
<s> Don't you threaten me.
<s> I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
<s> Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
<s> Keep it.
<s> Keep it.
<s> Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
<s> What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
<s> What are you supposed to do?
<s> Don't think I won't.
<s> Hi.
<s> Thanks for the tip.
<s> No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
<s> My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
<s> Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
<s> Why?
<s> Keep your eyes peeled.
<s> Come with me, honey.
<s> I kill her anyway.
<s> Only you.
<s> 'Daddy has to go now.
<s> Not even her?
<s> When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
<s> No.
<s> It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
<s> They hid in a broom closet!
<s> But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Walt!
<s> Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
<s> Bluebeard!
<s> Come on!
<s> String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
<s> John don't like him much.
<s> There's something else.
<s> It's a shame!
<s> Amen.
<s> You what?
<s> Yes, I reckon that's it.
<s> We'll steal somethin' to eat.
<s> Up river.
<s> You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
<s> In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
<s> Come to me, boy!
<s> What secret shall I tell?
<s> That's no secret. I'm five.
<s> Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
<s> All right.
<s> Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
<s> But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
<s> Can I have this?
<s> Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
<s> I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
<s> A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
<s> He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
<s> No, Harry! I thought --
<s> Harry, what --
<s> My flesh and blood!
<s> Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
<s> What?
<s> It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
<s> Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
<s> Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
<s> Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
<s> Haven't slept, have you?
<s> No.
<s> I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
<s> I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
<s> Hi.
<s> Who?
<s> You do?
<s> Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
<s> If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
<s> What?
<s> Just want to talk to him a second.
<s> Deal.
<s> Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
<s> Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
<s> Uh, she just saw you, sir...
<s> It wasn't that serious...
<s> Right home after. See you.
<s> Yes, Mother. G'night.
<s> I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
<s> Go on...
<s> I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
<s> He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
<s> Nobody's gonna kill you.
<s> I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
<s> How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
<s> No.
<s> Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
<s> Have you any money?
<s> From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
<s> You should be more careful, Anna.
<s> I have nothing to hide.
<s> And there?
<s> Or it might be the firing squad!
<s> I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
<s> But what can we do?... We have to accept.
<s> We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
<s> No, that's bad management.
<s> Don't worry... there will be enough.
<s> Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
<s> Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
<s> Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
<s> Go to bed.
<s> I don't feel like any breakfast.
<s> Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
<s> Count d'Algout...
<s> Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
<s> I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
<s> It is Thursday!
<s> We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
<s> ...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
<s> Razinin.
<s> Comrade.
<s> A day.
<s> Too bad we have to waste all that time.
<s> Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
<s> Monsieur.
<s> Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
<s> Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
<s> Well, we're back home.
<s> Even the swallows are back.
<s> The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
<s> I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
<s> Or a tunnel or a bridge...
<s> What?
<s> You might hold this for me.
<s> I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
<s> I don't have to but I find it natural.
<s> I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
<s> No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
<s> It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
<s> Thank you. Thank you.
<s> I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
<s> Wounded? How?
<s> I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
<s> The telephone is ringing.
<s> I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
<s> All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
<s> Why?
<s> Then you should go back to your table.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
<s> Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
<s> Anything, Ninotchka.
<s> Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
<s> No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
<s> No speech?
<s> I love you, my little Leonitchka!
<s> Much happier.
<s> Let's turn on the radio.
<s> Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
<s> They belong to the people.
<s> The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
<s> If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
<s> Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
<s> We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
<s> Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
<s> Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
<s> Huh?
<s> I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
<s> Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
<s> Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
<s> It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
<s> Am I interrupting?
<s> I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
<s> Yes.
<s> If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
<s> People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
<s> It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
<s> I told you to go, madame.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Why?
<s> That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
<s> Where do you eat?
<s> Where is it?
<s> Then tell Richardson to fire him.
<s> No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
<s> I like that.  That's a solution.
<s> Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
<s> You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
<s> John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
<s> The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
<s> Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
<s> Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
<s> He wants money.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
<s> Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
<s> Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
<s> No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
<s> He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
<s> Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
<s> It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
<s> Mr. Hoover was a realist.
<s> The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
<s> Can we get around this, Al?
<s> What's Liddy got?
<s> Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
<s> It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
<s> No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
<s> The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
<s> The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
<s> Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
<s> The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
<s> I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
<s> What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
<s> They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
<s> No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
<s> What?
<s> My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
<s> ... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
<s> Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
<s> For God's sake, when does this end?!
<s> I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
<s> Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
<s> What?
<s> My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
<s> Cuba would be a small price to pay.
<s> Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
<s> If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
<s> Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
<s> It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
<s> Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
<s> Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
<s> It won't.  As long as I'm here.
<s> I won't tell him if you won't.
<s> She's quite pretty.
<s> He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
<s> Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
<s> It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
<s> What do you mean, Jack?
<s> The American people put me where I am.
<s> He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
<s> Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
<s> Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
<s> They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
<s> How a fat man gets so many girls.
<s> Yes, Mr. President.
<s> That was Mr. Kennedy.
<s> Looks can be deceiving ...
<s> Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
<s> We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
<s> Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
<s> How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
<s> You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
<s> ... but it was all we had.
<s> You're shittin' me.
<s> But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
<s> Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
<s> Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
<s> I like jazz ...
<s> I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
<s> There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
<s> Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
<s> I know ...
<s> I want a divorce.
<s> The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
<s> De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
<s> No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
<s> Then I'll be there for you.
<s> Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
<s> Sometimes I think that's what you want.
<s> You.  What' you're doing --
<s> They were for me.  They're mine.
<s> No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
<s> Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
<s> Lost.
<s> Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
<s> How's that?
<s> I deduced it. Once you walked in.
<s> Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
<s> You don't know what he thinks.
<s> It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
<s> You figure him for a dope runner?
<s> I don't know...
<s> Gun out and up.
<s> I'm hidin' behind you.
<s> Sheriff?
<s> Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
<s> Okay.
<s> No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
<s> What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
<s> ...I need to sit down.
<s> Yes. Things fall into place.
<s> That'll work.
<s> Goin' out.
<s> Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
<s> Well -- how come?
<s> I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
<s> You know what's goin' on?
<s> She'll be all right.
<s> If you knew, you would have it with you.
<s> I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
<s> Step out of the car please, sir.
<s> In the truck.  I'll get it.
<s> Huh? Airport or airstrip?
<s> Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
<s> No. Do you?
<s> Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
<s> I see.
<s> I didn't mean nothin' by it.
<s> I don't know. Will there?
<s> Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
<s> Now is not a time. What time do you close.
<s> Sir?
<s> You live in that house behind the store?
<s> You married into it.
<s> I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
<s> No.
<s> Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
<s> There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
<s> Okay.
<s> That's not an answer.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
<s> You want to change rooms?
<s> That's got two double beds.
<s> I got beers in my room.
<s> I know what it is. He won't find me again.
<s> Not any way.
<s> I didn't say braze.
<s> So what does that make me? Your buddy?
<s> What product.
<s> He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
<s> I don't know. American citizens.
<s> No sir.
<s> I got an overcoat on.
<s> Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
<s> GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
<s> They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You said a woman couldn't have done it.
<s> I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
<s> She said she was in Arizona, did she?
<s> I know that...
<s> Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
<s> I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
<s> They're fine... you miss it?
<s> Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
<s> This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
<s> ...I... I know what you are.
<s> ...to see you.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
<s> It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
<s> I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
<s> He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
<s> I gotta go make dinner.
<s> Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
<s> Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
<s> There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
<s> Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
<s> Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
<s> It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
<s> ...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
<s> I ran back in to get the phone.
<s> What?
<s> I got you, Del...
<s> Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
<s> Roy! What are you doing here?
<s> Ahh, look, right now's not very...
<s> Los Angeles, California.
<s> I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
<s> What's his real name?
<s> Like Rome?
<s> You made out alright.
<s> No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
<s> He has no heartbeat!
<s> I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
<s> What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
<s> David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
<s> Who?
<s> I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
<s> Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
<s> He is real.
<s> To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
<s> Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
<s> I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
<s> There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
<s> No, that should be more than --
<s> Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
<s> Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
<s> No...
<s> I... I don't know...
<s> Beer, please.
<s> Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
<s> So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
<s> He told us it's in the Buick.
<s> I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
<s> You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
<s> Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
<s> Like... us?
<s> ...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
<s> They paid us half. They still owe us half...
<s> You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
<s> No.
<s> I said, 'No.' N-O.
<s> Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
<s> Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
<s> I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
<s> She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
<s> ...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
<s> ...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
<s> Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
<s> Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
<s> You better believe it.
<s> No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
<s> We know that...
<s> I said I'll think about it.
<s> Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
<s> What the hell's going on?
<s> No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
<s> That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
<s> Better.
<s> Would you say she was ambitious?
<s> Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
<s> Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
<s> Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
<s> Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
<s> "A Reason to Love."
<s> I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
<s> How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
<s> You mis'able little sneak thief...
<s> That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
<s> Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
<s> We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
<s> Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
<s> Okay, Pappy.
<s> Campaign manager? Waldrip.
<s> Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
<s> Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
<s> Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
<s> Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
<s> I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
<s> - in the gods - Huh?
<s> That wasn't my doing...
<s> For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
<s> Well that hardly sounds like you...
<s> ...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
<s> Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
<s> Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
<s> We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
<s> Thank you, sir!
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
<s> Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
<s> Naw. That's over with.
<s> Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
<s> Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
<s> Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
<s> Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
<s> It's important, sir!
<s> Well, goodbye.
<s> Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> Yes, sir!!
<s> But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
<s> Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
<s> He was. He died.
<s> That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
<s> Well, I'll be goddamned.
<s> Come on. Let's go dance.
<s> That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
<s> Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
<s> Not me.
<s> Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
<s> It sure was.
<s> I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
<s> God.
<s> Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
<s> Twenty-two years ago.
<s> I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
<s> I know that.
<s> He said he grew up poor?
<s> Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
<s> Sure.
<s> You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
<s> No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
<s> I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
<s> Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
<s> I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
<s> She didn't.
<s> I can't just...
<s> Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
<s> Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
<s> She better.
<s> You know how this gotta end.
<s> I know.
<s> That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
<s> Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
<s> Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
<s> She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Shut up and let me think.
<s> Do me a favor and don't talk.
<s> We'd like to come in.
<s> Oh, that phone call...
<s> Huh?
<s> The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
<s> Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
<s> KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
<s> It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
<s> It's just the woman and the kid?
<s> If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
<s> I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
<s> I don't think so, but I love her album.
<s> That room!
<s> PANIC ROOM!
<s> Shaky?
<s> Don't though. 
<s> Shhh...
<s> Yeah, but where's the third guy?
<s> He won't even know who it was.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I was trying not to tell you...
<s> Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
<s> What are doing with yours?.
<s> I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
<s> Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
<s> Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
<s> What's with you?
<s> Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
<s> What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
<s> Who? I mean besides the FBI?
<s> You know that's bullshit.
<s> Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
<s> No man. PE -- "political education."
<s> Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
<s> No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
<s> N... N...... Not... Oh.
<s> Can you make a deal with them?
<s> That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
<s> They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
<s> Are you finished?
<s> Jesus...
<s> ...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
<s> And did you witness the shoot-out?
<s> I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
<s> Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
<s> We're like policing the police.
<s> Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
<s> I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
<s> Yeah.
<s> So what's the deal?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah... let me think about it.
<s> Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
<s> Right on Brother Judge...
<s> Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
<s> Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
<s> Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
<s> And who is we?
<s> What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
<s> Nothing.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Bullshit...
<s> No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
<s> Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
<s> All of the above, man...  And then some.
<s> Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
<s> Where is he?.
<s> No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
<s> You don't look alright.
<s> I don't know. I really don't.
<s> It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Uh... uh... I...
<s> Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
<s> I said, I'm not my sister.
<s> My pleasure, sir.
<s> Apology accepted.
<s> As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
<s> Prisoner exchange.
<s> If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
<s> They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
<s> Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
<s> Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
<s> The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
<s> When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
<s> You're in no condition to ride.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
<s> Father?
<s> We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
<s> No...
<s> Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
<s> He left us.
<s> Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
<s> Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
<s> Balderdash!
<s> Thank you.
<s> Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
<s> Long time.
<s> You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
<s> Goodbye, Harry.
<s> I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
<s> But what about Thomas?
<s> Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
<s> Remember Braddock?
<s> Worse.
<s> But father, they might come this way.
<s> Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
<s> You'll see soon enough, hon.
<s> Bite?
<s> Well...I guess not.
<s> He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
<s> Am I really gonna have my own room?
<s> Yaay!
<s> Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
<s> Yayyy!
<s> For a little while.
<s> Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
<s> Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
<s> Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
<s> I hate that smell.
<s> That's enough, Ellen.
<s> No more chocolate chip cookies.
<s> Do you believe that?
<s> Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
<s> And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
<s> I swear.
<s> Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
<s> Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
<s> Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
<s> Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
<s> You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Does she love the cat?
<s> Then come on.
<s> Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
<s> Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
<s> Whose burying ground?
<s> Why? For God's sake, why?
<s> I guess so...but...
<s> Don't worry about that.
<s> Because it's right.
<s> What did we do, Jud?
<s> A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
<s> My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
<s> Shit! Look at this mess!
<s> You're doing fine.
<s> Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
<s> Louis, are you sure?
<s> You'll get it back.  Or one better.
<s> And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
<s> Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
<s> Wait as long as you like.
<s> Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
<s> Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
<s> I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
<s> Or you could surrender.
<s> Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
<s> One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
<s> Commodore, you can't do that!
<s> Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
<s> I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
<s> Then I can wear men's clothing.
<s> Yes -- yes.
<s> Ceremony?
<s> About the day we met. Do you remember?
<s> If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
<s> Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
<s> -- but that was not a proper kiss.
<s> Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
<s> I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
<s> No, I'm -- rescuing you.
<s> No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
<s> The trees are taller.
<s> Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
<s> Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
<s> Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
<s> What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
<s> You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
<s> Nor did you, I noticed.
<s> That he is.
<s> I know.  That was for the smell.
<s> Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
<s> How did he get off the island?
<s> Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
<s> The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
<s> As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
<s> Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
<s> Indeed.
<s> We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
<s> Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
<s> They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
<s> I'll be at the wheel myself.
<s> I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
<s> Pirate.
<s> No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
<s> 'Bootstrap?'
<s> That's not true.
<s> He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
<s> My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
<s> These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
<s> My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
<s> It's the right way.
<s> But I've seen a ship with black sails.
<s> He's not telling the truth.
<s> Please.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
<s> You mean besides kicking your ass?!
<s> That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
<s> Nebbleman.
<s> Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
<s> If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
<s> Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
<s> Considering what?
<s> Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> You don't want this.
<s> I want Trix!  Mommy!
<s> So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
<s> What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
<s> That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
<s> This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
<s> You're looking for a urine sample.
<s> Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
<s> And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
<s> You're insane.
<s> Daniel, what are you doing here?
<s> It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
<s> Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
<s> We don't?
<s> If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
<s> Got it.
<s> The waste.
<s> The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
<s> Just giving credit where credit is due.
<s> Blame the victim.
<s> I'm glad you came to me for help.
<s> I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
<s> What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
<s> Did you think I could just leave you...?
<s> Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
<s> And you have him?
<s> Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
<s> Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
<s> Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
<s> Dexter.
<s> Goodbye, Stew
<s> Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
<s> Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
<s> So, it's obvious, huh?
<s> Sure, I'll take a chance.
<s> For what?
<s> Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
<s> You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
<s> It isn't cheap. It's nice.
<s> Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
<s> Gallagher?
<s> Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
<s> Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
<s> Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
<s> Oh, shut up!
<s> Oh, man!
<s> Is that so?
<s> Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
<s> I certainly will.
<s> Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
<s> No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
<s> Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
<s> Well - it's only April.
<s> I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
<s> Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
<s> That's so.
<s> A what?
<s> Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
<s> I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
<s> Quite so. Quite.
<s> There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
<s> Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
<s> Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
<s> Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
<s> I hope you'll be very happy.
<s> Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
<s> Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
<s> Yes.
<s> Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
<s> Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
<s> Right.
<s> You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
<s> All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
<s> Very good.
<s> The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
<s> Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
<s> No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
<s> Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
<s> The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
<s> Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
<s> About what? Your marriage to Anne!
<s> All right, Grandma
<s> Have you seen this? 
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
<s> Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
<s> Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
<s> Sure.
<s> What?
<s> I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
<s> Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
<s> I won't.
<s> Thanks ... I love you.
<s> I'm sorry ...
<s> I've got to go ...
<s> No ...
<s> Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
<s> You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Yeah ... How'd you know?
<s> I'm fine--but thank you.
<s> Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
<s> Yes I did.
<s> Well--it was dark out ...
<s> Okay--that's enough!
<s> Oh. guess I could do that, then.
<s> What?
<s> Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
<s> No way.
<s> Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
<s> Get lost!
<s> What happened?
<s> You--you gotta get us out of here.
<s> I like--really need a cigarette, too.
<s> They don't notice that kind of thing.
<s> Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
<s> Nothing.
<s> The pages filled in?
<s> Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
<s> I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
<s> What?
<s> Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
<s> Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
<s> Rain.
<s> Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
<s> Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
<s> Yeah ... Sort of ...
<s> You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
<s> Ooomph?
<s> ... Hi.
<s> I can't.
<s> Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
<s> What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
<s> No you're not.
<s> Just gimme the damn remote!
<s> They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
<s> But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
<s> I'm so glad you're here.
<s> Forget about that!
<s> I brought you something ... From the library.
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
<s> Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
<s> You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
<s> Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
<s> I'm just stopping by to say hello.
<s> Why?
<s> ....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
<s> No.
<s> I feel really on the spot now.
<s> This is Georgia.
<s> I'm just laying on my bed.
<s> Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
<s> I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
<s> What do you mean it doesn't matter?
<s> You have a girlfriend?
<s> Where is she?
<s> Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
<s> You're going to work now?
<s> Can I ask you a question?
<s> No. I'm sorry.
<s> ....what....?
<s> I need help.
<s> I don't have a girlfriend --
<s> I didn't lie.
<s> This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
<s> This is not cool.
<s> She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Not very well.
<s> Hi.
<s> Are you guys hurt?
<s> Really?
<s> ...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing.
<s> You don't think you'll go --
<s> Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
<s> Ok.
<s> About six months ago. Why?
<s> For what?
<s> Ok, bye, bye.
<s> I know.
<s> Can I ask how much is this?
<s> ......and this is confidential?
<s> 337.....I'm sorry....
<s> I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
<s> Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
<s> YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
<s> We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
<s> My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
<s> ...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
<s> So what should I do with the pudding?
<s> I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
<s> Ok.
<s> Well....what do you want, then?
<s> This is a bunch of bullshit.
<s> You can't be late.
<s> Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
<s> I thought Latisha said you would --
<s> It's....whatever....that's not cool.
<s> Ok.
<s> Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
<s> Uch. Shut up, Dean.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Ok.
<s> He did seem a little strange.
<s> Should I call you later?
<s> We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
<s> For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
<s> "With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
<s> We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
<s> It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
<s> What? What've I done?
<s> You'll hate me now, won't you?
<s> Do I have your word?
<s> I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
<s> Coulmier, you animal!
<s> I know, because I felt it myself --
<s> You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
<s> Why was it you never took her by force?
<s> Then it must've been love --
<s> And his writing?
<s> All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
<s> A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
<s> And place my reputation at stake?
<s> Oh indeed?
<s> It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
<s> And my own.
<s> I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
<s> Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
<s> Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
<s> Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
<s> Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
<s> What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
<s> Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
<s> Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
<s> Go on, child.
<s> Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
<s> Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
<s> Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
<s> And I in yours.
<s> How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
<s> They've put you up to this, haven't they?
<s> Not you too
<s> Am I?
<s> She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
<s> Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
<s> You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
<s> My name is Orson Welles
<s> Over at RKO?
<s> Don't
<s> How much?
<s> Yes.
<s> Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
<s> I will not defend my life to you--
<s> There is nothing to discuss-
<s> I wanted it
<s> Not for me.
<s> You will not walk out on me
<s> Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
<s> I don't want you to--
<s> Sir? 
<s> Sir?
<s> "You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
<s> He personally asked you to?
<s> Oh for God's sake, Louella-
<s> Can I talk to Hearst?
<s> All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
<s> Telling stories.
<s> You're a laugh-riot, kid.
<s> Right-
<s> Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
<s> Who the hell's Manolete?
<s> We're doing Hearst.
<s> Listen to me-
<s> Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
<s> No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
<s> Jews. She's talking about Jews.
<s> It's too late. The movie's made
<s> Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
<s> Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
<s> As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
<s> And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
<s> Yes
<s> Get out.
<s> When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
<s> You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
<s> It's just that my movie is so-
<s> That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
<s> No, we're jake. But listen-
<s> I don't want to sit
<s> Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
<s> Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
<s> I'm Christ
<s> How can he embarrass you?
<s> Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
<s> See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
<s> I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
<s> No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
<s> Yeah, she's nice.
<s> Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
<s> I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
<s> Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
<s> You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
<s> What?
<s> I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
<s> You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
<s> Whadda ya mean?
<s> I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
<s> What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
<s> Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
<s> What time is it?
<s> At night?
<s> I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
<s> Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
<s> Come over here.
<s> If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
<s> Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
<s> No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
<s> Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, what?
<s> You're hurting my arm.
<s> Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
<s> I went to the movies.
<s> Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
<s> Yeah --
<s> Why don't you just call him?
<s> I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
<s> Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
<s> Don't make no difference no more.
<s> Yeah, the weight's Ok.
<s> I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
<s> Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
<s> What time?
<s> Give him evidence.
<s> What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
<s> Oh -- I almost forgot!
<s> Mrs. Thorwald.
<s> You think he's getting out of here?
<s> Congratulations, Jeff.
<s> Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
<s> I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
<s> Did you get my note?
<s> Well, I only quote from the best.
<s> Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
<s> Stella!
<s> I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
<s> Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
<s> Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
<s> That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
<s> How did you know!
<s> She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
<s> Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
<s> Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
<s> Got a shovel?
<s> To bail Lisa out of jail.
<s> He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
<s> Empty as a football.
<s> Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
<s> I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
<s> That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
<s> Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
<s> No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
<s> Something too frightful to utter.
<s> There's nothing to see.
<s> You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
<s> What's the apartment house number?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Thinking about Thorwald?
<s> Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
<s> Inside stuff?
<s> Night. I'm going to stay with you.
<s> I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
<s> It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
<s> You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
<s> Who was the trunk addressed to?
<s> Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
<s> I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
<s> It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
<s> Too close.
<s> And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
<s> Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
<s> Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
<s> Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
<s> A new disease.
<s> What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
<s> Give me some dirt.
<s> I'm cute, too.
<s> What?
<s> Know the Millertown bluff?
<s> Stay there.
<s> I think I should go home.
<s> Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
<s> Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
<s> You make any sandwiches?
<s> Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
<s> Will you wait a minute?
<s> You don't?
<s> He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
<s> Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
<s> A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
<s> Just relax, please relax!
<s> That's right!
<s> He's home.  I heard the car.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
<s> Well maybe she better start.
<s> Look--can't you see I'm writing?
<s> My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
<s> Hi there.
<s> What?
<s> If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
<s> Yeah?
<s> It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
<s> Your father!
<s> I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
<s> I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
<s> All right, darling.
<s> Goodbye, dear.
<s> I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
<s> Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
<s> Bully for you.
<s> Who lives?
<s> Dig the square wardrobe!
<s> A what?
<s> You were looking for me, weren't you?
<s> Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
<s> Have you ever gone with anyone who--
<s> There's just one thing.  What about--
<s> Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
<s> So do you.
<s> Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
<s> Talk to them!  Heavens!
<s> Hi.
<s> He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
<s> What?
<s> Gabriel!
<s> YES!!!
<s> ...whoever she is.
<s> He'll be dead when he does.
<s> C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Radio said.
<s> I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
<s> Then he shoulda signed his name.
<s> Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
<s> Ash, you've gotten me enough --
<s> He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
<s> You're not hearing me here --
<s> You're in on this.
<s> I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
<s> But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
<s> No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
<s> What?
<s> They're truck drivers.
<s> Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
<s> Part of... with them?
<s> I'm almost done.
<s> You shouldn't have.
<s> The hell I can't.
<s> I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
<s> I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
<s> I never worked at no casino.
<s> Wish I had a brother like you.
<s> J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
<s> Bam Bam.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I said, who the hell made the map?
<s> And I worked there. For a year.
<s> When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
<s> You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
<s> Put it on.
<s> Don't tip.
<s> ...never... tried...
<s> Nothing... I promise-nothing...
<s> We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
<s> I'm no threat without a gun.
<s> Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
<s> What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
<s> And where they hide the real money.
<s> Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
<s> Show's over.
<s> GO!!!
<s> We're aware of your position.
<s> Mr. Bangs.
<s> His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
<s> What?
<s> That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
<s> Hi, Nick.
<s> I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
<s> How do we do that?
<s> Where the hell's Gabriel?
<s> It's a roach, guy --
<s> Fuckin, Zookerman --
<s> Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
<s> Ain't there yet.
<s> And a slice of pecan pie, right?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
<s> I'm just talking.
<s> No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
<s> Standing right here, man!
<s> YOU TELL HER!
<s> Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
<s> There is no other table --
<s> Who the hell made this map.
<s> Thanks, don't mind if I do.
<s> First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
<s> Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
<s> You ain't dying, he is.
<s> Where was she from, Compton?
<s> Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
<s> Really? Who's your P.O.?
<s> And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
<s> We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
<s> I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
<s> Pam Grier.
<s> Yeah.
<s> A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
<s> I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
<s> What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
<s> Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
<s> I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
<s> What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
<s> Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
<s> Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
<s> How many employees?
<s> Juicy, junior, real juicy.
<s> Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
<s> Don't ask me that.
<s> Mr. Pink.
<s> He don't believe in it.
<s> I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
<s> We think we got a rat in the house.
<s> That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
<s> It's a surprise.
<s> All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
<s> I can' take you to a hospital.
<s> Uh-uh. I don't tip.
<s> Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
<s> You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
<s> Fuck all that.
<s> Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
<s> Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
<s> You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
<s> That's not correct.
<s> A few cops.
<s> That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
<s> You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
<s> That was the plan, we meet here.
<s> I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
<s> I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
<s> Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
<s> Well, he knows a little about me.
<s> He asked.
<s> Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
<s> I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
<s> Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
<s> As far as -- Sonora?
<s> I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
<s> I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
<s> It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
<s> Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
<s> No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
<s> I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
<s> Go on. Tell me more about her.
<s> That's fine.
<s> It's too light yet.
<s> You're not going out to look for them?
<s> Maybe it's better that way.
<s> I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
<s> All right -- it's said!
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> It's going to Sonora.
<s> Hurry up.
<s> Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
<s> Hello, Miss Wells.
<s> You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
<s> A little hot.
<s> A man I used to know.
<s> I don't want to run short.
<s> You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
<s> All right. I'll tell you.
<s> And meet him there.
<s> You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
<s> That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
<s> Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
<s> You want to split up? --
<s> What's there to be fair about?
<s> All right, you didn't know.
<s> Nobody asked you to.
<s> If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
<s> Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
<s> No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
<s> That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
<s> And we're running out of that.
<s> No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
<s> He certainly could. About a month.
<s> You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
<s> Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
<s> I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
<s> Since I can remember, Ma'am.
<s> Don't you even know your letters?
<s> Good night, Steve.
<s> From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
<s> There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
<s> Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
<s> No.
<s> But you're his brother.
<s> Thanks, Steve.
<s> Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
<s> Okay... maybe that would be best.
<s> Never happened!
<s> Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
<s> Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
<s> What?! What is it, a monster?!
<s> Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
<s> Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
<s> Hello Ray.
<s> Ray, have you been here all this time?
<s> Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
<s> Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
<s> Okay.
<s> Thanks. I'm Cindy.
<s> No. I never date outside my race.
<s> Shhh!
<s> Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
<s> Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
<s> Can you feel that?
<s> No. Keep rubbing.
<s> Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
<s> That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
<s> Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
<s> It's okay.
<s> I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
<s> Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
<s> Quick, everyone to the lab.
<s> We? What do you mean... we?
<s> Gear. You know, clothing.
<s> I wouldn't go that far.
<s> Saw who?!
<s> Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
<s> Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
<s> How are we going to get them all up there?
<s> Fine.  What's all this stuff?
<s> That one.
<s> Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
<s> Are you sure it's not the tape?
<s> Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
<s> It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
<s> Just a little experiment.
<s> And sexy.
<s> My help?
<s> My holy water.
<s> Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
<s> Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
<s> Aww. Cool. Dude.
<s> "Fucked me."
<s> Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
<s> It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
<s> I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
<s> Always the dentist.
<s> There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
<s> I'm so happy I could shit.
<s> But, Chip...
<s> You mean for TV or print?
<s> And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
<s> That's nice.
<s> We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
<s> Oooohhhh.
<s> Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
<s> Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
<s> Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
<s> Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
<s> Socially... I'll have a beer.
<s> Let the record show I'm just standing here.
<s> NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
<s> Yes, I was.
<s> I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
<s> You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
<s> I do, please.
<s> It's sugarless.
<s> We all have bad nights. 
<s> Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
<s> But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
<s> If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
<s> NO! I could never hurt anyone!
<s> Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
<s> From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
<s> Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
<s> Yes. She bought my sister's business.
<s> If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
<s> Thank you.
<s> As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.
<s> She can only use cash.
<s> For the time being, I imagine that must do.
<s> Hello, Frances.
<s> "The Dante?"
<s> Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
<s> Thank you.
<s> But you have treated me that way.
<s> A job?
<s> Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
<s> Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
<s> It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
<s> We could tell him.
<s> I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
<s> Why wait?
<s> You will die.
<s> You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm at sea, Jason.
<s> I can imagine.
<s> Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
<s> Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
<s> We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
<s> I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
<s> But why come to me?
<s> I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
<s> Why not let your publisher judge that?
<s> Tell me what?
<s> I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
<s> They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
<s> Cloven hoof?
<s> It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
<s> It seems right to us.
<s> Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
<s> I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
<s> A gay lot - Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
<s> No. She's no longer under my care.
<s> I never thought you did.
<s> Thank you, my dear.
<s> This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
<s> She's not been here for a long time.
<s> No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
<s> What?
<s> It won't hurt.
<s> No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
<s> Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
<s> Nine years.
<s> Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
<s> I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
<s> It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
<s> Agreed.
<s> I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
<s> Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
<s> Nothing I can't finish later.
<s> You went out with her?
<s> All of these are interviews?
<s> Everything about sex.
<s> Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
<s> I'm sorry this came up.
<s> Maybe you want to go.
<s> I know.
<s> I know.
<s> She said it on her tape.
<s> Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
<s> Don't you want to make one?
<s> Ann Bishop Millaney.
<s> When we're making love?
<s> At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
<s> Why?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> You said you weren't always impotent.
<s> Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
<s> I'm babbling.
<s> I'm not in love with you.
<s> I... I can't answer that precisely.
<s> But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Possibly.
<s> Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
<s> And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
<s> No.
<s> Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
<s> Well, are you?
<s> If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
<s> You've made your point.
<s> Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
<s> I want out of this marriage.
<s> I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
<s> No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Did you confront John about the visitor?
<s> Did you find him attractive?
<s> What do you mean? I don't understand.
<s> But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
<s> Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
<s> Well, I wonder why.
<s> I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
<s> Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
<s> Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
<s> Why did you do that?
<s> You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
<s> You are in serious trouble.
<s> I don't want to discuss it.
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
<s> Nope.
<s> That's all.
<s> I turn on the camera. You start talking.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
<s> Very much live.
<s> Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
<s> Yes.
<s> Different.
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
<s> I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
<s> Cynthia. John.
<s> I like the way he dresses.
<s> You told Ann about this?
<s> What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
<s> My keys?
<s> Hi. Want a drink?
<s> Was he nice to you?
<s> No, nothing.
<s> I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
<s> That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
<s> Uh, OK. Sure.
<s> OK. But late.
<s> What do you want to call me at the office for?
<s> Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
<s> We live in 703.
<s> You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
<s> Who was she?
<s> No? How come?
<s> Lemme clarify for you.
<s> A wreck.
<s> What's cookin', Bert?
<s> What?
<s> I got it!  I got it!!!
<s> After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
<s> No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
<s> Who trusts experts?
<s> Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
<s> Now Betty, don't overreact.
<s> Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
<s> Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
<s> Indulge?
<s> I don't want to get up there.
<s> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
<s> I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
<s> THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
<s> Absolutely correct.
<s> Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
<s> Of course.
<s> Who?
<s> Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
<s> Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
<s> I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
<s> Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
<s> Fast!
<s> Foods!
<s> We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
<s> What does he know about it?
<s> In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
<s> ...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
<s> You guys having fun?
<s> Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
<s> I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
<s> Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
<s> So I guess that's it.
<s> Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
<s> Bottle.
<s> A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
<s> Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
<s> In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
<s> No, I'm an actor.
<s> I am one of those guys.
<s> No, we're paying for the wine.
<s> You said you had it all lined up.
<s> Yeah, Conundrum.
<s> 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
<s> Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
<s> Oh yeah. Much better.
<s> Um... seventy... something.
<s> It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
<s> I'd rather have a knife.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
<s> And Lexapro, yes.
<s> I thought you hated Chardonnay.
<s> I told you. Filet and salmon.
<s> Let me call Christine.
<s> Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
<s> Huh.
<s> Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
<s> Yeah, that would be a good move.
<s> It's not even a mile.
<s> Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
<s> Whoa.
<s> Pour us a couple.
<s> She is very hot.
<s> You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
<s> Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
<s> Beautiful.
<s> Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
<s> Well, she is cute.
<s> Aye-aye, captain.
<s> If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
<s> Okay! Fuck!
<s> I'm fine!
<s> Okay! Jesus!
<s> What?
<s> What? Of course I like Christine.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nope.
<s> Could be anything.
<s> What exactly are we going to do?
<s> No.
<s> It's private.
<s> Let's leave it alone.
<s> Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
<s> Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
<s> Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
<s> Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
<s> No way. No way.
<s> Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
<s> Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
<s> Hrnrnrn?
<s> Quite a week.
<s> Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
<s> I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
<s> Back at you.
<s> You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
<s> Hey.
<s> Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
<s> Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
<s> Yeah. Definitely.
<s> So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
<s> My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
<s> It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
<s> Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
<s> A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
<s> This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
<s> I told you I need a drink.
<s> Quaffable but far from transcendent.
<s> Exactement!
<s> We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
<s> Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
<s> Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
<s> Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
<s> Where?
<s> Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
<s> Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
<s> And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
<s> Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
<s> Don't touch him.
<s> Who said I was going to die?
<s> ...I will.
<s> You got two minor league home run records don't you?
<s> I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
<s> It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
<s> That's right.
<s> I got him.
<s> That wasn't the answer you wanted?
<s> What's furry, furry rabbit?
<s> Should we make a run for it out the back?
<s> Got it!
<s> Have they said anything about our area?
<s> I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
<s> Me too.
<s> That means they're unemployed.
<s> I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
<s> Don't call me Father.
<s> Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
<s> You take care of yourself...  Graham.
<s> Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> What book!
<s> Your next water ain't for three days.
<s> It was my fault.
<s> Where's Jake?
<s> Have you thought at all about your plans?
<s> No, Leavenworth.
<s> Looks like that's not all they admired.
<s> Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
<s> Going to Turley, was it?
<s> You haven't got any money.
<s> Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
<s> Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
<s> Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
<s> I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
<s> Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
<s> Why?
<s> What now?
<s> What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
<s> Really?
<s> I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Who did it?
<s> Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
<s> He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
<s> Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
<s> Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
<s> I just got to town.
<s> I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
<s> Thanks. That's what I call it too.
<s> So-called?
<s> Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
<s> I wouldn't worry about that.
<s> Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
<s> I am telling the truth.
<s> I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
<s> I'm glad we talked.
<s> -- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
<s> You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
<s> So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
<s> Out of the question.  A circus like that?
<s> If it's on the page...
<s> Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
<s> She said you were very beautiful.
<s> Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
<s> No.
<s> No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
<s> Excuse me?  Start?
<s> She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
<s> Not if I don't let her.
<s> Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
<s> Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
<s> He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
<s> You don't secretly want the attention?
<s> It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
<s> Clyde.
<s> But she's right there!  I must feel her!
<s> I was misquoted.
<s> That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> -- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
<s> I do.
<s> Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
<s> I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
<s> I do okay.  How about you?
<s> I know.  Thank her for me.
<s> No, that was me.
<s> Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
<s> It's a yacht.
<s> I'm keeping it in trust.
<s> I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
<s> She looks a lot like you.
<s> That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
<s> You're in breach.
<s> It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
<s> Yes, I'd like that.
<s> But that's Simone's part.
<s> Good.
<s> Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
<s> I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
<s> Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
<s> No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
<s> You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
<s> What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
<s> I didn't leave you.
<s> Goodnight, sweetheart.
<s> No, just one.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> How do you draw now?
<s> I guess they don't.
<s> See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
<s> That I'm a freak.
<s> Never mind.
<s> And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
<s> Don't fail me.
<s> Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
<s> Yes, it did.
<s> You do?
<s> I definitely won't.
<s> Oh.
<s> You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
<s> Don't get mad.
<s> They did?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Got it.
<s> Like what?
<s> You're a stuttering Stanley!
<s> Who!
<s> Meaning?
<s> Superstition.
<s> You were a beat and a quarter behind.
<s> Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
<s> You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
<s> Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
<s> Someone actually... employs you?
<s> Not lately.
<s> You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
<s> Book of Jeremiah.
<s> Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
<s> Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
<s> -- "Billy-Jean" --
<s> I thought you said two hundred.
<s> Manure... is life.
<s> Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
<s> This is his room... isn't it?
<s> -- It's not me!
<s> I --
<s> I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
<s> Who you callin' "boy?"
<s> What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
<s> He's right. You were behind.
<s> Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
<s> Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
<s> Yeah?
<s> When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
<s> Look. You want to talk about this?
<s> Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
<s> I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
<s> You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
<s> Never.
<s> Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
<s> That's not funny.
<s> I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
<s> He tried to kill you, Starla.
<s> Okay.
<s> What do you see? I see a butterfly.
<s> Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
<s> Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
<s> What can I do you for?
<s> That's disrespectful.
<s> Out.
<s> You're pretty.
<s> Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
<s> Grant, no!
<s> What other stuff?
<s> Gold--digger, huh?
<s> 'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
<s> Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
<s> Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
<s> You know how rumors start.
<s> Last year, this was a new rig.
<s> You paying for the gas?
<s> All sound reasons for matrimony.
<s> I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
<s> Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
<s> I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
<s> Eleven.
<s> Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
<s> He's after us again!
<s> I would've come back for you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Like what?
<s> Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
<s> How do you know?
<s> It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
<s> The minute you see him, you'll know.
<s> Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
<s> Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
<s> No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
<s> Running blocker.
<s> Twenty-one is nineteen.
<s> Redneck heaven.
<s> Forty-two minutes ahead.
<s> What's your twenty?
<s> We're gone.
<s> I'll believe it when I see it.
<s> Yeah, but...
<s> But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
<s> What's your twenty and what's your handle?
<s> Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
<s> That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
<s> Chickenshit money.
<s> -- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
<s> -- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
<s> Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
<s> Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
<s> Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
<s> Mortal.
<s> I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
<s> I'm not doing cocaine.
<s> Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
<s> Your attitude sucks.
<s> I said I got his machine.
<s> Okay.
<s> That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
<s> -- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
<s> Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
<s> -- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
<s> Nah, nuthin' on my end --
<s> I'm here.
<s> Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
<s> Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
<s> Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
<s> None whatsoever.
<s> Yeah... Sid?
<s> Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
<s> I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
<s> What are we talkin' on the split...
<s> The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
<s> C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
<s> What's the time frame?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Can it work?
<s> You're not Gibarian...
<s> Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
<s> We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
<s> Who was it?
<s> What was it?
<s> I wish you'd told me.
<s> -- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
<s> But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
<s> She drank liquid oxygen.
<s> She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
<s> To calm your anxiety.
<s> I want you inside me right now.
<s> You didn't look very happy.
<s> Let's go home.
<s> Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
<s> You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
<s> You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
<s> How old were you?
<s> It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
<s> How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
<s> You... she said I didn't love her.
<s> No.  I love you.
<s> For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
<s> I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
<s> I never said I didn't.
<s> I want to stop taking those pills.
<s> When?
<s> We want to talk freely.
<s> Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
<s> Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
<s> I'm not Snow.
<s> You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
<s> Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
<s> He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
<s> Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
<s> Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
<s> You don't like him, do you?
<s> They called here after you left...
<s> This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
<s> Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
<s> I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
<s> Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
<s> I know.
<s> "To"... Forget about you.
<s> It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
<s> Mike...?
<s> I think it's probably still a good idea.
<s> Listen, I'll... see you again.
<s> You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
<s> You take care.
<s> Just putting in an appearance then.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Sure we are, let's go!
<s> Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
<s> Your what...?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Get in bed.
<s> You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
<s> You got no idea...
<s> I think television's a dangerous thing.
<s> I had to follow her to a store.
<s> Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
<s> You heard me.
<s> What're you talking about --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
<s> You talked to his wife?
<s> Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
<s> What about Tommy?
<s> No.
<s> Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
<s> It should've been me...
<s> Right behind you, T.J.
<s> Ever shot anyone?
<s> No, sir...
<s> That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
<s> I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
<s> That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
<s> My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
<s> Lay back, Mack.
<s> Mom and I got plans.
<s> I don't think she can sing, either.
<s> Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
<s> Remember Little League?
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> I was sort of hoping to get out of--
<s> I know.  I've got one too.
<s> Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
<s> I think you're trying to tell me something.
<s> Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
<s> Thanks, I already ate.
<s> Well...
<s> Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
<s> Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
<s> You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
<s> No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
<s> I know what you mean.  I...
<s> Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
<s> Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
<s> I'm here...
<s> Nah.
<s> --but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
<s> You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
<s> Aunt May, what happened?
<s> How is he?
<s> Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
<s> I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
<s> I will finish what I've begun
<s> Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
<s> Hi, Professor.  What's up?
<s> An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
<s> Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
<s> Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
<s> Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
<s> The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
<s> Phooey on that.
<s> I wouldn't talk about things like that.
<s> Any news on Dunbar?
<s> Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
<s> Static!
<s> Who is it?
<s> Anybody here wanna double their bet?
<s> Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
<s> Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
<s> Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
<s> My legs are frozen.
<s> Abfuehren!
<s> Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
<s> They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
<s> What exactly is he charged with?
<s> Why do you do this to me every morning?
<s> Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
<s> I don't care if they wear galoshes!
<s> Me? What if she don't want me?
<s> Where'd that come from?
<s> It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
<s> He's the grrrrreatest!
<s> Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
<s> She'll never forgive me!
<s> So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
<s> Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
<s> Do Jimmy Durante!
<s> You want to go?
<s> Anything else?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
<s> Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
<s> And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
<s> Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
<s> You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
<s> What's the decoy?
<s> Just what makes you so popular?
<s> They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
<s> Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
<s> Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
<s> The Germans know where Dunbar is.
<s> What time?
<s> You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
<s> All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
<s> Ich weiss alles.
<s> You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
<s> Who's the guy, Schulz?
<s> No! No!
<s> We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
<s> Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
<s> Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
<s> When is it expected back?
<s> The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
<s> I believe so.
<s> I believe so.
<s> Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
<s> Commander.
<s> I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
<s> All hands, brace for impact!
<s> I'll go. You have the Bridge.
<s> Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
<s> Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
<s> You're in the Nexus.
<s> What makes you think things will be any different this time?
<s> Oh, of course.
<s> No, no. Thank you.
<s> Better?
<s> That's right.
<s> I thought you might.
<s> Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
<s> No. Thank you.
<s> You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
<s> As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
<s> What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
<s> Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
<s> You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
<s> And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
<s> Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
<s> David... Sorry I'm late.
<s> David!... What went wrong?
<s> ... Or <u>who</u>.
<s> But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
<s> I have already made one transmission too many...
<s> Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
<s> You said there wouldn't be any.
<s> I'll try to remember that, Captain.
<s> Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
<s> Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
<s> Just him, sir!
<s> Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
<s> FULL IMPULSE POWER!
<s> No, sir, no response.
<s> Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
<s> Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
<s> 
<s> I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
<s> Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
<s> Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
<s> ... The needs of the few...
<s> But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
<s> Yes, my lord!
<s> 
<s> You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
<s> I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
<s> I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
<s> Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
<s> Exactly. Happy birthday.
<s> Amazing! I don't know what to say --
<s> Thank you.
<s> Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
<s> Ah.
<s> Young. I feel young, Doctor.
<s> I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
<s> Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
<s> The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
<s> Mother, go back!
<s> Go back. I'm going to kill him.
<s> I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
<s> Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
<s> I see. Helmsman?
<s> We appear to have plenty of time.
<s> Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
<s> But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
<s> Only half of you would get there.
<s> Locking phasers on target.
<s> We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
<s> Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
<s> ... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
<s> Here it comes. Now, Spock.
<s> KHAN!
<s> Listen to me -- you men and women --
<s> Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
<s> Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
<s> I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
<s> My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
<s> Yes, SIR.
<s> She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
<s> That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
<s> Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
<s> At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
<s> Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
<s> Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
<s> Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
<s> Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
<s> You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
<s> Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
<s> Take the test again.
<s> Who?
<s> They just don't want us going in there.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Two minutes, ten seconds.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
<s> I exaggerated.
<s> Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
<s> ... They do, indeed.
<s> I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
<s> Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
<s> Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
<s> We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
<s> It'll come back to him.
<s> Would you prefer to do nothing?
<s> -- That's the general idea.
<s> Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
<s> Come on, Pavel...
<s> Not me, Bones... They did it.
<s> Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
<s> Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
<s> Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
<s> My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
<s> Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
<s> It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
<s> Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
<s> Like what?
<s> I'm wery sorry, but --
<s> I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
<s> And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
<s> We are launching everything we have.
<s> It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
<s> How soon?
<s> I buy that. What about him?
<s> You've already been that. C'mon.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
<s> It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
<s> What's what?
<s> Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
<s> You want the details?
<s> But Kirk...
<s> He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
<s> ... You have a point...
<s> To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
<s> The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
<s> The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
<s> That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
<s> There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
<s> What are the variables...?
<s> You've programmed that from memory...?
<s> Yes?
<s> Exaggerate.
<s> I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
<s> How will playing cards help?
<s> He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
<s> In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
<s> Thank you, Spock.
<s> Right.  Will you help us?
<s> Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
<s> I will, Admiral.
<s> From a city? That doesn't make sense....
<s> On screen.
<s> Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
<s> Two?
<s> Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
<s> Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
<s> On my way...!
<s> No power to the bay doors.
<s> Admiral, you'll be trapped!
<s> Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
<s> You will be in good hands here.
<s> Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
<s> Millions?
<s> I demand to see the owners! I demand --
<s> Well, that's different.
<s> That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
<s> ... Are you joking?
<s> Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
<s> It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
<s> Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
<s> It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
<s> You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
<s> This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
<s> There are caves in those mountains.
<s> You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
<s> I'll be here.
<s> Perhaps, that is true.
<s> My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
<s> Really?
<s> But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
<s> No.
<s> It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
<s> How about a passive radiation scan?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
<s> He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
<s> You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
<s> How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
<s> There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
<s> Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
<s> Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
<s> Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
<s> Do you know how to disable the injector?
<s> No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
<s> They... are in opposite directions, sir...
<s> And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
<s> Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
<s> Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
<s> We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
<s> We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
<s> Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
<s> Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
<s> Beam him out!
<s> Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
<s> No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
<s> I'm not letting go of him.
<s> No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
<s> Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
<s> Was I doing something to your neck?
<s> Or you could try lying down.
<s> It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
<s> We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
<s> Yes...
<s> I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
<s> I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
<s> How did Doctor Almack react to that?
<s> If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
<s> Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
<s> Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
<s> A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
<s> Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
<s> Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
<s> What?
<s> Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
<s> I told you, there's no --
<s> Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
<s> We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
<s> Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
<s> There's a red light on the second intake valve.
<s> I'm on it...
<s> Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
<s> Great name. French?
<s> These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
<s> Yes, he is.
<s> Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
<s> You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
<s> A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
<s> No. It's a lot further than that.
<s> On screen.
<s> Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
<s> We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
<s> Western hemisphere... North American continent...
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
<s> Go to manual.
<s> Fire!
<s> Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
<s> We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
<s> They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
<s> We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
<s> The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
<s> Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
<s> Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
<s> Commander... we have a problem.
<s> Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
<s> There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
<s> Bones, are you afraid of the future?
<s> No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
<s> Don't remind me.
<s> No way.  You see this?
<s> That cunning little Vulcan...
<s> Barely.
<s> There... were no other ships in the sector.
<s> Those words WERE spoken by me.
<s> Your honors, the State rests.
<s> Uhura, monitor!
<s> Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
<s> First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
<s> Who else?
<s> Aye, sir; thrusters...
<s> Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
<s> Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
<s> Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
<s> Energize...
<s> Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
<s> Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
<s> I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
<s> When does this conference start?
<s> Thank you, Captain Sulu.
<s> There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
<s> I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
<s> Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
<s> Make ourselves a target?
<s> I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
<s> Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
<s> Who else?
<s> Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
<s> In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
<s> We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
<s> We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
<s> Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
<s> Visual!
<s> We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
<s> Nevertheless.
<s> Aye, aye, sir.
<s> How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
<s> What exactly does that mean?
<s> Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
<s> Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
<s> But you didn't join a conspiracy.
<s> I am in a room with lights.
<s> Can you describe it, Deanna?
<s> Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
<s> It would appear so.
<s> It'll only work for one of us.
<s> Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
<s> Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
<s> An individual more like you, you mean.
<s> Emergency force fields are holding.
<s> The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
<s> Do you have a moment, sir?
<s> You're speaking of emotional investment?
<s> And I you.
<s> Counselor?
<s> Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
<s> This isn't real.
<s> I can feel your desire, Deanna.
<s> Do you have life support?
<s> Understood.
<s> Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
<s> And that's exactly what he's going to do.
<s> Ready, sir!
<s> I'll take care of it, sir.
<s> There's more... as always. He's Reman.
<s> There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
<s> Wont do what, Mister Worf?
<s> Aye, sir
<s> Your new chair, sir.
<s> Thank you, sir...
<s> Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
<s> I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
<s> Yes.
<s> Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
<s> What happened?
<s> And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
<s> Age before rank, Jean Luc.
<s> I always hoped I would hit two meters.
<s> Why am I here?
<s> You're not Reman.
<s> I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
<s> You know that's not possible.
<s> Please.
<s> Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Yes, Praetor.
<s> My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
<s> Silence, Romulan!
<s> And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
<s> How much are your rooms?
<s> Sure.
<s> I understand.
<s> No.
<s> It is beautiful.
<s> Stay right there...
<s> Elmo's...
<s> About five miles back.
<s> Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
<s> What do you mean by 'contain?'
<s> When can we expect containment?
<s> I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
<s> Shermin...
<s> You're not hearing me.
<s> You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
<s> What?
<s> This is George Fox...
<s> I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
<s> Don't... don't do this... please...
<s> What.
<s> Eh... police.
<s> Good.
<s> We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> No gas.
<s> I am Jenny Haydn.
<s> Space?
<s> Shit... shit... what shit?
<s> You. Mouth closed.
<s> This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
<s> Shit!
<s> Horses.
<s> Music.
<s> You better.
<s> I need you.
<s> Why?
<s> The car will stop?
<s> Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
<s> I was afraid.
<s> It was a mistake.
<s> Are you my friend?
<s> Yes.
<s> I do not want to.
<s> No. Get in.
<s> I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
<s> You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
<s> Come on.
<s> I must meet my ship.
<s> You promised you would get me to my ship.
<s> Horses.
<s> No.
<s> Do they talk?!
<s> Yes, they are.
<s> I know how to gamble now.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Where?
<s> Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
<s> I will.
<s> Call the police!!
<s> Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
<s> He doesn't understand... just walk away...
<s> My grandmother's rich.
<s> If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
<s> Give it a rest, Lyman.
<s> Doesn't make sense.
<s> I did.
<s> Bullshit!
<s> Very beautiful country up here...
<s> Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
<s> People have made mistakes in these situations before.
<s> It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
<s> Hey, fuck you, man.
<s> Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
<s> What're you going to do?
<s> Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
<s> Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
<s> A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
<s> Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
<s> Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
<s> Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
<s> Shutup a second!
<s> Not now... I don't want to think about it--
<s> He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
<s> Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
<s> I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
<s> You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
<s> Okay... what about Strickland?
<s> What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
<s> Jesus!
<s> That's pretty much the way it happened.
<s> And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
<s> Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
<s> I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
<s> Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
<s> Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
<s> Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
<s> Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
<s> What?
<s> Who was just here?
<s> Faith, can I talk to you a second?
<s> Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
<s> Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
<s> Sleaze to peddle.
<s> Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
<s> Fumitsu.
<s> It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
<s> Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
<s> Wants to share.
<s> Now you're really getting paranoid.
<s> This tie doesn't go with blue!
<s> Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
<s> Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
<s> Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
<s> I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
<s> Yeah, right, blow it open.
<s> You never told me.
<s> No, it's not.
<s> Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
<s> Aw, Mom!
<s> Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
<s> Take the tape to the cops.
<s> Um... he was older.
<s> Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
<s> Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
<s> Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
<s> I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
<s> Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
<s> You're thinking...?
<s> This isn't in our database?
<s> I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
<s> It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> He had an orange hat on.
<s> What about his killer?
<s> Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
<s> Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
<s> He got away. I had him. He got away.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
<s> "Was?"
<s> Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
<s> Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
<s> They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
<s> How long have you been downtown?
<s> Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
<s> Where's my watch? It's gone.
<s> This is some serious shit.
<s> You got a point there.
<s> And one other thing.
<s> My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
<s> He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
<s> Huh?
<s> Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
<s> Does Koessler ask about me?
<s> What did you tell him?
<s> Not about coming to see Daitz?
<s> Sue Ann Hanson.
<s> No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
<s> Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
<s> But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
<s> Koessler doesn't know any of this?
<s> But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
<s> It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
<s> How are we going to find him?
<s> No weapon.
<s> The little piggie speaks.
<s> I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
<s> You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
<s> The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
<s> I already have an employer.
<s> Maybe you should back off.
<s> You? You went by the book?
<s> Lead the way, Murman.
<s> [And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
<s> So you're the new meat?
<s> Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
<s> You're right. I know.
<s> You're money, baby.
<s> I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
<s> I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
<s> Yes. Like the quiche.
<s> Tell me about it...
<s> Yeah.
<s> No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
<s> Why not? This place is dead anyway.
<s> What else is going on?
<s> No matter what... like splitting aces.
<s> I'm a "Dorothy".
<s> I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
<s> Six years.
<s> Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
<s> If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
<s> ...get the hell outta here already...
<s> Hi, Mike?
<s> Are you on the other line?
<s> I can call back...
<s> Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
<s> ...the Michelin commercial...
<s> You don't call.
<s> Right.
<s> Right.
<s> Right... or more likely the opposite.
<s> Thanks. Thanks, man.
<s> What do you want? You're tall.
<s> Well, until now. Tend the pin.
<s> I do. Good for you, man.
<s> Ah, there's the rub...
<s> ..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
<s> It's unbelievable.
<s> I'll be your winger.
<s> Well, that's dumb.
<s> Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
<s> ...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
<s> Not well.
<s> I can't believe you.
<s> ...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
<s> Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
<s> Vegas!
<s> You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
<s> Did she, or did she not smile?
<s> We're gonna get laid, baby.
<s> What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
<s> Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
<s> Yea, how much?
<s> What an asshole.
<s> That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
<s> You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
<s> ...gotta...
<s> Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
<s> "Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
<s> What?
<s> You didn't have to get into it, baby.
<s> Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
<s> I didn't even like her, to be honest.
<s> She thought you were money.
<s> I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
<s> Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
<s> How?
<s> You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
<s> See? And what does this guy she's with do?
<s> Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
<s> Aww... He got away?
<s> ...through the kitchen...
<s> Minnie Pearl.
<s> She didn't notice.
<s> Oh. He's got it under control...
<s> No.
<s> You think?
<s> ...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
<s> ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
<s> Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
<s> ...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
<s> ...it's on.
<s> ...just be smart about it.
<s> Six.
<s> Yes. 
<s> I ask for Justice.
<s> You have to answer for Santino.
<s> OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
<s> How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
<s> No, just you and Paulie.
<s> We gotta move...
<s> Sure.
<s> Maybe, or you gotta know now.
<s> What percentages for my family?
<s> He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
<s> Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
<s> I'm going to finish school.
<s> I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
<s> How did you find out?
<s> The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
<s> Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
<s> How do you know I come from America?
<s> Shhhhh.
<s> This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
<s> That's for you to find out.
<s> The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
<s> No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
<s> Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
<s> We're all tired...
<s> No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
<s> No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
<s> You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
<s> I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
<s> An accident.  No one was hurt.
<s> Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
<s> My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
<s> As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
<s> How is your father?
<s> Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
<s> How's Mom?
<s> What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
<s> He talked to you?
<s> Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
<s> Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
<s> You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
<s> Sure. Any time.
<s> What? What's this?
<s> I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
<s> I love jazz.
<s> I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
<s> This is so good of you.
<s> Your parents met her.
<s> You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
<s> A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
<s> Relax.
<s> Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
<s> What club?
<s> I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
<s> I'm prepared to take the blame.
<s> I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
<s> What?
<s> So tell me.
<s> You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
<s> I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Dickie?
<s> Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
<s> He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
<s> Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
<s> We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
<s> Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
<s> Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
<s> I absolutely agree with Marge.
<s> Frances?
<s> Sure.
<s> Tom, you startled me! You're back.
<s> Ha. Did he say why?
<s> Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
<s> Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
<s> Dickie did it.
<s> Hello Marge!
<s> He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
<s> Why do you have Dickie's rings?
<s> I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
<s> You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
<s> Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
<s> Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
<s> My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
<s> Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
<s> You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
<s> Hello Meredith.
<s> Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
<s> You know what -- I am.
<s> He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
<s> Not at all. Morning Tom.
<s> Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
<s> I give up.
<s> All kinds of things. Making plans.
<s> I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
<s> The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
<s> Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
<s> Huh?
<s> Nah. I ain't interested.
<s> Who mam?
<s> Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
<s> Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
<s> I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
<s> If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
<s> No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
<s> Thank you, Travis.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
<s> More people watch it.
<s> I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
<s> You sure he's not Italian?
<s> With the other hand, right?
<s> I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
<s> Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
<s> Could you see anything?
<s> A real skunk.
<s> We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
<s> Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
<s> What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
<s> Stick up?
<s> You carry a piece? You need one?
<s> I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
<s> It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
<s> I musta been stoned.
<s> Oh, come off it, man.
<s> Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
<s> Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
<s> Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
<s> He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
<s> I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
<s> I... I don't get along with people like that.
<s> Besides, I've got to stay here.
<s> Do I look like a narc?
<s> Cops don't do nothin.
<s> You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
<s> I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
<s> Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
<s> The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
<s> Yes I am.
<s> Why, thank you Travis.
<s> I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
<s> I know. I tried that.
<s> You want to work uptown nights?
<s> How's your driving record?
<s> Physical? Criminal?
<s> Military record?
<s> You would, huh?
<s> I'm no cop.  I want some action.
<s> Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
<s> Slow.
<s> I know.
<s> Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
<s> Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
<s> That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
<s> MY girlfriend's pregnant.
<s> Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
<s> Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
<s> The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
<s> Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
<s> I am, too.
<s> Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
<s> Delly?  In here.
<s> Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
<s> I've seen you before.  Your picture...
<s> Well... where can we go?
<s> It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
<s> Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
<s> Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
<s> A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
<s> You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
<s> Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
<s> Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
<s> Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
<s> Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
<s> Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
<s> That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
<s> Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
<s> What's that?
<s> We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
<s> Nine and-a-half years...
<s> Mother.  She's beautiful.
<s> Oh.  What... what time is it?
<s> Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
<s> Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
<s> You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
<s> Yes?
<s> They're...
<s> You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
<s> Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
<s> Sandra Sinclair.
<s> I... no, I... I just can't...
<s> We live in a theater?
<s> Aren't you coming?
<s> Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
<s> I... I don't believe this.
<s> No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
<s> I was decorated.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Yeah, well, that's enough.
<s> Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
<s> So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
<s> No thanks.
<s> No, I...
<s> We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
<s> Oh...
<s> You bet, honey.
<s> What exactly did you hear?
<s> Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
<s> Yes?
<s> Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
<s> Yes.
<s> It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
<s> I think so.
<s> Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> When was this?
<s> I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
<s> No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
<s> I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
<s> That's up to you.
<s> If your father were here...
<s> They're birds!
<s> Oh, I suppose so.
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> It's Alice.
<s> Yes?
<s> Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
<s> Yep?
<s> That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
<s> It's nothing.
<s> I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
<s> The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
<s> Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
<s> What happened?
<s> Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
<s> For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
<s> I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
<s> I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
<s> I know exactly what I want, Mother.
<s> That's a chance we have to take.
<s> You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
<s> No, not exactly.
<s> Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
<s> Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
<s> He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
<s> Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
<s> Did you close the door?
<s> Not by the thousands.
<s> Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
<s> What are we going to do about it, Al?
<s> No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
<s> Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
<s> Lovebirds.
<s> Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
<s> I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
<s> Are they moulting now?
<s> We met in court.
<s> That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
<s> Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
<s> I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
<s> Criminal.
<s> I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
<s> Why would I want to see you, of all people?
<s> Look, Mr. Brenner...
<s> Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
<s> Seven o'clock then.
<s> How does Mother know what I like to do?
<s> Yes, but...
<s> I'm glad you do.
<s> Are you staying?
<s> Certainly, of birds.
<s> Well, they'll go along with anything.
<s> After the gulls attacked.
<s> It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
<s> Don't let's take any chances.
<s> Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
<s> Inland.
<s> Mitch...
<s> You said three o'clock.
<s> Yes.
<s> I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Do you have any lovebirds?
<s> That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
<s> Can we go on living here otherwise?
<s> Of course.
<s> Can't you please finish your drink?
<s> I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
<s> I want you to help my little girl.
<s> Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
<s> He's a great doctor -- a great man --
<s> You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
<s> But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
<s> No.
<s> I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
<s> They'll be thinking of that, too.
<s> No.
<s> It was a woman when we put her in.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Why, yes.
<s> Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
<s> It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
<s> No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
<s> I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
<s> We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
<s> Three years.
<s> But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
<s> Aye.
<s> I'm looking for my friends.
<s> Dream on.
<s> Keep that thing away from me.
<s> Good thing in a situation like this.
<s> The scar.
<s> You're the guy killed Dutton.
<s> Nobody.
<s> He didn't kill her.
<s> No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
<s> Yeah, we do.
<s> Could say that.
<s> What did I say?
<s> He said he'd prove it.
<s> Looks like you have them both on.
<s> No.
<s> Yes -- that is true.
<s> If you mean that you are afraid of us--
<s> We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
<s> That's what I came to see you about.
<s> I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes -- of course.
<s> That can easily be arranged.
<s> Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
<s> Professor Barnhardt.
<s> What do you mean, dear?
<s> Yes, I have!
<s> Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
<s> I shouldn't be at all surprised.
<s> I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
<s> It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
<s> Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
<s> All right.
<s> Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
<s> Sit down, Mr. Harley.
<s> About 250 million of your miles.
<s> From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
<s> I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
<s> We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
<s> Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
<s> What about him?
<s> All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
<s> Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
<s> Goodnight, my dear.
<s> May I see you for a minute?
<s> I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
<s> You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
<s> Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
<s> I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
<s> You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
<s> I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
<s> Would you like to sell it?
<s> I'd give you a very good price.
<s> That's right.
<s> It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
<s> No -- I'm afraid not.
<s> It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
<s> Can't stand light?
<s> We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
<s> Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
<s> <u>Four</u> to go.
<s> Honda 250, huh?
<s> Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
<s> If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> Who, Laddie?
<s> No.  Just you.
<s> I like Michael.
<s> Mom... please.
<s> Can't.  Got plans of my own.
<s> That's the boardwalk, Sam.
<s> I thought we were poor.
<s> Must be a circuit breaker.
<s> I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
<s> Do I look that needy?
<s> Hi, Thorn.
<s> Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
<s> Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
<s> I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
<s> Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
<s> Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
<s> If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
<s> I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
<s> Because I love you...
<s> Take laddie.
<s> Save Laddie first.
<s> Don't bother.
<s> Don't turn on the light.
<s> Nanook...
<s> I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
<s> Let's load 'em.
<s> It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
<s> Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<s> I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
<s> Maybe.
<s> So what's our problem?
<s> If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
<s> I don't know who to trust.
<s> No.  Just let him freeze out there.
<s> That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
<s> Was dark... find a light...
<s> I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
<s> Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
<s> Look, I'm just guessing...
<s> Damn you, MacReady!
<s> A couple of hours.
<s> Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
<s> After all this mess.
<s> That far?
<s> What's that?
<s> You reach anybody yet?
<s> No.
<s> Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
<s> Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
<s> Why?
<s> Forget about Childs.  He's over.
<s> You crazy?  He might be inside already?
<s> So what do you make of it?
<s> Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
<s> It's the generator I think!  No power.
<s> What?!
<s> Can't hear you.
<s> The journey is part of my work.
<s> And everyone looks like us?
<s> I'm so sorry, Kalen.
<s> What kind of stories?
<s> How did you know?!
<s> I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
<s> Morlocks --
<s> Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
<s> Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Yes.
<s> Kalen... hold on a minute.
<s> It frightens you.
<s> It was meant to.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, shut up.
<s> Yes.
<s> The air... the power.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> How do you control the Morlocks?
<s> Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
<s> Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
<s> No...
<s> I'm a foolish man.
<s> Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
<s> Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
<s> What's happening to the moon?!
<s> You know I can't.
<s> Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
<s> I mean... well... affection.
<s> And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
<s> Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
<s> I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
<s> Alex, it's just the zoo.
<s> It's only a machine.
<s> I have something for you...
<s> How romantic...
<s> It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
<s> I live with it every minute of every day.
<s> What is it?
<s> When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
<s> I'm glad.
<s> His home.
<s> Sir...?
<s> Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
<s> Your husband is dead?
<s> I will...
<s> You can see so many here.
<s> Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
<s> What's it all for?
<s> You liked it there.
<s> It must have been safe.
<s> Orion's belt...
<s> You lost someone.
<s> I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
<s> Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
<s> Do you have it?!
<s> No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
<s> What are your people called?
<s> New Yorkers.
<s> I took a different route.
<s> Why?
<s> I suppose so.
<s> Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
<s> They've gone to a better place.
<s> Kalen...
<s> And you've no idea where he went?
<s> I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> [Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
<s> Depends on what you're seeing.
<s> [Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
<s> That wasn't a fucking restraint.
<s> Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
<s> No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
<s> I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
<s> How?
<s> So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
<s> Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
<s> Mom, he just fixed our car.
<s> Why?
<s> Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
<s> [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
<s> [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
<s> Well, you belong in one.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
<s> You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
<s> It's Sunday.
<s> Good. How's your mom?
<s> I'm doing fine.
<s> He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
<s> I guess I'd ask you why.
<s> So it's helping?
<s> Come on. Tell me what you do know.
<s> How...how do you know?
<s> I did?
<s> Who told you this?
<s> I wasn't talking about anything.
<s> Why?
<s> No.
<s> Sure.
<s> [Beat] Thanks.
<s> You don't have anywhere to stay?
<s> You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
<s> The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
<s> Yes, baby?
<s> That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
<s> It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
<s> Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
<s> You want to come on in?
<s> Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
<s> Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
<s> Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
<s> It's him.
<s> My Lord.
<s> The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
<s> You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
<s> I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
<s> Well, you wanna use the shower?
<s> I'm a robber.
<s> God.  You're a real live outlaw!
<s> Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
<s> I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
<s> Peaches.
<s> Maybe.
<s> It's nothin' like that.
<s> Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
<s> What kind of stuff do I bring?
<s> Isn't this fun?
<s> Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
<s> Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
<s> Ready when you are.
<s> Get the car.
<s> West.  Left.
<s> Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
<s> No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
<s> I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
<s> Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
<s> I don't know.  I won't be.
<s> I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
<s> You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
<s> I won't wait up.
<s> I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
<s> You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
<s> Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
<s> Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
<s> Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
<s> They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
<s> Let's get it over with.
<s> I... I...
<s> Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
<s> Now what what?
<s> You mean now or before?
<s> We should have just ignored him.
<s> I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
<s> That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
<s> No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
<s> What?
<s> Yup.
<s> What?!
<s> Oh.
<s> Unbearable, I'd imagine.
<s> You, too, sweetie, the best.
<s> Hi there!  You alright?
<s> Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
<s> You sent that?
<s> That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
<s> He implied it.
<s> Yeah, but he was successful.
<s> Good-looking?
<s> Never?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
<s> He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
<s> What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
<s> Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
<s> Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
<s> Call you back.
<s> No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
<s> I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
<s> What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
<s> Healy, what I just tell you?
<s> You found my car?!
<s> Dumbshit.
<s> I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
<s> Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
<s> -- He's in a cage?!
<s> They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
<s> What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
<s> That...? Vestibule.
<s> Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
<s> Well, I'll see ya.
<s> Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
<s> She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
<s> No.
<s> You can't be serious.
<s> Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
<s> Oh my.
<s> It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
<s> Your turn?
<s> What?
<s> Did you study under Kim Greene?
<s> Kim and I are close friends!
<s> Bullshit!
<s> How'd you manage that one?
<s> Fucking sickening.
<s> You were following us?
<s> Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
<s> Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
<s> Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
<s> I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
<s> He's no Steve Young.
<s> Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
<s> Puffy, get over here.
<s> Where would I have seen your work?
<s> No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
<s> You mean he's not a criminal?
<s> Hi, Mary.
<s> Oh great, I ran out.
<s> Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
<s> I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
<s> Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
<s> Toy poodle!
<s> I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
<s> Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
<s> I think a little of both.
<s> How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I wasn't trying --
<s> No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
<s> Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
<s> Giddy-up.
<s> Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
<s> We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
<s> Yes.
<s> Tomorrow...
<s> We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
<s> He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
<s> -- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
<s> Smoke.
<s> I think it's a bad idea.
<s> -- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
<s> Says what, Kenny?
<s> And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
<s> Time is of the essence.
<s> We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
<s> The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
<s> Kids are supposed to get detention.
<s> I said his heart, not his attention.
<s> Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
<s> Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
<s> Dean Rusk!
<s> I, uh...
<s> Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
<s> You're scared to cancel on Daly.
<s> I don't know. I don't know.
<s> I know, I know...
<s> I'm gonna protect those pilots.
<s> Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
<s> And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
<s> I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
<s> Just a second, Mr. President.
<s> They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
<s> No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
<s> You crashed my file?
<s> Ray.
<s> Check him out, Ray.
<s> We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
<s> I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
<s> Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
<s> When did we get that?
<s> Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
<s> Why?
<s> -- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
<s> Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
<s> His spiritual mother...
<s> He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
<s> He said he doesn't know.
<s> Why should I tell you.
<s> And...
<s> He also said "listen to the water."
<s> I don't see the connection.
<s> What you call myths, we call our history.
<s> Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
<s> At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
<s> Well, it was just a dream, I --
<s> We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
<s> Yeah. Fitful dreams.
<s> What?
<s> Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
<s> You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
<s> NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
<s> No. No, no. Thank you.
<s> -- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
<s> At Sioux Falls Pen?
<s> What the fuck you talkin' about?
<s> How the hell do you know?
<s> I'm with someone.
<s> Yeow!
<s> I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
<s> It's classified.
<s> You let me make a fool of myself.
<s> Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
<s> You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
<s> What plane.
<s> Used to what?
<s> I'm starting to sense that now.
<s> Make what?
<s> You're an animal.
<s> I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
<s> Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
<s> Are you really that brave?
<s> I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
<s> Anything.
<s> Where'd you get it.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I was flying...my responsibility.
<s> Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
<s> I sit. I think. I play games.
<s> What truth?
<s> That's up to you.
<s> Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
<s> Well?
<s> Remember one thing.
<s> It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
<s> Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
<s> You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
<s> It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
<s> Not anymore.
<s> BREAKING LEFT!
<s> I GOT ONE COMING UP.
<s> Roger, I've got it.
<s> What are you talking about, we gotta go!
<s> You go. I'm staying with it.
<s> But I have to!
<s> You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
<s> Like what?
<s> Who's your pilot?
<s> No shit. The Iceman....
<s> Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
<s> Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
<s> He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
<s> Right.
<s> I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
<s> Come on, relax...
<s> Let's go. Eject.
<s> It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
<s> WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
<s> Figured out what?
<s> It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
<s> No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
<s> Then why are you here?
<s> Or....
<s> I never heard that.
<s> Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
<s> And you get a kickback.
<s> The Last Resort!  Quick!
<s> Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
<s> Definitely.
<s> Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
<s> So why am I still alive?
<s> That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Don't be an idiot.
<s> What is it?
<s> I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
<s> Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
<s> Eight years.
<s> Hetero.
<s> Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
<s> Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
<s> Swallow this.
<s> It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
<s> O.K., everybody pull out!
<s> Where's Kuato?
<s> Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
<s> Melina!
<s> "RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
<s> Well don't.
<s> Harry!
<s> Up to the right.
<s> Drive!  DRIVE!!
<s> Yeah, sweetheart?
<s> No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
<s> Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
<s> Doug...
<s> I'm not your wife.
<s> It was implanted by the Agency.
<s> Implanted.
<s> Beats me.  I just work here.
<s> I'm here at Rekall.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> Doug, don't!
<s> Come on, don't bullshit me.
<s> Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
<s> I love you.
<s> Not any more.
<s> I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
<s> Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
<s> I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
<s> It's just up ahead.
<s> Enough for everybody to breathe?
<s> Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
<s> One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
<s> My cannon.
<s> Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
<s> Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
<s> Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
<s> Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
<s> I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
<s> Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
<s> Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
<s> No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
<s> Nope, there!  That's one.
<s> Why?
<s> Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
<s> We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
<s> That's the plan.
<s> Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
<s> Adios, bridge!
<s> What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
<s> You're hung up again.
<s> Fifteen lousy bucks.
<s> Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
<s> Oh shit!
<s> Me, too.
<s> Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
<s> Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
<s> I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
<s> What?
<s> You are so full of shit...
<s> If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
<s> It's...gone...!
<s> Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
<s> Why do you all keep asking me?
<s> Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
<s> Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
<s> LET'S DO IT!
<s> And one good guy.
<s> True.
<s> I have to talk to your brother.
<s> Where's the nearest hospital?
<s> Sustained.
<s> Sustained.
<s> It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
<s> No further questions.
<s> So go take your job on Wall Street.
<s> "Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
<s> I didn't ask for a closing argument.
<s> Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
<s> Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
<s> That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
<s> What's Art Esparza?
<s> Christ... Shu is innocent.
<s> Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
<s> ...For ten years, now.
<s> Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
<s> I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
<s> But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
<s> Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
<s> Right.
<s> How can I tell you what I don't know!
<s> "No," what?
<s> It's okay, Eddie.
<s> I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
<s> Shu Kai Kim.
<s> This and that.
<s> Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
<s> That's big of you, Bob.
<s> I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
<s> Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
<s> The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
<s> I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
<s> I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
<s> That's right.
<s> I would tend to plead the Fifth.
<s> Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
<s> That's right.
<s> Soldado.
<s> Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
<s> I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
<s> Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
<s> Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
<s> I am going over here.
<s> Oh.
<s> Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
<s> Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
<s> NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
<s> YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
<s> Anything else?
<s> Stanley, I heard all about it.
<s> Someone else has it now.
<s> The later events have never been kept a secret.
<s> Where's Hap?
<s> Did she ever mention any friends?
<s> What happened to her?
<s> Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
<s> Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
<s> We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
<s> In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
<s> She must have known someone.
<s> When?
<s> I don't know what to do.
<s> You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
<s> I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
<s> Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
<s> Okay, I suppose I should go home.
<s> If I can smoke it.
<s> No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
<s> Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
<s> Not you, Donna, not you.
<s> I did? I didn't see anything.
<s> But Bob isn't real.
<s> No... No...
<s> I am The Muffin.
<s> Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
<s> Gobble, gobble, gobble.
<s> You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
<s> Everything, but everything.
<s> What?
<s> What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
<s> Boating?
<s> Trees?
<s> Fish eyes?
<s> Sure honey, what's the hurry?
<s> What were you doing in my room?
<s> I'm sorry, Mom.
<s> No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
<s> You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
<s> NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
<s> Oh, Leland.
<s> She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
<s> The man's an ambulance chaser...
<s> You thought it was just.
<s> That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
<s> It looks that way.
<s> Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
<s> What does it mean?
<s> Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I...
<s> After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
<s> I'm just an M.D.
<s> 'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
<s> ...I was one of a group of...
<s> Yes.
<s> Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
<s> Tell me one?
<s> She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
<s> ...We did everything we could...
<s> I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
<s> It was good of you to meet...
<s> From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
<s> ...I made a reservation at...
<s> In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
<s> No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
<s> Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
<s> Why is that?
<s> ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
<s> Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
<s> I. Yes. It is.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
<s> Why?
<s> Yes...
<s> Yes.
<s> She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
<s> Yes.
<s> ...things change.
<s> I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
<s> I changed my room at the Hotel.
<s> The TV didn't work.
<s> And what are you? A cop?
<s> My ex-husband was a lawyer.
<s> Laura.
<s> What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
<s> And are they going to get it?
<s> Maybe what?
<s> Do you want me to go...?
<s> Isn't there something you...
<s> I...
<s> You, you don't under...
<s> What is that to you...?
<s> No... no...
<s> I don't have a goddamned idea.
<s> Let me talk to Mickey.
<s> It's locked.
<s> A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
<s> I'm going to see you get that chance.
<s> We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
<s> One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
<s> I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
<s> Admittance form is wrong.
<s> So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
<s> Oh shit, what's today?
<s> D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> You use their witness.
<s> She did?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, the roving nurse...
<s> As I've said we had some more...
<s> We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
<s> That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
<s> We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
<s> We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
<s> There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
<s> Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
<s> Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
<s> I didn't know how to stop you...!
<s> Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
<s> I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
<s> But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
<s> I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
<s> I liked him.
<s> It was...  ...one of them!
<s> It might give us something.
<s> I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
<s> There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
<s> D.O. to number three..come in.
<s> I don't follow.
<s> You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
<s> Chase. Hi...
<s> Chase, it's Dylan!
<s> Heather, has there been another call?
<s> Oh my God...
<s> Everything is not fine!
<s> Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
<s> What?
<s> Finish, please!
<s> Don't let the bedbugs bite.
<s> I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
<s> Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
<s> Here.
<s> Read me some?
<s> I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
<s> When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
<s> That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
<s> Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
<s> John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
<s> Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
<s> Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
<s> Yes?
<s> Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
<s> It can be captured, sometimes.
<s> Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Yep.
<s> Your father?
<s> Guilty.
<s> I haven't forgotten.
<s> He has a lot of hurt inside him.
<s> Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
<s> Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
<s> My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
<s> My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
<s> To take a piss.
<s> If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
<s> Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
<s> Believe what?
<s> Yeah.  How'd you do.
<s> What was that?
<s> You don't give him enough credit Chas.
<s> Like this!
<s> I guess.
<s> I gotta go.
<s> I know enough.
<s> That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
<s> Come on man, what'd they look like?
<s> How do you know?  They might.
<s> Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
<s> Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
<s> You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
<s> Of what?
<s> Your cannons made a compelling argument.
<s> Twice.
<s> This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
<s> Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
<s> Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> You're officer of the watch, George.
<s> Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
<s> Why'd you jump?
<s> Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
<s> It seems we're short on singers.
<s> About anything.
<s> You've gotta be kidding?
<s> Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
<s> Sir.
<s> The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
<s> I'm not staying out here.
<s> I'm sorry...
<s> Aaauuuhhh!!!
<s> I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
<s> Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
<s> I understand.
<s> ... Absolutely not.
<s> Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
<s> I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
<s> How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
<s> Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
<s> Why? He's right in the groove.
<s> We don't have no paper bags.
<s> How old are you?
<s> No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
<s> Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
<s> That'd be fine, Bobby.
<s> No, haven't heard of it.
<s> Sorry to hear it.
<s> What's that?
<s> Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
<s> Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
<s> She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
<s> Set one up.
<s> Sounds right... I'll check it out.
<s> Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
<s> Whattaya do there?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
<s> Hasta siempre.
<s> I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
<s> Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
<s> That bastard Pucinski...
<s> And?
<s> Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
<s> Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
<s> It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
<s> Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
<s> How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
<s> I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
<s> Didn't he say somethin'?
<s> I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
<s> You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
<s> It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
<s> What's that?
<s> Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
<s> Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
<s> You mean like pedal pushers?
<s> You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
<s> Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
<s> One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
<s> Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
<s> You certain?
<s> Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
<s> Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
<s> Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
<s> Gotta hex from a voodoo?
<s> Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
<s> Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
<s> Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
<s> I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
<s> I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
<s> No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
<s> My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
<s> I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
<s> I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
<s> And Bobby too, I hear...
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
<s> What could I be up to, Lula?
<s> That was in Vietnam.
<s> What?
<s> Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
<s> Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
<s> He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
<s> What makes sense, is all.
<s> SAILOR!!!!
<s> Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
<s> No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
<s> Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
<s> You ain't takin' Pace, though.
<s> What time's Sailor's train get in?
<s> Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
<s> I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
<s> Santos... It isn't.
<s> I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's your business... I don't care how.
<s> Santos...
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> See! I knew you had it all under control.
<s> Santos... No... Please, Santos...
<s> Santos... I can't...
<s> You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
<s> You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
<s> You heard right.
<s> I didn't see nothin'...
<s> Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
<s> Well?...
<s> That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
<s> Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
<s> Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
<s> We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> She left me. Crabs.
<s> I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
<s> What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
<s> Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
<s> Competence.
<s> So sensitive.
<s> It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
<s> Call it a hunch.
<s> In a sense.
<s> That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
<s> How long have you been smoking marijuana?
<s> That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
<s> I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
<s> No sweat. Only do me a favor?
<s> No. Sara, you don't understand...
<s> She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
<s> I had to. Didn't I?
<s> Who?
<s> Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
<s> Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
<s> Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
<s> I guess there's probably a story behind that.
<s> So where have you been staying?
<s> But James. I mean... How long?
<s> Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
<s> Hm.
<s> Yeah, well, actually...
<s> Glaucoma?
<s> Where's that?
<s> Kinship.
<s> I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
<s> I didn't mean it that way.
<s> In a minute. Get us a table.
<s> Okay.
<s> James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
<s> I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
<s> I thank you.
<s> I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
<s> Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
<s> The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
<s> He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
<s> Who does?
<s> I told you, Sewickly Heights.
<s> Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
<s> Simple.
<s> I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
<s> No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
<s> It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
<s> Really? That was fast.
<s> I know that. I know what's at stake here...
<s> Grady.
<s> Oh?
<s> I... I...
<s> I'm in love with your wife.
<s> Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
<s> Her husband.
<s> Hey, Professor Tripp.
<s> As a heart attack.
<s> Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
<s> Why did you come here, Grady?
<s> A jockey? You mean, like --
<s> I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
<s> No, I'm going ho --
<s> Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
<s> I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
<s> Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
<s> No shit.
<s> I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
<s> No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
<s> You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
<s> When can I see her?
<s> Is it because of Anna?
<s> How old is Anna?
<s> Huh?
<s> Yeah. It's really nice.
<s> It was a beautiful present.
<s> She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
<s> Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
<s> Isn't it?
<s> Ask me. Ask me anything.
<s> The mother sure has her hands full.
<s> You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
<s> It's my bird book.
<s> I'm not pretty.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who said I wanted to buy it?
<s> You can't talk to me like --
<s> Yes.
<s> Know what?
<s> I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
<s> It's a free country, isn't it?
<s> Apartment's okay.
<s> What?
<s> Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
<s> If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
<s> It sounds like you were banished.
<s> That's okay... doesn't matter.
<s> I can't.
<s> Your daddy will always love you.
<s> I know because... it's just something I know.
<s> I don't mind.
<s> I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
<s> What?
<s> Reflect.
<s> No fucking way.
<s> Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
<s> I don't feel anything.
<s> Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
<s> I couldn't say.
<s> They usually tell me.
<s> I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
<s> Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> Why?
<s> In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
<s> This is garbage!
<s> That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
<s> I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
<s> I thought you were a dyke.
<s> K through sixth.
<s> Yeah, they could.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> You're still here.
<s> Maybe later.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Twelve years in prison is no joke.
<s> How many girls did you molest?
<s> What?
<s> Hey, I'm not --
<s> You don't really --
<s> Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
<s> No. That's what I used to tell myself.
<s> Which brother did this?
<s> What?
<s> Just think about it.
<s> Do what?
<s> Yeah.
<s> We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
<s> Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
<s> No way that could just be seawater.
<s> What is that?  You drop your dive light?
<s> Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
<s> What do you think he saw?
<s> I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
<s> Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
<s> Lindsey!  Wait a second--
<s> Chill out, Lindsey!!
<s> It's trying to communicate.
<s> Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
<s> Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
<s> Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
<s> What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
<s> No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
<s> Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
<s> I can't afford slack, Brigman.
<s> Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
<s> Yuh?
<s> Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
<s> Give me that!!
<s> Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
<s> Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
<s> Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
<s> It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
<s> It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
<s> And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
<s> But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
<s> Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
<s> No.
<s> Occasionally, but always with affection.
<s> But then when will we see each other?
<s> I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
<s> But why, Claudia?... Why?
<s> Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
<s> I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
<s> I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
<s> Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
<s> It was futile. We went all over.
<s> But then why did you bother changing?
<s> Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
<s> Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
<s> Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
<s> But why?... What if it starts to rain?
<s> There too...
<s> I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
<s> And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
<s> I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
<s> I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
<s> Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
<s> Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
<s> Yes, she takes care of the garden.
<s> So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
<s> Unfortunately, no.
<s> Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
<s> What boat?
<s> Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
<s> Yes. Until proven otherwise.
<s> You're kidding!
<s> Is that possible?
<s> Through someone else?
<s> That's not what he meant.
<s> Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
<s> I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
<s> No I don't.
<s> God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
<s> I love you.
<s> At least once a week.
<s> How were you sick?
<s> Where did the baby come from?
<s> Then let's talk about something else...
<s> Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
<s> No... do you?
<s> Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
<s> An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
<s> No, but I can never tell her that.
<s> Not my fault.
<s> I'm always bad.
<s> No...
<s> I can't.
<s> She says my whole body's a mistake.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
<s> Yes.
<s> Because I wasn't worthy.
<s> Yes.
<s> She made me promise not to.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> We went to chapel for vespers.
<s> I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
<s> What do you feel?
<s> Yes.
<s> And the passage to the barn?
<s> Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
<s> Who?
<s> Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
<s> Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
<s> Who are you?
<s> How do you survive?
<s> ... Thank you.
<s> Unfiltered.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why do you think that?
<s> What's your opinion?
<s> From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
<s> How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
<s> So, someone else could have done it.
<s> One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
<s> And what happened?
<s> What?
<s> How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
<s> Aquittal.
<s> Answers.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yes.
<s> What sheets?
<s> Nothing...
<s> And what has that to do with it?
<s> Long, thin and filtered.
<s> There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
<s> Would it stop you if I did?
<s> You think she's a saint?
<s> Well give me a reasonable explanation
<s> This is insane.
<s> But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
<s> That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
<s> I'm concerned about her health.
<s> Where is she?
<s> I have a few more questions to ask her.
<s> The scandal...
<s> She didn't want any help.
<s> I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
<s> No!
<s> I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
<s> Agnes, what happened to the baby?
<s> Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
<s> Bet you're only eight and a half.
<s> Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
<s> Not much cop without 'em, is it?
<s> Yeah?
<s> How about Ding Dong?
<s> Yeah.
<s> The police station.
<s> And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
<s> I've made the scene.
<s> You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
<s> Bag-snatcher.
<s> Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
<s> Oh, my God, he's a natural.
<s> I'll have a bash.
<s> I don't care.
<s> A butcher?
<s> Ah well. Eh, look!
<s> He's sulking again.
<s> The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
<s> Come here.
<s> It's Paul's grandfather.
<s> Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
<s> I've got you worried, haven't I?
<s> How'd you guess?
<s> Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
<s> What's that mean?
<s> Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
<s> Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
<s> Is she?
<s> Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
<s> Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
<s> Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
<s> What's that mean?
<s> Oh ... I dunno.
<s> What?
<s> Lip reading.
<s> Is there a fire, then?
<s> What's he on about?
<s> You see, sly villains.
<s> Every morning.
<s> It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
<s> You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
<s> We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
<s> Hiding.
<s> Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
<s> That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
<s> Ah, go on, you swine.
<s> Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
<s> We were going to do it.
<s> Hi, our lot!
<s> What?
<s> What have you heard?
<s> Aah, shurrup, misery!
<s> Oh, leave off!!!
<s> Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
<s> Y'what?
<s> Don't start. Look.
<s> Sorry.
<s> But...
<s> Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
<s> I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
<s> Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
<s> And they want me?
<s> Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
<s> You were twanging too loud.
<s> Oh, anything you say, Paul.
<s> Cattle ranch!
<s> Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
<s> ... I don't know...
<s> No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
<s> Where the hell are we?
<s> That's what I'm going to do.
<s> Yeah.  Two hours.
<s> Receiving.
<s> What is it, I can't --
<s> God I'm hungry.
<s> I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
<s> <u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
<s> I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
<s> Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
<s> It grows on you.
<s> Shit...
<s> Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
<s> Dead.
<s> We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
<s> Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
<s> Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
<s> We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
<s> Ask him.
<s> Don't be an idiot.
<s> I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
<s> The flamethrower needs more fuel.
<s> What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
<s> Let me go first; you stay behind me.
<s> We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
<s> How many?
<s> Hey!  what about the film?
<s> And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
<s> I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
<s> Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
<s> How far?
<s> I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
<s> Sun will be down in a minute.
<s> We're going into the freezers now.
<s> The commander normally has first publication rights.
<s> We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
<s> What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
<s> Sandy, contact traffic control.
<s> Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
<s> Turn on navigation lights.
<s> Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
<s> Any microorganisms?
<s> Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
<s> I don't even know what I'm looking for.
<s> Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
<s> We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
<s> It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
<s> Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
<s> Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
<s> If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
<s> Quit complaining; we're in space.
<s> We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
<s> Even simple.
<s> We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
<s> By eating our food supplies.
<s> So the next step should be --
<s> Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
<s> At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
<s> But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
<s> Do you wanna head back and call it in?
<s> Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
<s> Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What's happening?
<s> Too many.
<s> Shit.  When?
<s> We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
<s> Match it!
<s> Has anybody talked to them?
<s> About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
<s> One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
<s> That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
<s> Where does that lead to?
<s> Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
<s> Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
<s> How many... how many people are missing?
<s> Looks like it.
<s> Well... try the headset.
<s> Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
<s> Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
<s> Not too much of the socializing type, then?
<s> And before that?
<s> Only six?
<s> Hold on...
<s> Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
<s> I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
<s> Please do.
<s> Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
<s> And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
<s> You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
<s> Lloyd and I.
<s> She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
<s> Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
<s> Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
<s> A dull cliche.
<s> You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
<s> Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
<s> And too many of them are produced.
<s> Hear, hear...
<s> Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
<s> It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
<s> Amen.
<s> Being violently ill to her tummy.
<s> Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
<s> I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
<s> I take it she read well.
<s> How nice.
<s> The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
<s> Huh?
<s> Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
<s> Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
<s> All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
<s> As of this moment you're six years old...
<s> When - when are you coming back?
<s> A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
<s> Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
<s> And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
<s> I get a party, don't I?
<s> It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
<s> It won't play.
<s> I thought you were going to be late-
<s> I had no idea you were even here.
<s> I don't think that's funny!
<s> Twenty minutes!
<s> You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
<s> Who?
<s> A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
<s> Why you have to go out there.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
<s> They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
<s> Oh, brother.
<s> Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
<s> Something maybe grew a size bigger.
<s> Do you want an argument or an answer?
<s> My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
<s> How did you get in here?
<s> You were just looking around...
<s> I've heard of them.
<s> With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
<s> You rest. I'll get it...
<s> Why should you think I wouldn't be?
<s> Oh, no. I see the play.
<s> Oh, no...
<s> No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
<s> It couldn't possibly interest you.
<s> The show must go on.
<s> If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
<s> Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
<s> - and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
<s> I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
<s> Well - if I'm not in the way...
<s> They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
<s> Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
<s> Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
<s> Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
<s> I had no idea you knew each other.
<s> Why not?
<s> None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
<s> It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
<s> We've all seemed a little tense lately...
<s> More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
<s> Well...
<s> The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
<s> In a minute...
<s> That was a pity...
<s> I'm trying hard to follow you.
<s> Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
<s> Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
<s> With gestures, of course.
<s> Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
<s> Such as?
<s> Nothing much. She apologized.
<s> Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
<s> ... Among so many quiet qualities.
<s> Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
<s> The play? All right, I guess...
<s> You'd have been proud of her.
<s> That's beside the point.
<s> Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
<s> I just played it.
<s> But what could she do?
<s> I promise.
<s> Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
<s> --it was bullshit the way it was--
<s> Yeah?
<s> What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
<s> --Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
<s> --a spy, you mean?
<s> We need a sympathetic face.
<s> The fucking New York Times.
<s> --fifteen phone calls--
<s> Why didn't we get that?
<s> Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
<s> It's safe, try it, you'll see.
<s> --we will--
<s> You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
<s> --shit--
<s> How high up, which Republicans?
<s> --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
<s> --and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
<s> So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
<s> Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
<s> Night.
<s> Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
<s> The telephone calls... we know about that.
<s> --yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
<s> --Teddy Kennedy?
<s> I told you, he had to go out on a case.
<s> He is not in the car.  Sorry.
<s> You can't.
<s> It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
<s> And?--
<s> --goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
<s> --Deep Throat?--
<s> --what?--
<s> --there's nothing new in it--
<s> Give me your checkbook then.
<s> Which people?
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
<s> And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
<s> To cover up?
<s> --you double-checked both sources?--
<s> You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
<s> How senior?
<s> Electronic surveillance.
<s> So?
<s> I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
<s> That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
<s> John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
<s> This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
<s> The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
<s> --don't you miss the grand scheme too.
<s> Government. Recently retired.
<s> It may never come out.
<s> Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
<s> --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
<s> You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
<s> That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
<s> The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
<s> I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
<s> --go over your sources again--
<s> Absolutely.
<s> --can we use their names?--
<s> Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
<s> I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
<s> --well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
<s> My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
<s> You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
<s> No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
<s> Haldeman.  Right?
<s> The what to what?
<s> I'm not Miss Abbott.
<s> Sorry.
<s> -- Thanks, coach --
<s> I'm not good in math.
<s> Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
<s> When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
<s> Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
<s> You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
<s> Seduce her.
<s> First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
<s> You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
<s> Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
<s> Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
<s> Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
<s> Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
<s> Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
<s> No.  I'm missing the game for you.
<s> You called me Oz.
<s> Yeah right.
<s> What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
<s> Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
<s> You mean...and orgasm?
<s> Then what the hell are you talking about?
<s> I don't get it, that really works?
<s> Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
<s> I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
<s> Finch, you got the Latin homework?
<s> You can crash at Stifler's?
<s> But --
<s> No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
<s> Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
<s> No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
<s> Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
<s> My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
<s> Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
<s> I told you.
<s> Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
<s> "Fun loving" -- insane.
<s> Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
<s> Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
<s> Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
<s> Me?
<s> Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
<s> Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
<s> I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
<s> Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
<s> Okay, don't stop.
<s> No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
<s> Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
<s> Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
<s> Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
<s> Yeah, are you?
<s> Yeah, right here.
<s> I don't know.  How do you?
<s> Ready for what?
<s> Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
<s> Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
<s> Qualify for what?
<s> Once, in church, dude.
<s> How the hell do you know all these random songs?
<s> I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
<s> I don't care.
<s> Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
<s> Come on, you know the words, sing along.
<s> No shit.
<s> Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
<s> Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
<s> Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
<s> Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
<s> No it isn't! You're dead!
<s> What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
<s> Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
<s> Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
<s> Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
<s> Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
<s> I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
<s> Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
<s> Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
<s> So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
<s> Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
<s> I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
<s> Fuck me...
<s> That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
<s> What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
<s> What...?
<s> "Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
<s> You too.
<s> Andy...
<s> You on drugs? Huh?
<s> Shit!
<s> Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
<s> My uncle's in a coma you moron!
<s> If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
<s> What about me?
<s> Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
<s> You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
<s> Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
<s> Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
<s> Sort of...
<s> AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
<s> Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
<s> How well did, er, do you know him?
<s> Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
<s> Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
<s> I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
<s> Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
<s> Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
<s> But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
<s> Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
<s> Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
<s> Allo?
<s> But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Okay. So maybe you were right.
<s> Merde.
<s> You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
<s> What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
<s> How to read.
<s> I know, but I had to because . . .
<s> It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
<s> I'm not sure but look. . .
<s> I shant!
<s> Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
<s> Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
<s> I was all out of dynamite!
<s> I'm glad you	did too.
<s> I'll never let go!
<s> I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
<s> Yes, you do. You do.
<s> Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
<s> She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
<s> Shut up!
<s> That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
<s> Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
<s> Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
<s> Ah! Let us begin!
<s> If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
<s> Remove him at once.
<s> Young	man, I...
<s> Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
<s> Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
<s> You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
<s> This guy's on television.
<s> You don't want my autograph.
<s> I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
<s> Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
<s> Why not?
<s> It's okay.
<s> Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
<s> Alvy.
<s> If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
<s> L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
<s> You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
<s> I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
<s> You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
<s> M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
<s> It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
<s> All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
<s> Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
<s> Hey, that was last year.
<s> You-you play... very well.
<s> Oh, no, I have a car.
<s> No, Chippewa Falls.
<s> Wisconsin.
<s> Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
<s> I'll getcha a piece.
<s> Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
<s> You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Well...
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Neat, yeah.
<s> Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
<s> Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
<s> Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
<s> you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
<s> No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
<s> What?
<s> Oh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> U-huh.
<s> Oh! Italian, right?
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Of course.
<s> You don't want me to live with you?
<s> Mine.
<s> 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
<s> Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
<s> No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
<s> U-huh.
<s> Are yuh?
<s> No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
<s> M'm.
<s> I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
<s> Whatta you mean? Me?
<s> There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
<s> I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
<s> Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
<s> snow shovel or anything or something.
<s> Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
<s> Holy cow!
<s> Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
<s> Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
<s> Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
<s> Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
<s> No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
<s> Nothing at all?
<s> Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
<s> Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
<s> Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
<s> You should be ashamed of yourself.
<s> No jokes-these are friends, okay?
<s> Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
<s> The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
<s> I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
<s> I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
<s> It's a narrow view.
<s> ...as opposed to a print...
<s> Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
<s> This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
<s> Trigger.
<s> Yeah, I love it there.
<s> Whatta you mean?
<s> You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
<s> Ah, Max, you, uh...
<s> Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
<s> Max, I've got a hit series.
<s> I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
<s> Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
<s> Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
<s> And... uh-
<s> Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
<s> Yeah. Right.
<s> Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
<s> She was stealing.
<s> I look pretty.
<s> Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
<s> No.
<s> You think so? Do you really?
<s> Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
<s> Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
<s> ...of possibly working together.
<s> No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
<s> Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
<s> Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I was a great beauty.
<s> You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
<s> And you've only just met.
<s> The camera loves her.  A great actress.
<s> Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
<s> Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
<s> It's alright, isn't it?
<s> To dander.  Otis.
<s> Borrow whatever you like.
<s> I love her too, Joe.
<s> When does he graduate high school?
<s> Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
<s> I love you, Joe Therrian.
<s> Let's go upstairs, okay?
<s> She left a note.
<s> You have to sign your taxes anyway.
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
<s> Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
<s> Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
<s> Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
<s> I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
<s> Did you invite them?
<s> That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
<s> Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
<s> Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
<s> Happy anniversary.
<s> Hardly...
<s> I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
<s> Through the sweats or not?
<s> For good.
<s> They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
<s> You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
<s> I'm going to throw up.
<s> You can never be too early or too thin.
<s> Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
<s> Panes is not on your team anymore.
<s> You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
<s> It's ecstasy, Sal.
<s> Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
<s> Or shitty!!  Otis!!
<s> Otis!!!!
<s> Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
<s> Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
<s> It's a novel.
<s> Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
<s> This is insanity.  Sally...
<s> It's a Calder.
<s> Ah...
<s> Will you make love with me?
<s> Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
<s> Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
<s> Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
<s> Ah there's our snookums now.
<s> In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
<s> Elitism?
<s> Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
<s> Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
<s> That's a lot of those.
<s> A lot of cakes.
<s> This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
<s> I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
<s> Sally?
<s> Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
<s> There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Oh?
<s> I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
<s> Are you asking me to marry you?
<s> Very.
<s> Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
<s> "How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Why don't you go fuck yourself?
<s> Yes.  Fine.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
<s> I hope they're watercolors!
<s> Yes.
<s> Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
<s> He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
<s> No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
<s> Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
<s> That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
<s> Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
<s> It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
<s> No...as a matter of fact...
<s> Well I guess that makes us even.
<s> Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
<s> Well...no, but --
<s> Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
<s> Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
<s> Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
<s> It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
<s> Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
<s> Barbatus?
<s> I wonder...what...was it all...for...
<s> Duty calls!
<s> I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
<s> Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
<s> Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
<s> Oh, no, sir!
<s> I...I have no idea, sir.
<s> Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
<s> Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
<s> I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
<s> I'll be back.
<s> Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
<s> Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
<s> What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
<s> Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
<s> Well, I have some paper towels --
<s> Shall we say -- a dollar?
<s> It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
<s> That's me. 
<s> I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
<s> I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
<s> Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
<s> Eight-thirty!
<s> Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
<s> I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
<s> Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
<s> How many of those drinks did you have?
<s> Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
<s> I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
<s> You don't want me here --
<s> No -- I don't want anything.
<s> I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
<s> They had to pump it out.
<s> He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
<s> Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
<s> A bad insurance risk?
<s> Was he really upset when you told him?
<s> Can I have that pad and the pencil?
<s> I guess so.
<s> A what?
<s> I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Where?
<s> That's terrible.
<s> Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
<s> You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
<s> Might as well go all the way.
<s> You usually eat alone?
<s> What?
<s> Good night, Miss Kubelik.
<s> I'm fine all over.
<s> Shut up and deal!
<s> What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
<s> Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> Mr. Dobisch said that?
<s> Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Are you going to deny it?
<s> Relax, Baxter.
<s> You too, sir.
<s> Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
<s> I know how it is.
<s> Roger. And I'll get that other key.
<s> I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
<s> That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
<s> Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
<s> You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
<s> Now I'll have to borrow your key.
<s> I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
<s> You?
<s> Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
<s> Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
<s> Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
<s> No!
<s> Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
<s> You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
<s> Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
<s> Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
<s> Me?
<s> Let me get my bag.
<s> Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
<s> Sure.
<s> Kubelik -- with two k's.
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
<s> But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
<s> Sure, Doc.
<s> Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
<s> I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
<s> Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
<s> Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
<s> Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
<s> My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
<s> I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
<s> No.
<s> Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
<s> I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
<s> So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
<s> Let me take that.
<s> Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
<s> I wasn't trying.
<s> Okay. I'm sorry.
<s> Sssssh.
<s> I told you -- with my mother.
<s> Go where?
<s> I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
<s> You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
<s> Yeah --
<s> What's it matter? Get to the point.
<s> Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
<s> We need all our fuel.
<s> One for all -- all for one --
<s> I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
<s> Sure, thanks.
<s> Let's talk about you.
<s> Who are you ?
<s> Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
<s> He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
<s> What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
<s> I don't know.
<s> That we're dumber than we look.
<s> Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
<s> Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
<s> Shot himself. What for ?
<s> Where ?
<s> When'd you do it?
<s> Looks pretty shallow.
<s> Too far inland.
<s> Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
<s> Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
<s> They must have seen the fire.
<s> Okay, Willard, sit down.
<s> But why ?
<s> Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
<s> Your daughter.
<s> What, sir?
<s> Sure -- fine --
<s> What?
<s> Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
<s> Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
<s> Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
<s> No. Walked.
<s> I met him.
<s> Hairy ?
<s> So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
<s> Who?
<s> Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
<s> No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
<s> You can't have water after morphine.
<s> How's the pain?
<s> Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
<s> His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
<s> He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
<s> Nah.
<s> Which one's the Colonel's?
<s> No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
<s> When?
<s> I wasn't looking.. I was running.
<s> Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
<s> That's me.
<s> What is this bridge?
<s> Why didn't he shoot you?
<s> No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
<s> No. Not really.
<s> Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
<s> I do.
<s> Anyone got a card?
<s> 139  CONTINUED:
<s> It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
<s> There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
<s> I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
<s> 168  CONTINUED:
<s> Your infrared camera?
<s> 26   CONTINUED:  
<s> Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
<s> Somewhere along the pipeline.
<s> Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
<s> You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
<s> That's my line.
<s> -- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
<s> It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
<s> I'm here to do my job.
<s> You don't get it, do you?
<s> If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
<s> You don't feel cold?
<s> Where's my ELT?
<s> I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
<s> Don't bet on it.
<s> I'm living proof of that sad fact.
<s> You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
<s> I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
<s> -- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
<s> -- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
<s> You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
<s> Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
<s> -- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
<s> Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
<s> I'm right fuckin' here with you.
<s> Ease off.  We do this my way.
<s> We were just talking about him.
<s> Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
<s> Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yes.
<s> Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
<s> Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
<s> You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
<s> No.
<s> His name?
<s> It's okay -- I'll sit here.
<s> How old are you?
<s> If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
<s> Otherwise, you're not ugly.
<s> Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
<s> How do you know about my mother?
<s> How ya doing?
<s> Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
<s> Hey, what I did for you is working out?
<s> Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
<s> I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
<s> Thank you.
<s> I want you to go on this trip.
<s> I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
<s> You take off when you have to.
<s> Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
<s> Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
<s> Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
<s> Never.
<s> Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
<s> This one has a special meaning.
<s> I can trust my brain.
<s> See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
<s> Were you asleep?
<s> I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
<s> Good night.
<s> Stop staring. Do a vase.
<s> You think you're kidding.
<s> No. No. Get Carol.
<s> Two years ago...
<s> What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
<s> Sure -- take him to the vet.
<s> Do it.
<s> About a dog.
<s> If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
<s> Hi. You have hard shells, right?
<s> I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
<s> You little stinker. He's given you everything.
<s> No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
<s> Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
<s> You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
<s> Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
<s> No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
<s> But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
<s> Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
<s> I'm going back with you.
<s> I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
<s> Another place where?
<s> How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
<s> Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
<s> Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
<s> I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
<s> What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
<s> It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
<s> After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
<s> There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
<s> I ain't scared of you.
<s> If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
<s> What?
<s> Why don't you tell me.
<s> Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
<s> I'm worried about you, Robert.
<s> The contract was stolen.
<s> A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
<s> Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
<s> Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
<s> He stole another contract.
<s> Robert?  Robert?
<s> Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
<s> If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
<s> He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
<s> Yes.
<s> We don't have a choice.
<s> It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
<s> As in daughter of Agamemnon?
<s> Where you wanted to be?
<s> The C.I.A.?
<s> Why did you leave the Agency?
<s> Yes.
<s> Because I want to know.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
<s> Fine.
<s> Check.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
<s> Yes.  Here I am again.
<s> Did he explain how this happened?
<s> It can be.
<s> Yes.
<s> After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
<s> No.
<s> Honestly?
<s> Why?
<s> Right.
<s> Okay.
<s> I think you're supposed to answer that question.
<s> I called because I just want... I need to talk.
<s> All the time.
<s> Anytime.
<s> Why not?
<s> When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
<s> American currency.
<s> Thank you.
<s> And pay for their drinks occasionally.
<s> I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
<s> Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
<s> An alternative literary venue!
<s> We could make a run for it?
<s> That makes you an expert I guess.
<s> A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
<s> I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
<s> I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
<s> No....The Asylum!
<s> Can you do the lock on it?
<s> But how did the wall get here?
<s> Don't we have enough already?
<s> Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
<s> We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
<s> Have you ever stolen anything?
<s> Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
<s> Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
<s> Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
<s> Why don't we go together?
<s> I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
<s> What are you on about?
<s> No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
<s> What?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Yes.
<s> That's my mum's.
<s> I'll take a rain-check for now.
<s> Don't worry it's okay!
<s> I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
<s> Everybody is at home, it's no good.
<s> I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
<s> No, it's not true, you're lying.
<s> So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
<s> Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
<s> Great. And your all set for the performance?
<s> Great....How long will it go for?
<s> It's perfect, you've done a great job.
<s> I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
<s> What for?
<s> I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
<s> No, it should be over soon.
<s> Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
<s> I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
<s> Well she sure isn't normal.
<s> It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
<s> Yeah seems okay.
<s> Sure!
<s> Hmm, I still owe him.
<s> Alright!
<s> Cool!
<s> Not all of them!
<s> I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
<s> The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
<s> I insist, it is the least we can do.
<s> Working....Under cover.
<s> You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
<s> Later.
<s> Why?
<s> Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
<s> Yes, if you can get him free.
<s> I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
<s> All the more reason to eliminate him.
<s> Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
<s> I don't want his money.
<s> That's over. Way over.
<s> You're fine like that, Mom.
<s> No. I won't be long.
<s> I meant he's a doctor.
<s> Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
<s> I need to whizz.
<s> Me.
<s> Were?
<s> Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
<s> Why?
<s> Looking for something -- someone.
<s> In 76 years, me neither.
<s> In ten words or less?
<s> Interpreted by another guy like my father.
<s> Belinda's a very jealous person.
<s> And that would ruin your reputation how?
<s> And why would that scare me?
<s> When I have something to say.
<s> Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
<s> No.
<s> You're sometimes not sure?
<s> What would you do up here?
<s> The truth. I just left you out of it.
<s> Lower. Same page.
<s> He wants help with his lines --
<s> Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
<s> Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
<s> No.
<s> I have expectations, too.
<s> That won't be possible.
<s> No.
<s> Like what, sir?
<s> How -- how long does she have?
<s> She did. It was you.
<s> That's right.  The world is your oyster.
<s> Please.
<s> I'd work backstage or something?
<s> Where did you get -- ?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Scalene?
<s> The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
<s> I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
<s> Have we ever met before?
<s> How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
<s> Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
<s> Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
<s> Coming, Eileen...
<s> Why is she gonna get angry with you?
<s> Five cents, please.
<s> What year?
<s> No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
<s> Yeah,  Right.
<s> That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
<s> Is Shemp all right?
<s> The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
<s> Ssshhhhh!
<s> You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
<s> You were ringing the doorbell!
<s> Professor, be serious, would you?
<s> Well, it was there.
<s> Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
<s> Dick? Dick who?
<s> No way!
<s> Hi, Marty!
<s> Well, he's gone.
<s> He said not to tell.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They come with the house.
<s> She plays the clarinet, too.
<s> Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nope.
<s> Mmmmm.
<s> Sure thing. Come on.
<s> I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
<s> What'd you come out here for?
<s> Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
<s> Yeah? Why not?
<s> You love him?
<s> Sure.
<s> There you go.
<s> Something mi trabajo.
<s> Well, I got homework.
<s> It's your play.
<s> There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
<s> Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
<s> How's he doing?
<s> Just looking.
<s> Just to keep him out of the sun.
<s> Positive?
<s> Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Really?
<s> Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
<s> Stay as long as you like.
<s> Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Hold it right there.
<s> They're stealing my chopper!
<s> The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
<s> I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
<s> I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
<s> And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
<s> I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
<s> Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
<s> It?  Who does?
<s> Where's the professor?
<s> At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
<s> What? How do you know that?
<s> John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
<s> Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
<s> Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
<s> Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
<s> Who were you really trying to kill last night?
<s> Pretty terrible shot.
<s> The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
<s> No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
<s> Any time.
<s> What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
<s> Believe in Penny Priddy?
<s> No, sir.  I think the flint...
<s> Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
<s> Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
<s> Please, Barton.
<s> What?! He's a son of a bitch!
<s> If I can. He gets jealous; he-
<s> What are they like? What are they about?
<s> Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
<s> What DID you mean?
<s> I...
<s> What else?
<s> Are you all right?
<s> No, what did it say?
<s> I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
<s> It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
<s> Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
<s> Have you read the Bible, Garland?
<s> Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
<s> See you, Charlie.
<s> Seen a doctor?
<s> Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
<s> Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
<s> You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
<s> Seems like nothing but, lately.
<s> Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
<s> In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
<s> I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
<s> You gotta believe me 
<s> Yeah.
<s> But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
<s> She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
<s> Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
<s> Lou.
<s> CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
<s> KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
<s> Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
<s> Mr. Lipnik.
<s> Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
<s> That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
<s> What do you do, Fink?
<s> No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
<s> Only fry you once.
<s> ...Fred...
<s> Excellent picture.
<s> Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
<s> Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
<s> It's not gonna take long, Sam.
<s> I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
<s> It's bullshit.  You know it is.
<s> No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Why didn't you tell me?
<s> No.  I mean it, thank you.
<s> My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
<s> I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
<s> What did she tell me, Beth?
<s> I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
<s> I know who you are.
<s> No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
<s> Are you arresting me?
<s> I don't smoke.
<s> I found some in my purse; would you like one?
<s> A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
<s> I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
<s> You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
<s> Thanks.
<s> I don't know.  But you do.
<s> Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
<s> Do you?
<s> To see if I can get away with it.
<s> She's seen everything before.
<s> I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
<s> Do you want her to join us sometime?
<s> Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
<s> No?
<s> Try me.
<s> When?
<s> He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
<s> No.
<s> Did you miss me?
<s> What are you researching?
<s> Somebody has to die.
<s> Somebody always does.
<s> What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
<s> I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
<s> I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
<s> Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
<s> Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
<s> Do you remember his name?
<s> Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
<s> What is it you got between you?
<s> Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
<s> She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
<s> She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
<s> He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
<s> She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
<s> Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
<s> Is he dead?
<s> She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
<s> How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
<s> Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
<s> She killed him.
<s> You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
<s> I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
<s> Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
<s> Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
<s> Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
<s> You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
<s> Did you check all four years?
<s> Can you check again?
<s> Can there be some mistake?
<s> No. Should I have?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Do you ever get sick of it?
<s> It's in New Jersey.
<s> I think it's in New Jersey.
<s> Ignorant art?
<s> Yeah, I met her already.
<s> My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
<s> I don't like beer.
<s> We can do better. It needed more white.
<s> You name it, I paint there.
<s> How about right now?
<s> Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
<s> I'm here.
<s> I hate this. Turn that off.
<s> What?
<s> Not black.
<s> We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
<s> Who said that?
<s> No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
<s> Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
<s> Very well.
<s> Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
<s> He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
<s> I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
<s> Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
<s> Party girls? Can I call you?
<s> Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
<s> Well thanks!
<s> I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
<s> That's great.
<s> Hi.
<s> Have a Mac.
<s> Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
<s> No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
<s> Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
<s> I need this?
<s> Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
<s> No, actually I feel worse.
<s> I will relay the message.
<s> I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
<s> "Shreck's."  You --
<s> Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
<s> Yes and no ...
<s> I'm tempted.
<s> And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
<s> I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
<s> Yes and no...
<s> Had one.  Didn't work.
<s> Photojournalist.
<s> Y'mean take off our costumes?
<s> Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
<s> Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
<s> You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
<s> Silent night, violent night...
<s> A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
<s> That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
<s> No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
<s> Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
<s> Coming on line now, sir.
<s> Pheromones?
<s> My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
<s> Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
<s> What exactly are you doing?
<s> Mr. Freeze.
<s> Surf's up.
<s> I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
<s> I can make it.
<s> Me too.  Great stems, though.
<s> A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
<s> Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
<s> People come first, Dr. Isley.
<s> Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
<s> But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
<s> Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
<s> Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
<s> I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
<s> You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
<s> Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
<s> Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
<s> Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
<s> You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
<s> You leave Batman and Robin to me.
<s> Where is my wife?
<s> As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
<s> I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
<s> I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
<s> I've got to stop him.
<s> Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
<s> I think they're getting worse.
<s> Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
<s> I wonder if she'd go out with me.
<s> I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
<s> Ninety-three, including the sauna.
<s> Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
<s> Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
<s> ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
<s> Recognition, of course.
<s> Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
<s> And you are?
<s> Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
<s> I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
<s> We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
<s> Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
<s> Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
<s> Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
<s> Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
<s> Wait. You can't go.
<s> No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
<s> So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
<s> So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Well, I met someone...
<s> So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
<s> Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
<s> I don't want to remember!
<s> Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
<s> Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
<s> Paranoid? The psychotic?
<s> Fred?
<s> ...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
<s> Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
<s> You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
<s> A man with a death wish.
<s> So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
<s> About what?
<s> Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
<s> I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
<s> Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
<s> Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
<s> ... Very good, sir.
<s> WHICH CAR?
<s> ... Where are you taking me?
<s> I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
<s> You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
<s> I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
<s> You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
<s> Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
<s> Maybe we should just kiss.
<s> I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
<s> ... Looks like a convention.
<s> ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
<s> I feel naked without it.
<s> What now?
<s> Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
<s> Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
<s> Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
<s> JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
<s> I've considered that possibility.
<s> That's it.
<s> Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
<s> Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
<s> Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
<s> What?  I improved her a little...
<s> A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
<s> What were you thinking?
<s> Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
<s> Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
<s> His face.  Allie, look at his face.
<s> Oh, Bruce...
<s> ... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
<s> It's gone.
<s> Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
<s> Did you really ask?
<s> I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
<s> 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
<s> Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
<s> Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
<s> Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
<s> Great - keep him out of trouble.
<s> Great news.
<s> Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
<s> Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
<s> Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
<s> A car sounds sensible.
<s> Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
<s> Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
<s> Yes?
<s> Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
<s> Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
<s> The TV.
<s> Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
<s> Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
<s> Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
<s> Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
<s> Me first?
<s> Me first!
<s> Huh huh huh.
<s> Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
<s> Yeah, really.
<s> Cool! Huh huh huh.
<s> Uh... I think you scared them off.
<s> Uh...
<s> Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
<s> What's your problem Beavis?
<s> Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
<s> Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
<s> Uh... butt-snatch...
<s> Yeah, we're gonna score.
<s> Oh, that's nice.
<s> Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
<s> OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
<s> Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
<s> Cut the power!
<s> Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
<s> Deep and hard.
<s> Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
<s> That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
<s> Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
<s> Uh, ten uh...
<s> Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
<s> No, Jane.
<s> Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
<s> That's how long you were gone.
<s> I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
<s> In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
<s> Won't?  Or can't?
<s> They make gypsies look good.
<s> Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<s> We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
<s> I don't know... what are you looking up?
<s> Wait.
<s> We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
<s> She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
<s> I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
<s> I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
<s> ... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
<s> Let's see if she can get my model back.
<s> What makes you think she likes me?
<s> <u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
<s> I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
<s> Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
<s> You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
<s> We tried.
<s> Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
<s> Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
<s> I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
<s> What do you mean?  What's he do?
<s> Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
<s> Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
<s> Step... mother.
<s> I want to get in.
<s> I... I don't know what your name is.
<s> Yes.
<s> It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
<s> Good girrrl!
<s> Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
<s> How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
<s> ... I will.
<s> 
<s> I'm beeyoo-teeful.
<s> That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
<s> Delia hates it.
<s> Let me have it.
<s> I'm lonely.
<s> Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
<s> I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
<s> Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
<s> Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
<s> Otho, can you do it?
<s> They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
<s> Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
<s> That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
<s> Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
<s> I don't know.
<s> That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
<s> My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
<s> Their wedding clothes.
<s> But not for long...
<s> Yes, I will.
<s> Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
<s> No, Robert.
<s> Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
<s> Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
<s> I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
<s> Stay here? Is that necessary?
<s> He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
<s> I have no idea...
<s> Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
<s> Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> There's no need for a hospital.
<s> Yes. I am.
<s> Yes. He's a very careful driver.
<s> My name is Chance.
<s> Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
<s> He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
<s> Yes, so do we.
<s> Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
<s> Yes, Eve. I know that.
<s> Thank you, Eve.
<s> Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
<s> I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
<s> Yes, very well, thank you.
<s> I certainly do.
<s> We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
<s> ... I see.
<s> Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
<s> Yes. You look very sick.
<s> You're looking much better today, Ben.
<s> Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
<s> Yes, Ben - he is.
<s> Yes. I would like to do that.
<s> Yes. I like to watch very much.
<s> I can't write.
<s> I can't read.
<s> Yes. I like to watch.
<s> Yes.
<s> I never needed money.
<s> Yes. Of men and women.
<s> No.
<s> It's very sore.
<s> Yes.
<s> ... Yes. You can take me.
<s> How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
<s> He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
<s> Yes, I'm very hungry.
<s> Yes.
<s> I am a very serious gardener.
<s> Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
<s> Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
<s> No, I do not have any of those.
<s> Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
<s> Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
<s> ... Oh, really...
<s> ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
<s> Try again.
<s> Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
<s> Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
<s> Would you two excuse me for a moment?
<s> No, that won't do any good.
<s> Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
<s> I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
<s> Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
<s> There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
<s> Oh? What?
<s> Thank you, Colonel.
<s> I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
<s> I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
<s> Take care of yourself, Ben.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The one where you're that jewel thief.
<s> Who am I thinking of?
<s> Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
<s> The monkey.
<s> Hmmm.
<s> Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
<s> Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
<s> You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
<s> What?
<s> You've always loved the animals.
<s> We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
<s> What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
<s> It'll never happen, fuckface.
<s> He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
<s> You came up here looking for the portal?
<s> I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
<s> I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
<s> Holy shit! He said what I said!
<s> Forget it.
<s> Yes?
<s> Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
<s> Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
<s> Glooph is not a letter, sir.
<s> Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
<s> Yessir.
<s> Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
<s> Maxine.
<s> My tits?
<s> I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
<s> Well, I'm a puppeteer...
<s> Yikes.
<s> Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
<s> Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
<s> Good. We'll sell tickets.
<s> I'll protect you, Dollface.
<s> I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
<s> You're evil, Maxine.
<s> Ha ha ha!
<s> And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
<s> We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
<s> No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
<s> Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
<s> Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
<s> Fork ah did?
<s> Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
<s> No you mustn't, my child.
<s> My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
<s> That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
<s> Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
<s> A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
<s> Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
<s> Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
<s> You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
<s> No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
<s> It's okay, my sweet.
<s> Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
<s> I've got to leave Malkovich.
<s> Derek Mantini!
<s> I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
<s> Then what do I do?
<s> I'm saying they came into my yard.
<s> What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
<s> I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
<s> The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
<s> NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
<s> That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
<s> No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
<s> No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
<s> Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
<s> I don't. I have my own.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh.
<s> Fine. But what would I do at night?
<s> In case of what?
<s> Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
<s> Extra?
<s> Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
<s> NO!...She wanted me to do it.
<s> But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
<s> He's sleeping in the church.
<s> Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
<s> Ella.
<s> What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
<s> That's so.
<s> Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
<s> She was only-
<s> Who is she? Where she come from?
<s> All he can. All he can.
<s> She left me. She's gone again.
<s> No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
<s> Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
<s> Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
<s> Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
<s> Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
<s> Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
<s> Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
<s> Nothing.
<s> That is for the urn.
<s> Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
<s> I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
<s> Were you listening to the story, Donny?
<s> Were you listening to the Dude's story?
<s> YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
<s> Shut the fuck up, Donny.
<s> Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
<s> I'm shomer shabbas.
<s> Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
<s> Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
<s> That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
<s> Yes, uh, very impressive.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
<s> Color?
<s> ...Also, my rug was stolen.
<s> Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
<s> Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
<s> I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
<s> Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
<s> Yeah man.
<s> Jeffrey Lebowski.
<s> No it's fine, really, uh--
<s> I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
<s> Now I got--
<s> Oh?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
<s> Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
<s> Am I wrong!
<s> Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
<s> You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
<s> Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
<s> Hey Walter--
<s> MARK IT ZERO!
<s> Just, just take it easy, Walter.
<s> Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
<s> The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
<s> It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
<s> What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
<s> Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
<s> The nail polish, Walter.
<s> Not if I have anything to say about it.
<s> Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
<s> And the fucking money!
<s> I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
<s> What the fuck are you talking about?
<s> What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
<s> WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
<s> Yeah.
<s> No Dude.
<s> It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
<s> I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
<s> Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
<s> WHAT?!
<s> You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
<s> Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
<s> Am I wrong!?
<s> They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
<s> You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I'll heal.
<s> Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
<s> Like cancer with a purpose.
<s> Fry 'em.
<s> Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
<s> Sounds like a plan.
<s> Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
<s> Then who does he work for?
<s> Blood...
<s> Thought you were dead.
<s> Not alone.
<s> Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
<s> He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
<s> Getting your attention, Paco.
<s> Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
<s> Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
<s> Just do it, old man.
<s> Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
<s> Wait.
<s> I'm sorry, I --
<s> I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
<s> Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
<s> He didn't. Get over it.
<s> And that's a good thing?
<s> Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
<s> Some. It's been slow --
<s> I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
<s> I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
<s> We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I'm not leaving without you.
<s> For them. But for me --
<s> I don't believe that.
<s> What about the chemistry panel?
<s> Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
<s> That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
<s> I'll take my chances.
<s> How?
<s> Hey, folklore--
<s> --bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
<s> My eye, is there something in my eye?
<s> I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
<s> Bullshit! Talk!
<s> Yes.
<s> Trying to find the energy.
<s> I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
<s> Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
<s> Mrs. Leavitt--
<s> Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
<s> Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
<s> She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
<s> What?
<s> What is <u>this</u>?
<s> --<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
<s> It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
<s> You feel no need to get married or anything.
<s> You said the name "James."
<s> --bullshit!
<s> Get your goddamn--
<s> --Cotter's--
<s> --no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
<s> The, uh, blur there.
<s> I can't let you in.
<s> --go!
<s> Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
<s> Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
<s> Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
<s> Yeah?
<s> No.
<s> Butt-ugly owl.
<s> --coming out of the water--
<s> Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
<s> Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
<s> I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
<s> My room, asleep, last I checked.
<s> Fucking owl!
<s> Anna's the witch.
<s> --turn the camera off--
<s> Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
<s> --great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
<s> What're you nuts--
<s> We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
<s> Ancient runes--
<s> Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
<s> There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
<s> What?
<s> Get some more beer.
<s> They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
<s> She's off her fucking rocker--
<s> --it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
<s> I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
<s> Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
<s> I don't....
<s> I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
<s> Yes.
<s> Meurice--
<s> You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
<s> If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
<s> ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
<s> ...You ever get tired?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Marty.
<s> Isn't that what you want?
<s> I think someone's watching.
<s> Remy.
<s> Thanks.
<s> See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
<s> Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
<s> ...Hell.
<s> Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
<s> I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
<s> You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
<s> Got a job for you.
<s> Ya catch any fish?
<s> It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
<s> Of course.
<s> I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
<s> Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
<s> What.
<s> Meurice...
<s> For what?
<s> You shouldn't have taken the money...
<s> No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
<s> Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
<s> Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
<s> The criminals are winning.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
<s> Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
<s> . mommy's here.
<s> Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
<s> 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
<s> Oh he forced you, huh?
<s> Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
<s> I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
<s> Then you got undressed.
<s> Never before this.
<s> Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
<s> Then don't talk about killing.
<s> Frank? .can you stand up?
<s> There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
<s> . or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
<s> Please. please stay.
<s> Hello.
<s> That's good.
<s> No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
<s> Sometimes I think I do.
<s> Just get outta my bed.
<s> Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
<s> Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
<s> I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
<s> Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
<s> Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
<s> Okay Frank.
<s> Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
<s> I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
<s> Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
<s> I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
<s> There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
<s> My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
<s> Still, it must be kinda rough.
<s> I'm here, aren't I?
<s> You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
<s> It's okay. Don't worry about it.
<s> . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
<s> . Actually. I've been in twice.
<s> I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
<s> You better not, Jeffrey.
<s> You like mysteries that much?
<s> Okay. great!
<s> ... You look beautiful.
<s> Really. you want to dance with someone else?
<s> OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
<s> Go ahead!
<s> For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
<s> Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> Yeah. okay.
<s> Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
<s> That sounds great!
<s> Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
<s> ... Stop it Mike.
<s> I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
<s> Um-hmm.
<s> What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
<s> A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
<s> No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
<s> This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
<s> Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
<s> You happy, baby?
<s> You'll see for yourself.
<s> I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
<s> What?  You're not going to wait for me?
<s> I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
<s> What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
<s> We want some grass.
<s> We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
<s> It's your grass.
<s> We want some grass.
<s> No.
<s> We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
<s> You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
<s> Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
<s> Yeah.  She told me.
<s> I heard.
<s> What?
<s> Because they caught me?
<s> Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
<s> What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
<s> I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
<s> But to the victor belong the spoils.
<s> It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
<s> What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
<s> You went behind my back and you cut me out.
<s> I talked to Foreal, Diego.
<s> Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
<s> Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
<s> You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
<s> That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
<s> Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
<s> Family.
<s> Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
<s> Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
<s> That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
<s> I'm going to California.
<s> ...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
<s> Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
<s> No.
<s> I'll tell her.
<s> That's where you belong...
<s> Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
<s> Tuna.
<s> He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
<s> Why are you smiling?
<s> Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
<s> California.
<s> I'll be here.
<s> Swear on my life.
<s> I know, Dad.  I know...
<s> Not today, George.  Time to go back.
<s> Okay, George.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
<s> Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
<s> This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
<s> Who speaks Spanish?
<s> Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
<s> The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
<s> Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
<s> Third group.
<s> They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
<s> I don't even know your name yet ...
<s> Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
<s> Let's try ...
<s> It's a question of habit ...
<s> No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
<s> But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
<s> Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
<s> It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
<s> I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
<s> Good evening, sir.
<s> Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
<s> No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
<s> Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
<s> Yes ... But let me first see you.
<s> It could've happened to anyone.
<s> So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
<s> She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
<s> What'd he die of?
<s> But there's more?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
<s> Like cats and dogs.
<s> Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
<s> You may call your next witness.
<s> Sit down, Frank.
<s> Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
<s> Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
<s> The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
<s> Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
<s> You get his statement?
<s> No.  I haven't done it in years.
<s> No.
<s> No -- but I can get it for you.
<s> No -- never.
<s> Yes.
<s> Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
<s> We were lovers.
<s> Intense.
<s> I had a bad heart.
<s> I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
<s> Who was your primary beneficiary?
<s> At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
<s> Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
<s> She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
<s> You called him?
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
<s> Then -- those are not your own words?
<s> What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
<s> I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
<s> We dated for about a month last year.
<s> Yes -- he did.
<s> Yes -- cocaine.
<s> He video taped you.
<s> I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Why'd you come here?
<s> Because he called me.
<s> Frank -- what are you doing here?
<s> Sorry.
<s> You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
<s> We're not animals.
<s> I thought the subject was sex?
<s> I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
<s> Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
<s> Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
<s> Is that what you think I was thinking?
<s> It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
<s> Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
<s> I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
<s> Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
<s> That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
<s> Really?
<s> He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
<s> Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
<s> Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
<s> Daddy -- stop it!
<s> What time did you leave?
<s> No -- never.
<s> It's not that long.
<s> Doesn't matter. Move on.
<s> Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
<s> I know. I don't understand it either.
<s> Well, there's a problem.
<s> Michael.
<s> Come here a minute.
<s> Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
<s> "... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
<s> This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
<s> Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
<s> I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
<s> Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
<s> I'll get right on it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's it.
<s> Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
<s> Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
<s> Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
<s> No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
<s> Sure.
<s> Oh. How old?
<s> It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
<s> Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
<s> No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
<s> You get used to it.
<s> No.
<s> I told you, I love other people.
<s> That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
<s> No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
<s> Yes, that'd be nice.
<s> No. I can't. Not yet.
<s> Why?
<s> I sat outside and had coffee.
<s> Near the church.
<s> Trouble. Why?
<s> Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
<s> Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
<s> Then he can move! People move!
<s> What about us? What about me?
<s> I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
<s> I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
<s> Hmm?
<s> What happened?
<s> Cremated?!
<s> Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
<s> Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
<s> Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
<s> Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
<s> Just some flies.
<s> Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
<s> What the hell you talking about?
<s> Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
<s> That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
<s> Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
<s> Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
<s> But that's your old hood, Pops.
<s> Just try it.
<s> Hush, baby.
<s> Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
<s> That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
<s> How did you get in here?
<s> Then fuck it!!!
<s> Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
<s> I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
<s> You moved into this block?
<s> Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
<s> I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
<s> It's alright.  If you want to go home...
<s> My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
<s> I can't find you.
<s> Let me see it.
<s> Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
<s> You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
<s> I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
<s> That's the past.  It's dead.
<s> Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
<s> I didn't sell it.
<s> That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
<s> Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
<s> Not that I remember.
<s> Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
<s> Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
<s> That building?
<s> Should I?
<s> How could that be?  The box was packed!
<s> Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
<s> I can't.  I can't.
<s> Why?  'Cause you know him?
<s> It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
<s> Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
<s> No!  They're still on their way.
<s> Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
<s> Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
<s> Just hurry.
<s> Don't tell him --
<s> Not until he has the money!
<s> You need the money just like we do.
<s> Let us go and we'll make a deal.
<s> Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
<s> It's all right, sir.
<s> No.  Rajeev's in India.
<s> Five.
<s> My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
<s> No.
<s> What?  They ain't there?
<s> Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
<s> Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
<s> Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
<s> The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
<s> Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
<s> Pretty much.  One day at a time.
<s> Truck.  Of course.
<s> Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You have to ask?
<s> Almost five years.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Is that what her daddy tells her?
<s> What about that guy this morning?
<s> Good.
<s> Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
<s> ...  shit.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, twice.
<s> Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
<s> The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
<s> An accident.
<s> If he does ...
<s> What happened?
<s> We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
<s> I'm still here.
<s> You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
<s> Hey.
<s> You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
<s> Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
<s> I think everything is okay.
<s> I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
<s> I thought you were never going to do that.
<s> You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
<s> Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
<s> I'm not asking.
<s> <u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.

<s> We have to go home, Jason.
<s> <u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
<s> I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
<s> One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
<s> Really.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, Jesus... 
<s> It's a little late for that.
<s> Get the fuck away from my car.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> You have blood on your pants.
<s> <u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
<s> I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
<s> I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
<s> What?  Like amnesia?
<s> Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
<s> No.
<s> -- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
<s> I can't believe I slept.
<s> Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
<s> I guess so.
<s> -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
<s> I didn't know this would happen.
<s> I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
<s> Who paid the bill?
<s> I don't know. 
<s> Go back to the hotel.

<s> If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
<s> You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
<s> -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
<s> Abbott wants to talk.
<s> Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
<s> Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
<s> I told you.  You need to rest.
<s> I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
<s> What have you done to my flat?
<s> ... new washer.
<s> ... get to it.
<s> Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
<s> Layton.
<s> Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
<s> Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
<s> No, no ... I did that...
<s> You remember Alison?
<s> I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
<s> Am I?
<s> Not really, no.
<s> You got the wrong man.
<s> You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
<s> Yes. I'm impressed.
<s> Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
<s> Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
<s> {baffled) I don't follow you.
<s> What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
<s> Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
<s> We don't make mistakes.
<s> Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
<s> Do you know what you're doing.
<s> I do. Goodbye. 
<s> Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
<s> Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
<s> Bastard!!!
<s> No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
<s> It's you ... it's you ...
<s> It's my fucking life.
<s> I didn't run away. I left the flat.
<s> What parcel?
<s> Suit me?
<s> You're joking.
<s> Stop it ... damn you!
<s> Go away.
<s> Take care.
<s> Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
<s> What a BITCH!
<s> I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
<s> All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
<s> Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
<s> I'm sorry but ...
<s> {suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
<s> I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
<s> What is it?
<s> This isn't rare!
<s> I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
<s> Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
<s> Mistake?
<s> I know, I know ...!
<s> It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
<s> What? Who is this?
<s> No, sir.
<s> I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
<s> Central Services.
<s> It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
<s> Emergency procedures.
<s> Who fixed your ducts?
<s> Thermostat's gone. And then some.
<s> No. But I can bypass it with one of these
<s> No. Wait here.
<s> I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
<s> Pregnant.
<s> We are virgins.
<s> I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
<s> Dead.
<s> Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
<s> His heart's beating.
<s> I know him. That's Noel.
<s> You never know.
<s> Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
<s> Yes.
<s> Our Lady of Misery.
<s> He's working a double shift.
<s> I think it looks good.
<s> How is she?
<s> I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
<s> Okay.
<s> Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
<s> Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
<s> We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
<s> No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What look?
<s> I quit! I'm through!
<s> No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
<s> Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
<s> Crazy fucker.
<s> Yes.
<s> No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
<s> Yeah. Great, isn't it?
<s> Look out!
<s> I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
<s> It's early for him.
<s> He's crazy. He can't help it.
<s> What?
<s> You're burned out.
<s> Relax, will you.
<s> You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
<s> Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
<s> You really think so?
<s> One more time!
<s> You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
<s> I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
<s> What's wrong with it?
<s> It's not loaded.
<s> The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
<s> Why?  What did they do to you?
<s> Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
<s> Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
<s> Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
<s> I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
<s> I'll see you back at the hotel.
<s> Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
<s> I don't like the word gay.
<s> At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
<s> A half hour in the lobby.
<s> Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
<s> Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
<s> As good as humanly possible.
<s> You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
<s> No.
<s> I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
<s> Yes, I guess.  Yes.
<s> Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
<s> Speaking.
<s> Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
<s> Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
<s> Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
<s> Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
<s> They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
<s> Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
<s> What is she shooting?
<s> We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
<s> Oh, come on -- tell us another.
<s> Almost immediately.
<s> Yes.
<s> Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
<s> I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
<s> I spent a fortune on this.
<s> It's started.
<s> Right there, Bobbie.
<s> Thanks a lot, Buddy.
<s> Honey?...
<s> Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
<s> Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
<s> Fill for a second.
<s> I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
<s> Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
<s> Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
<s> So great -- right?
<s> You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
<s> 'Really a lot appreciate it...'
<s> Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
<s> Billion.
<s> Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
<s> Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
<s> I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
<s> It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
<s> I know.  I taped it.
<s> He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
<s> Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
<s> It just proves that the difference we have are...
<s> What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
<s> I can't be.
<s> I just might.
<s> Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
<s> Shh!
<s> I already told you I'm not.
<s> Anything new?
<s> Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
<s> Honest?
<s> It's a...full length life-size figure!
<s> I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
<s> Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
<s> Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
<s> What are you trying to say?
<s> Why not?!
<s> Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
<s> I hope this was made with egg whites!
<s> That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
<s> I know.
<s> I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
<s> I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
<s> Yeah, right outside the door!
<s> Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
<s> Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
<s> I don't have another cat!
<s> Excuse me I have to make a call...
<s> Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
<s> Yeah I did.
<s> Telling you what?
<s> Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
<s> I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
<s> No thanks.  Sounds good though.
<s> Hiya Maxwell.
<s> I thought you didn't respect money!
<s> That's really nice of you Mayolia.
<s> Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
<s> If you see him.
<s> I was just straightening up the place.
<s> I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
<s> Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
<s> He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
<s> Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
<s> You didn't like them.
<s> You think?  Split?
<s> No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> Hi, guys.
<s> Uum... around ten?
<s> Maybe.
<s> Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
<s> I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
<s> Nothing.  It was just a dream.
<s> Hi.
<s> Jealous?
<s> I do?  I guess I do.
<s> Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
<s> I think you've forgotten something.
<s> It could happen.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
<s> Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
<s> Pretty shallow of you.
<s> I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
<s> Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
<s> Get away from me!
<s> We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
<s> See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
<s> Like my homework.
<s> Why don't we see a movie?
<s> Nice ensemble!
<s> I forgot.
<s> To bring you... your birthright.
<s> I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
<s> China.
<s> I have to show you.
<s> She --
<s> Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
<s> Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
<s> Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
<s> Fine.
<s> It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
<s> A what?
<s> Buffy...
<s> What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
<s> It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
<s> But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
<s> Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
<s> You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
<s> And where are they now?
<s> Hi.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I'm just a girl.
<s> Hi, Grueller.
<s> Could be.
<s> Okay, what else?
<s> Oh, baby!
<s> Buffy?
<s> Oh, please.
<s> Right!
<s> Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
<s> I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
<s> Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
<s> Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
<s> Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
<s> Nuke?!
<s> I know what it is.
<s> Oh--won't YOU come in?
<s> You don't have to...
<s> --but you're father's in there!
<s> I think I'm ready for the Show.
<s> I got lured.
<s> No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
<s> I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
<s> Oh my...  Don't leave...
<s> Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
<s> Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
<s> I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
<s> What's it say?
<s> Ninety-five miles an hour...
<s> Oh let's not...
<s> Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
<s> If you believe in Voodoo.
<s> You missed him!
<s> No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
<s> You spit on me!
<s> Beg me!
<s> You're a cocksucker!
<s> Well, I held it like an egg.
<s> A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
<s> I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

<s> If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
<s> I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
<s> Annie's a smart lady.
<s> The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
<s> I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
<s> It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Yep.  So how's Annie?
<s> Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
<s> Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.

<s> The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
<s> Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
<s> We'll pray anyway.
<s> I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down

<s> Jim looking for somebody.
<s> I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
<s> They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
<s> But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
<s> This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
<s> Good to see ya.  William would you...
<s> I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
<s> He's lying.
<s> ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
<s> It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
<s> It's a pity in this...
<s> ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
<s> Hold on a second.
<s> Speeding?
<s> Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
<s> He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
<s> Yeah, yeah. I know that.
<s> Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
<s> Yeah, sure I do. Why?
<s> I can't! I'm tied!
<s> I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
<s> Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
<s> If his girlfriend was knocked up.
<s> I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
<s> Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
<s> It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
<s> Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
<s> Then he called me a faggot.
<s> I'm sorry about this. Really.
<s> Okay.
<s> Why, somebody's complaining?
<s> Hey, Rich.
<s> Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
<s> I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
<s> Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
<s> What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
<s> I lost control?
<s> What people?
<s> I -
<s> Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
<s> Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
<s> You never - ?
<s> Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
<s> She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
<s> I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
<s> Well, that's why they paid so well.
<s> All right, we're clear.
<s> Why is she eight pounds over?
<s> I...
<s> No. Just stop everything.
<s> Certainly.  Senator.
<s> I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yeah. Yeah.
<s> You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
<s> I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
<s> Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
<s> You can trust me.
<s> Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
<s> What? What?!
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> With what?
<s> Yeah.
<s> But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
<s> Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
<s> Fuck you!
<s> I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
<s> Get out of here!
<s> Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
<s> Mm.
<s> What if he won't stop?
<s> I can back him off.
<s> I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
<s> Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
<s> So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
<s> You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
<s> Eight children! 
<s> That's amazing.
<s> What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
<s> These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
<s> Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
<s> I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
<s> A record of the arrests...
<s> I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
<s> Can't do it with both hands?
<s> Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
<s> I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
<s> Jeff, would you go in with her?
<s> I can't.
<s> Pitch-black?! It -
<s> You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
<s> Yeah?
<s> Nicky, I did -
<s> I did - I didn't -
<s> Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
<s> Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
<s> Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
<s> He's gone?
<s> I'm over here now.
<s> Calm down! Calm down!
<s> Stay out of the way!
<s> What?
<s> Hm.
<s> Ma che cazzo!
<s> He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
<s> Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
<s> Oh, come on.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Bye.
<s> Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
<s> I don't - 
<s> I did what you told me to.
<s> Come on. Don't be scared.
<s> It's what you want?
<s> Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
<s> What about my money?
<s> I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
<s> All right. Be careful.
<s> You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
<s> Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
<s> Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
<s> It means I got the money.
<s> Lester - he called you here.
<s> That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
<s> 'Go! Go! Go!'
<s> She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
<s> You're driving me nuts!
<s> I think that's it.
<s> Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
<s> Two.
<s> Why?
<s> Get up.
<s> Stacy. 
<s> Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
<s> Go fuck yourself.
<s> Oh, he ain't nobody.
<s> Angelo and Buster.
<s> They'll do it.
<s> Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
<s> Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
<s> Charlie M.
<s> How you doin'?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
<s> Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
<s> No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
<s> I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
<s> You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
<s> Then do it the way you want.
<s> Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
<s> Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
<s> Guilty. I am.
<s> I don't know. I can't remember.
<s> What did you think?
<s> You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
<s> Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
<s> I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
<s> I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
<s> A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
<s> They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
<s> Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
<s> Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
<s> It may be time to get the police involved...
<s> I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
<s> Winning.
<s> I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
<s> Even the skylight?
<s> What about "climbing in?"
<s> I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
<s> Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
<s> I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
<s> How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
<s> Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
<s> The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
<s> You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
<s> You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
<s> Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
<s> I actually got some memory back last night.
<s> I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
<s> Actually, yes.
<s> I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
<s> Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
<s> It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
<s> Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
<s> You going to talk all day?
<s> Do I hear a woman's voice?
<s> Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
<s> He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
<s> I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
<s> I'm going to level with you officer.
<s> Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
<s> With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
<s> I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
<s> It's taken care of.
<s> Not this minute.
<s> Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
<s> Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
<s> I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
<s> Allow me.
<s> Give me 20 minutes at least.
<s> I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
<s> You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
<s> They're holding my husband downstairs.
<s> My name is --
<s> Then hang up!  Do it!
<s> I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
<s> Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
<s> He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
<s> How much time do you have left on it?
<s> Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
<s> When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
<s> The City National on San Vincente.
<s> To hide it from the I.R.S.
<s> The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
<s> When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
<s> I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
<s> Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
<s> Shit.  I'm sorry.
<s> Hand me the phone.
<s> It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
<s> I thought it was inspired.
<s> Why pick me to be your "mark?"
<s> He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
<s> You could've hit me.
<s> Stop talking like that!
<s> Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
<s> I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
<s> Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
<s> Some loyalty.
<s> Talk to the man.
<s> I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
<s> Better reassure him.
<s> If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
<s> I suppose you're in your taxi?
<s> You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
<s> Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
<s> Take the 405 south.
<s> Nobody can do anything right but you!
<s> Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
<s> From here on, I dish it out.
<s> How?
<s> See what, Dil?
<s> C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
<s> You heard me --
<s> It's Dave.
<s> Fuck off, Dave.
<s> Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Scottish?
<s> Like treacle.
<s> He's Scottish, Col.
<s> Must be.
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> He wants me to perform for him.
<s> Must be.
<s> How special?
<s> Jesus fucking Christ.
<s> Must be in love to manage that.
<s> Tried to. Sit down, will you?
<s> Something I heard someone say once.
<s> If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
<s> Depends what it is.
<s> Where?
<s> Give it over, Dil --
<s> Shut up.
<s> That's a start.
<s> Please, Jimmy.
<s> I miss you, Jimmy.
<s> Don't be cruel.
<s> Why shouldn't I be jealous?
<s> Yes.
<s> It's a secret.
<s> No.
<s> Only in times of extreme stress.
<s> In a manner of speaking.
<s> He asked me to see were you all right.
<s> Got to be somewhere.
<s> I like you, DIl
<s> Whatever you say, Dil.
<s> Love you, Dil.
<s> I'd do anything for you, Dil.
<s> Will I see you again?
<s> Stop it, Dil --
<s> Fergus.
<s> Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
<s> Horny bastard.
<s> He's hot.
<s> Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
<s> You may be right.
<s> You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
<s> I'm sure.
<s> And who's Dave when he's at home?
<s> Should blow you away, you know that?
<s> You being cynical, Hennessy?
<s> Good. So what do you think?
<s> My pleasure.
<s> I can smell her perfume.
<s> Can't we take it off?
<s> They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
<s> What?
<s> Why did you sign up?
<s> I'll bear that in mind.
<s> Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
<s> Give us a break.
<s> Having a pint in the Rock.
<s> Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
<s> Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
<s> No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
<s> Some kinds of women are...
<s> What does that mean?
<s> The fastest.
<s> You didn't?
<s> You're crazy --
<s> What about it?
<s> Relax -- you're gaining.
<s> Why?
<s> Let's look anyway.
<s> No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
<s> With whom? Where?
<s> Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
<s> There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
<s> Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
<s> I know, but this is all we've got left.
<s> Reggie -- listen to me --
<s> Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
<s> Oh, I see.
<s> But I don't have it.
<s> I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
<s> Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
<s> You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
<s> Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
<s> Can I at least keep the onion soup?
<s> Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
<s> Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
<s> I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
<s> Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
<s> Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
<s> Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
<s> Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
<s> Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
<s> I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
<s> Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
<s> But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
<s> Reggie?
<s> The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
<s> There must be some way.
<s> Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
<s> Oh. 
<s> Maybe.
<s> A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
<s> I'm scared.
<s> Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
<s> Shut the door!
<s> How often do you go through this little ritual?
<s> I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You mean, you're a thief?
<s> And if it is?
<s> Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
<s> I don't know anything.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Is that all? Can I go now?
<s> What should we give him?
<s> Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
<s> Up there! I would put it up there!
<s> I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
<s> The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
<s> Yes.
<s> That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
<s> Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
<s> You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
<s> Don't you understand French?
<s> The man and the woman are married --
<s> Starting tonight?
<s> Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
<s> Where?
<s> How about once more around the park?
<s> What?
<s> A quarter of a million dollars.
<s> That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
<s> He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
<s> I believe what he said.
<s> Yes?
<s> I don't understa--
<s> Wha -- what do you want?
<s> No -- no, I'm don't.
<s> Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
<s> Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
<s> But what?
<s> Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
<s> What?
<s> I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
<s> I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
<s> I never fucked Rod.
<s> Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
<s> Not my imports.
<s> The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
<s> Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
<s> There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
<s> No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
<s> This will relax her.
<s> A bullet to the right cerebellum.
<s> Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
<s> Who's?
<s> Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> What?
<s> I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
<s> You know about that too?
<s> Really?
<s> Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
<s> I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
<s> Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
<s> You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
<s> You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
<s> What?
<s> Everyone's getting ready for the party.
<s> So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
<s> I did.
<s> Yeah. I think it's really sick.
<s> I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
<s> Yes?
<s> Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
<s> And the police did nothing?
<s> The principal?
<s> His mother's side.
<s> There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
<s> And she didn't?
<s> Did you want one?
<s> You're the one who's hand is shaking.
<s> Ok.
<s> I'm not leaving it here.
<s> Told you to hide it.
<s> If sheep don't count.

<s> Oh...

<s> Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
<s> Except for the fact that I need cash.
<s> Hang on.  Hang on.
<s> ...and a shitload of ice.
<s> ...-er.
<s> You want cash?
<s> I need your truck!
<s> ...all the time.
<s> ...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
<s> You'd better coast through...
<s> 
<s> No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
<s> To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
<s> ...-er.

<s> You know what I'm sayin'?
<s> We were nationally  ranked.
<s> Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
<s> ...hospital.
<s> Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
<s> Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
<s> To tell you the truth, you didn't.
<s> I mean, if that gun was...

<s> Ooh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hey, be cool.
<s> To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
<s> Listen, shithead!
<s> Three seconds.  One...

<s> I think I gave it to her.
<s> Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
<s> Yeah.
<s> When was the last time?
<s> I've got her.
<s> With her mother.
<s> That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
<s> Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
<s> Do you remember the figures we discussed?
<s> You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
<s> Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
<s> Curly, where's your car?
<s> Where's that?
<s> Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
<s> Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
<s> Since when?
<s> Oh yes.
<s> No.
<s> I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
<s> What for?
<s> Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
<s> Gee, thanks, Lou.
<s> Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
<s> What are you having?
<s> Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
<s> Mrs. Mulwray?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
<s> More like other people putting their business in my nose.
<s> No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
<s> Yes. He never forgave him for it.
<s> What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...A flaw...
<s> It has to do with my father.
<s> That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
<s> What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
<s> What did you do that for?
<s> Back to Mexico.
<s> Where can we go?
<s> With us.
<s> Okay...
<s> He didn't wear bifocals.
<s> Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
<s> I think I got something.
<s> Oh no.
<s> We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
<s> Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
<s> Help yourself.
<s> Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
<s> Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
<s> That's like saying they're in Arizona.
<s> Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
<s> When it comes? What'd you tell him?
<s> Drowned, too.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Mr. Gittes...
<s> Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
<s> Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
<s> He owned it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
<s> I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
<s> Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
<s> No, you have a press agent do it.
<s> She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
<s> You must be thinking of a different daughter.
<s> She ran away?
<s> Why'd she run away?
<s> We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
<s> Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
<s> Toto, come here.
<s> Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
<s> Why? What do you mean?
<s> What's she like? What's she like?...
<s> What you say is wonderful! But sad...
<s> Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
<s> Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
<s> Elena. My name's Elena.
<s> Hi. Why are you running?
<s> That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
<s> Who?
<s> One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
<s> Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
<s> It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
<s> OK...
<s> I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
<s> I didn't see that.
<s> Oh!
<s> We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
<s> I'm going back there.
<s> Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
<s> Who said anything about brooms?
<s> Charlie?!
<s> Certainly not.
<s> I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
<s> Don't I always?  Most of the time?
<s> Yes.
<s> Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
<s> Hello, Bernstein.
<s> That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
<s> Yes - Mr. Kane.
<s> Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
<s> The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
<s> Emily -
<s> I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
<s> There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
<s> Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
<s> He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
<s> I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
<s> I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
<s> Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
<s> You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
<s> Charlie, please don't -
<s> I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
<s> No.  But you're close.
<s> Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
<s> You're my wife, Susan, and -
<s> We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
<s> Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
<s> You can't.
<s> Can you prove it isn't?
<s> Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir. 
<s> It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
<s> How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
<s> Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
<s> I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
<s> Why, Brad?
<s> No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
<s> She's going to leave you -
<s> Are you finished?
<s> Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
<s> I know you will.
<s> I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
<s> Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
<s> That's the train with all the lights.
<s> That's what you think, is it, Jim?
<s> You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
<s> Was he in love?
<s> Yes.
<s> Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
<s> We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
<s> Millions - if anybody wants it.
<s> Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
<s> If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
<s> What did you get?
<s> What about that apartment?
<s> Rosebud?
<s> He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
<s> It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
<s> You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
<s> Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
<s> I take it she likes the guy.
<s> Can I join in?
<s> Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
<s> Exactly.
<s> Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
<s> You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
<s> Awww. That was so cute.
<s> It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
<s> You two better quit it.
<s> I feel nauseous.
<s> No, don't!
<s> Dante. You've got a customer.
<s> What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
<s> No, you're not really getting married?
<s> You lie.
<s> I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
<s> We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
<s> Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
<s> You have a better suggestion?
<s> I'm just kidding.
<s> I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
<s> Like what?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
<s> In a second!
<s> Yes.
<s> I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
<s> What's your point?
<s> If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
<s> Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
<s> Shocking abuse of authority.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> You called Caitlin again?
<s> You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
<s> There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
<s> Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
<s> Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
<s> You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
<s> Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
<s> I don't back down.
<s> I'm going to miss the game.
<s> Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
<s> No argument here. Insubordination rules.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
<s> You've had sex with a dead person.
<s> It's today.
<s> But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
<s> Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
<s> Twenty-two; same as us.
<s> An embarrassing way to die.
<s> Bible truth.
<s> My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
<s> Balls resting on his lips.
<s> It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
<s> Exactly.
<s> I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
<s> Because I'm happy.
<s> I'm happy.
<s> No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
<s> She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
<s> Watch the store while I go home and change.
<s> Shut the fuck up!
<s> WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
<s> Why do I have this life?
<s> I should shit or get off the pot.
<s> You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
<s> What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
<s> What time did you get to work today?
<s> Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
<s> You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
<s> All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
<s> I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
<s> I'm her sister.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
<s> Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
<s> The difference is you exploit a weakness.
<s> You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
<s> I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
<s> So I'm told.
<s> I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
<s> Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
<s> Something wrong?
<s> Twelve.
<s> You're a pig.
<s> Three including you.
<s> I'm not the pig you are.
<s> Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
<s> Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
<s> Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
<s> That's because I never had sex with him!
<s> Dante...
<s> Um. Thirty-seven.
<s> I love you. Don't feel sick.
<s> Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
<s> I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
<s> Sure.
<s> If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
<s> I don't want to go back with her...
<s> I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
<s> An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
<s> Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
<s> I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
<s> My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
<s> That's tight. Solid.
<s> Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
<s> I hope it feels good.
<s> Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
<s> You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
<s> Twenty bucks.
<s> Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
<s> How yo doin', Gabe!
<s> More bang for the buck.
<s> They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
<s> Hal will have my head for this.
<s> I copy.
<s> Bags?
<s> Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
<s> I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
<s> Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
<s> Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
<s> Look, I know--
<s> Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
<s> Would you?
<s> You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
<s> Is it really four thousand?
<s> One...
<s> I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
<s> Help me!  I don't want to die!
<s> After the funeral I just had to leave.
<s> Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
<s> I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
<s> You couldn't.
<s> --mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
<s> What are you doing here!?
<s> For the same reason you did, to help.
<s> Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
<s> You attacked me.
<s> We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
<s> Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
<s> This rope is sixty years old!
<s> Never
<s> I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
<s> Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
<s> Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
<s> I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
<s> Forget it!  I refuse!
<s> Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
<s> Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
<s> There is.
<s> I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
<s> Anyone else following?
<s> There.  You blind?
<s> Who's going with you?
<s> Where's the rest of the team?
<s> Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
<s> Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
<s> The monitor! I never ask twice.
<s> Ask the questions.
<s> There, what's that place?
<s> What about it?
<s> Then go fetch.
<s> Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
<s> Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
<s> Impossible... I don't believe it.
<s> No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
<s> A cup of the old chai, sir?
<s> You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
<s> Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
<s> That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
<s> I did, sir.
<s> Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
<s> No, sir, I feel really great.
<s> Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
<s> I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
<s> We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
<s> Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
<s> Keeping fit then?
<s> Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
<s> Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
<s> Murder, sir.
<s> Fair hair, sir.
<s> Blue eyes, yes, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> We're going to friends now, sir.
<s> Vitamins will it be then?
<s> You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
<s> Fine. Fine.
<s> Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
<s> Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
<s> It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
<s> You're not cured yet, my boy.
<s> They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
<s> Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
<s> That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
<s> Amen. They cross themselves.
<s> Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
<s> It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.

<s> Four in this block, sir.
<s> I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
<s> No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
<s> What?
<s> You got a deal.
<s> No.  I got lucky with the lights.
<s> Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
<s> This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
<s> You psychic?
<s> Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
<s> When was the last time you took one?
<s> No, no, <u>wait</u>...
<s> Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
<s> Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
<s> 'Fraid so.
<s> I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
<s> Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
<s> So?
<s> So?  It was a random thing.
<s> This isn't our goddamn game!
<s> What's he sayin'?
<s> Yo, whassup?
<s> I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
<s> Let's not get excited, sir.
<s> Who is this?
<s> Yeah, yeah, sorry...
<s> An apology.
<s> I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
<s> No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
<s> The trunk?
<s> It's not me.
<s> I tried it.
<s> I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
<s> Play music.
<s> You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
<s> Lenny, my dispatcher.
<s> Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> I'm done.  Find another cab.
<s> Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
<s> What happened?
<s> It's not bullshit.
<s> See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
<s> No.
<s> No, not just that.
<s> Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
<s> One more.
<s> Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
<s> I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
<s> Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
<s> So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
<s> I can't promise you anything.
<s> I think you're different.
<s> No.
<s> You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
<s> Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
<s> What is?
<s> You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
<s> As opposed to?
<s> Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
<s> Surprise me.
<s> This would be it?
<s> 'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
<s> Pretty scary, huh?
<s> Who?
<s> Never heard of him.
<s> Getting rid of my hub!
<s> Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
<s> Where'd you get your subscribers?
<s> There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
<s> Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
<s> His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
<s> They're big details, Jerry.
<s> If that's what you want.  Yes.
<s> What?
<s> I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
<s> Jerry, I --
<s> Thanks.
<s> Come on.
<s> Did you kill him?
<s> He gave it to me.
<s> Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
<s> It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
<s> Where are you?
<s> I can't promise you anything.
<s> You think it's a conspiracy?
<s> Now she tells me.
<s> That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
<s> You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
<s> Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
<s> It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
<s> And what did I say?
<s> If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
<s> Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
<s> Then this is a goddamn emergency.
<s> This doesn't make sense.
<s> -- Understood.
<s> You don't understand --
<s> No.  Not yet.
<s> Yeah, I do.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Where do you think Jerry is?
<s> I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Ellie?
<s> Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
<s> What?
<s> All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
<s> Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
<s> 'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
<s> You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
<s> Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
<s> Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
<s> As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
<s> What would you have me say, David?
<s> Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
<s> We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
<s> I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
<s> Put it on speakers.
<s> NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> It's a civilian facility.
<s> Is that your official response?
<s> Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
<s> Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
<s> I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
<s> We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
<s> Now... you go home.
<s> But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
<s> Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
<s> No.  Please.
<s> The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
<s> That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
<s> It's so... small.
<s> Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
<s> I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
<s> The systems integration site.
<s> Yavol.
<s> Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
<s> What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
<s> Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
<s> I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
<s> It's really happening.
<s> Wait -- hold on a minute --
<s> Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
<s> That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
<s> Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
<s> Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
<s> Now you know.
<s> If you came back.
<s> I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
<s> What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
<s> I'm sorry -- I can't --
<s> I can't do this --
<s> I can't hear this now --
<s> I'm not sure it's come to that.
<s> Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
<s> Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
<s> Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
<s> Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
<s> Recommendations?
<s> Have your department make a full report.
<s> We work down in the ditch?
<s> I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
<s> We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
<s> Ram it in and break it off!
<s> You steal a car?
<s> I don't know, Boss.
<s> Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
<s> I'll give you fifty cents.
<s> Hey, Tattoo!
<s> I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
<s> A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
<s> A Lucas Jackson.
<s> Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
<s> Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
<s> Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
<s> That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
<s> That's what you're gonna have to do.
<s> Fifty's a nice round number.
<s> Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
<s> You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
<s> Like an elephant.
<s> Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
<s> Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
<s> We ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
<s> One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
<s> Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
<s> Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
<s> Call.
<s> I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
<s> Kick a buck.
<s> That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
<s> Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
<s> But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
<s> You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
<s> Only kidding!
<s> Fear of what...
<s> Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
<s> Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
<s> No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
<s> Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
<s> Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
<s> But </u>alive</u>!
<s> Tell her about <u>what</u>?
<s> Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
<s> What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
<s> And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
<s> Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
<s> The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
<s> I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
<s> We know...  Send the book to evidence...
<s> She don't want it.
<s> You know I can't do that.
<s> You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<s> He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
<s> Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
<s> Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
<s> You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
<s> Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
<s> Well, thanks.
<s> He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
<s> I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
<s> Is there a phone booth there?
<s> She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
<s> Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
<s> Because it's your job, that's all.
<s> You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
<s> Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
<s> It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
<s> Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
<s> Helen... excuse me, we...
<s> It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
<s> Or the F.B.I.?
<s> Give me Ruben back...
<s> ...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
<s> No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
<s> I'll listen for you buzzing over.
<s> Outside in the visitors, car park.
<s> Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
<s> It does.
<s> He's very pale. Covered with scars.
<s> No. But when he's in that car...
<s> I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
<s> Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
<s> The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
<s> I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
<s> Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
<s> It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
<s> A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
<s> You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
<s> Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
<s> I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
<s> We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
<s> Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
<s> What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
<s> Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
<s> I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
<s> I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
<s> Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
<s> Please, Letty.
<s> Really?
<s> You look beautiful.
<s> Do you think I should?
<s> Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
<s> I'll be back before you can say souffle.
<s> Oh, no, of course not.
<s> You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
<s> I know.    I know.
<s> Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
<s> You've only known Jake a few months.
<s> Paul could pop the question at any time.
<s> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
<s> And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
<s> I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
<s> Mom, please.
<s> Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
<s> A deal's a deal.
<s> I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
<s> I'm glad.
<s> I answered these questions last night.
<s> Terrific.
<s> Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
<s> Who do you think you are?
<s> I wasn't hungry.
<s> Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
<s> OK, OK, I'll give it back.
<s> I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
<s> Exactly.
<s> What are the delusions like?
<s> I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
<s> How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
<s> Michael, I...
<s> I better make a list.
<s> I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
<s> Shhhh.
<s> I'll be forced to tickle you.
<s> You got wine. That's great.
<s> No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
<s> And all the plans we have.
<s> Well then why'd it happen?
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
<s> It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
<s> Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
<s> I mean tonight.
<s> Sure. Of course.
<s> I'm calling in sick.
<s> No, it's not like that.
<s> Yes.
<s> You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
<s> I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
<s> I've met someone else.
<s> It doesn't matter who.
<s> He's a patient here.
<s> I think I've heard this speech before.
<s> If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
<s> You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
<s> They don't have a murder weapon?
<s> When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
<s> Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
<s> You'll never get out of the city.
<s> Oui.
<s> Good.   I'm good.
<s> No thank you.
<s> I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
<s> I'm not here to negotiate.
<s> I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
<s> Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
<s> Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
<s> I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
<s> I assume you want something?
<s> Half the tapes.
<s> How about if I call you?
<s> Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
<s> You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
<s> You want Zero to kill him?
<s> And the Vodka.
<s> You didn't buy batteries?
<s> Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
<s> You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
<s> What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
<s> Good idea.
<s> Has to be.
<s> Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
<s> If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
<s> I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
<s> I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
<s> I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
<s> Okay boss.   Where are they?
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.
<s> A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
<s> Okay.    I will have a beer.
<s> This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
<s> I'm the driver.
<s> Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
<s> I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
<s> Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
<s> The baseball is mine.
<s> They sort of got away.
<s> The hell it is.
<s> Cool.
<s> It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
<s> -- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
<s> Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
<s> How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
<s> We don't know that for sure.
<s> So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
<s> I don't remember.    I was drunk.
<s> The lucky ones.
<s> I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
<s> Stick around and find out.
<s> -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
<s> She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
<s> I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
<s> I do as I please.
<s> Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
<s> That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
<s> If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
<s> I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
<s> I have a guest.
<s> You're too young to understand.
<s> How so?
<s> Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
<s> I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
<s> Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
<s> Not another lecture!  On guard!
<s> Kneel!
<s> My comb!
<s> Give it back.
<s> It has.  How's business?
<s> Fine.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
<s> Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
<s> That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
<s> She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
<s> Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
<s> Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
<s> Shu Lien...
<s> My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
<s> That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
<s> A murderer?
<s> A female criminal!  Now that's news!
<s> Father!
<s> Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
<s> Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
<s> Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
<s> When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
<s> Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
<s> Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
<s> You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
<s> I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
<s> The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
<s> How 'bout the morgue?
<s> I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
<s> Fun -- look at that guy...
<s> I dabble.  May I?
<s> A remembrance.  A closure.
<s> She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
<s> I think he's yours, now.
<s> I went to see a friend of mine.
<s> Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
<s> Another jolly nickname?
<s> A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
<s> I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
<s> You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
<s> Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
<s> Shelly?
<s> Go away.
<s> One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
<s> I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
<s> Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
<s> That's right.
<s> Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
<s> Forever.
<s> On my mother's life.
<s> That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
<s> Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
<s> What'cha reading?
<s> No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
<s> Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
<s> Why not?
<s> I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
<s> No thank you.
<s> I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
<s> Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
<s> What?
<s> Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Oh please.
<s> You must take me for a real idiot.
<s> Yes it does.
<s> I can't win with you.
<s> I do not.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
<s> I love you.
<s> You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
<s> What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
<s> I'm sorry about that.
<s> Don't think it's not going to cost you.
<s> Okay.
<s> Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
<s> No.
<s> Best friends.
<s> It's Kathryn.
<s> Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
<s> I did?
<s> I don't love him. I love Ronald.
<s> How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
<s> Just taking your photo.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> I swear.
<s> I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
<s> Some other time, Cecile.
<s> For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
<s> Good night Cecile.
<s> Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
<s> Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
<s> Really? Care to make a wager on that?
<s> What, nervous I'm going to win?
<s> Honey, is something wrong?
<s> Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
<s> Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
<s> You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
<s> I told you I don't know.
<s> Likewise I'm sure.
<s> But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
<s> Racist piece of shit.
<s> So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
<s> Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
<s> Shut up and turn to page 64.
<s> Care to make a wager on that?
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> Blow me.
<s> But who will they turn to for help?
<s> Have you succeeded in your task?
<s> I'm aware.
<s> Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
<s> Kind of.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
<s> I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
<s> Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
<s> Screening calls. Any suggestions?
<s> Thank you. Now, where were we?
<s> Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
<s> Come again?
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> I hope I didn't keep you from something.
<s> It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
<s> Oh please. I can't have you do that.
<s> Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
<s> Do you know where she is?
<s> Eight o'clock. You got to go.
<s> You're a lucky guy.
<s> It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
<s> Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
<s> That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
<s> How?
<s> But it's already come true.
<s> Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
<s> I think I should.  3000W?
<s> I live right here.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
<s> Daddy, it's true.
<s> You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
<s> This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
<s> This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
<s> Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
<s> I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
<s> No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
<s> Whenever you want.
<s> That one's an elm.
<s> But we don't have any sea weed.
<s> Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
<s> A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
<s> It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
<s> But she's such a nice lady.
<s> It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
<s> But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
<s> Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
<s> But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
<s> But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
<s> If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Why hasn't he got a head?
<s> Don't you hear it?
<s> My daughter died long ago.
<s> My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
<s> Yes...yes, that's true.
<s> It was pale...a shadowed gold.
<s> I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
<s> That's from her -- that woman.
<s> That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
<s> What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
<s> Yeah but they looked cool...
<s> I've been working out.
<s> It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
<s> Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
<s> What does that have to do with me?
<s> Anything's better than Mark.
<s> What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
<s> Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
<s> They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
<s> To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
<s> Did I kill him? Of course not!
<s> I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
<s> I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
<s> My vision got worse again.
<s> Rule one: always wear make-up.
<s> It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
<s> Okay. I guess so.
<s> I still thought it was a purse.
<s> There is a man's arm in my bed.
<s> I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
<s> Okay, I gotta go.
<s> Why not? There's been a murder.
<s> You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
<s> I could smell another woman on him.
<s> You should have seen it erect.
<s> Hide him.
<s> I think I already have.
<s> I guess you'll find out.
<s> Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
<s> Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
<s> So you're Grant's secretary?
<s> Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
<s> I really gotta pee.
<s> I didn't have to pee then.
<s> That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
<s> Yes I do have to pee!
<s> So pay them back and apologize.
<s> You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
<s> My bra is my biggest supporter.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Take your shower.
<s> Are you following me?
<s> I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
<s> No really, I love knowing what people read.
<s> I can forgive you a bestseller.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
<s> Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
<s> NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
<s> No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
<s> Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
<s> I love you too.
<s> I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
<s> I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
<s> Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
<s> I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
<s> Okay.
<s> Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
<s> You got a dog?
<s> How big?
<s> She's just so... pathetic.
<s> Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
<s> Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
<s> Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
<s> Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
<s> You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
<s> This one walk you home too?
<s> Like a vampire or some shit?
<s> Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
<s> Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
<s> The other one?
<s> Loose ends?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> I see...
<s> <u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
<s> Why are they after you?
<s> I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
<s> It must be a closet or something.
<s> You seem restless.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well...
<s> Nothing.  I don't know anything!
<s> Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
<s> Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
<s> What?
<s> No more than the usual.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> Great.
<s> It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
<s> ... Alright.
<s> `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
<s> You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
<s> Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
<s> Fine.
<s> I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
<s> Exactly. A condition.
<s> And...
<s> Clean.
<s> We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
<s> Are you out of your mind?
<s> Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
<s> Dave -- I'm working.
<s> Why would they do that.  They hired me.
<s> Extend things?
<s> Oh, yeah... probably...
<s> I'm afraid so.
<s> I'm not sure... I might have.
<s> I see what you mean.
<s> 'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
<s> She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
<s> Fine.
<s> We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
<s> Wrong...
<s> Does it make the cars any better?
<s> So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
<s> All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah... Sometimes they do.
<s> What?
<s> I can't say.
<s> Of course.
<s> What about it?
<s> Well...
<s> I'm outta here.
<s> He wasn't always like that, anyway.
<s> Yeah... Bedtime.
<s> Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
<s> Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
<s> Yeah, well... It's finally over.
<s> ... Not exactly the Oval Office.
<s> Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
<s> We're working on it.
<s> There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
<s> Look.
<s> Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
<s> That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
<s> It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
<s> We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
<s> I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
<s> That sounds like a curse to me.
<s> I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
<s> That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
<s> Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
<s> I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
<s> Come on. Let's go.
<s> What you wanna do?
<s> They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
<s> You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
<s> I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
<s> And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
<s> You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
<s> Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
<s> For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
<s> My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
<s> Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
<s> Will do.
<s> Knox?
<s> Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
<s> At Chet Danburry's house.
<s> It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
<s> And English, and trig
<s> I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
<s> Why? Nobody knows who we are.
<s> So much the better.
<s> So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
<s> So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
<s> Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
<s> All right.  I'll second that.
<s> Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
<s> Sort of.
<s> Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
<s> But, Chris...
<s> Knox!  what are you doing here?
<s> Are you going with Chet?
<s> Then come with me.
<s> My Word
<s> Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
<s> Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
<s> I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
<s> A barbaric yawp.
<s> Yawp!
<s> A madman.
<s> A crazy madman.
<s> Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
<s> You have another choice.
<s> What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
<s> I'm calling her!
<s> Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
<s> Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
<s> Thanks but  I'd better do history.
<s> I don't want to read.
<s> They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
<s> So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
<s> Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
<s> Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
<s> I guess.
<s> Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
<s> what?
<s> This play?
<s> Boat or no boat...I'm going...
<s> Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
<s> Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
<s> How soon can we get up and running?
<s> And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
<s> Dead.
<s> That's where my boat's moored.
<s> Just trying to get to my boat...
<s> Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
<s> Hey! I didn't have to come back.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> Keep tasting...
<s> Soon as I get over the heart attack...
<s> No...
<s> You ain't giving the orders here!
<s> So?
<s> Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
<s> Joey...
<s> Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
<s> Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
<s> Line it up now, nice and easy...
<s> Joey...
<s> Nowhere...
<s> You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
<s> Hey! Come out here!
<s> She fucked you?
<s> Damn right!
<s> John,we're going huntin'.
<s> We're all going.
<s> Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
<s> Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
<s> Yeah, Sal--
<s> Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
<s> I know! I fuckin' know!
<s> She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
<s> Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
<s> Jesus!
<s> No.
<s> You are frightened, no?
<s> Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
<s> Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
<s> You know a guy named Merle?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Who's got the ammo?
<s> Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
<s> Nick, she won't say why.
<s> Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
<s> Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
<s> Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
<s> Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
<s> Nick.
<s> I know.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
<s> You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
<s> Hunt with Vince?
<s> What are you, God?
<s> You wanna bet?
<s> How much? How much do you wanna bet?
<s> What do you mean, no???
<s> Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
<s> That's my plan.
<s> John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
<s> Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
<s> I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
<s> But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
<s> Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure.
<s> Technothugs?
<s> Avon Lady!
<s> Fuck you - fuck you.
<s> Your mother.
<s> Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
<s> We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
<s> I'm not voting for you.
<s> Remember my promise.
<s> You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
<s> Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
<s> We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
<s> You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
<s> Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
<s> I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Simulated one.
<s> We're partners, aren't we?
<s> I'm here.
<s> No you don't.
<s> And you should be with your family.
<s> They always are.
<s> My granddad was a policeman.
<s> Jabez! Careful --
<s> No, thank you -- what's your name?
<s> That's my problem, Belle.
<s> Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
<s> It hasn't opened yet?
<s> Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
<s> I did not, Grandma.
<s> I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
<s> I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
<s> Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
<s> Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
<s> That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
<s> Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
<s> Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
<s> But what becomes of our souls?
<s> Opportunities?
<s> Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
<s> You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
<s> Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
<s> Ten throws it is.
<s> Well, I --
<s> Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
<s> Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
<s> Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
<s> You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
<s> Not all of it?
<s> You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
<s> Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
<s> No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
<s> Jabez!
<s> Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
<s> Jabez --
<s> But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
<s> Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
<s> I am going to lock him up.
<s> He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
<s> It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
<s> Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
<s> Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
<s> All right, son -- if it helps.
<s> I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
<s> Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
<s> My son! Do you really think, Ma....
<s> Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
<s> I say -- it don't matter.
<s> Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
<s> I guess we won't.
<s> Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
<s> Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
<s> You aren't angry with me?
<s> Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
<s> Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
<s> Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
<s> H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
<s> Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
<s> I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
<s> You can talk to me ...
<s> It's corny, but I could live with it.
<s> Ellis, what have you told them?
<s> Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
<s> He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
<s> He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
<s> If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
<s> It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
<s> Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
<s> Go fuck yourself.
<s> Only if New Jersey counts.
<s> I told you...
<s> Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
<s> * Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
<s> The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
<s> Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
<s> Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
<s> Sure.  Follow me.
<s> No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
<s> Don't I always?
<s> Holly Gennero?
<s> Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
<s> Thanks...partner.
<s> I...I shot a kid.
<s> Yessir.
<s> I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
<s> They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
<s> Come on, what's under this?
<s> Yes, I would.
<s> Heidi, I'm dying.
<s> Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
<s> Don't call yourself fat.
<s> Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
<s> It's okay... it's okay...
<s> Yeah, well I don't blame him.
<s> I'm really shakey.
<s> You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
<s> I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
<s> I like that... yeah!
<s> Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
<s> Are they on the phone still?
<s> All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
<s> What are you doin' in there?
<s> This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
<s> They're okay.
<s> Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
<s> Call me whatever you want.

<s> Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
<s> Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
<s> Sonny, come on out!
<s> I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
<s> There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
<s> What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
<s> I can take care of that.
<s> It's all we got.
<s> Believe me, I'm on your side.
<s> Gimme the keys to get outta here!
<s> I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
<s> What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
<s> You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
<s> We like you, too.
<s> Why not?
<s> No.  I had some legal training, but...
<s> Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
<s> You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
<s> Yes...
<s> Get 'em in the vault!
<s> How'd that happen?
<s> I want him to think that.
<s> Get over there!
<s> He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
<s> Okay.
<s> I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
<s> You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
<s> I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
<s> I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
<s> We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
<s> What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
<s> Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
<s> What'll you do?  Come out.
<s> Doing what?
<s> <i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
<s> <i>Morning.</i>
<s> <i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>

<s> What about your toe?
<s> What?
<s> <i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<s> <i>What is it?</i>
<s> My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
<s> <i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
<s> <i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
<s> You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
<s> Yep.
<s> <i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.

<s> That's the rumor on the street.
<s> <i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
<s> Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
<s> Take us to Vegas.
<s> Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>
<s> Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
<s> Must you use that awful word?
<s> Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
<s> You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
<s> He said... take his right arm.
<s> Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
<s> You got my back.
<s> My brother.
<s> Yes?
<s> Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
<s> If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
<s> Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
<s> Did you ask Sal?
<s> What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
<s> What?
<s> Ask Sal.
<s> A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
<s> Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
<s> I didn't.
<s> I'm getting paid...
<s> I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
<s> I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
<s> That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
<s> That's my name.
<s> Can ya dig it?
<s> Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
<s> You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
<s> Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
<s> Here, you gotta delivery.
<s> You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
<s> Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
<s> Quit bullshitting.
<s> Gotta go.
<s> I can run out and get it.
<s> Then we'll do something else.
<s> Trust me.
<s> I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
<s> Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
<s> To get my money.
<s> Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
<s> You're still late.
<s> Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
<s> Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
<s> You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
<s> I understand.
<s> I love you, Black.
<s> Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
<s> I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
<s> I like Mookie a lot.
<s> I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
<s> Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
<s> Tell Pino.
<s> I'm gonna kill somebody today.
<s> Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
<s> HARRY Dunne.
<s> Heddo Jeth-ica.
<s> We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
<s> Yeah...
<s> That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
<s> Well la de da.
<s> It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
<s> Is it okay if he spends the night?
<s> Probably because we've never met.
<s> Is that what I think it is?
<s> How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
<s> The principal.
<s> The second R is silent.
<s> Now that's more of what we're looking for.
<s> Go fish.
<s> What?
<s> She did not.
<s> LLOYD, she's my mom.
<s> Shut up!
<s> You're not my real dad.
<s> Shut Up! Buttlick!
<s> The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
<s> And my mouph is frozen.
<s> Our own special bus.
<s> You and me? Dream on, desperado.
<s> Just wanted to see how your doing.
<s> I'm sure you're overreacting.
<s> So, have you given him "some" yet? 
<s> No. What happened?
<s> I know I did.
<s> D2.
<s> No. Look.
<s> I lugged it all over town!
<s> It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
<s> Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
<s> She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
<s> Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
<s> He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
<s> And with that complete loser
<s> That's the one I wanted.
<s> That's gross.
<s> Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
<s> One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
<s> You're just jealous.
<s> Duh. I'm in your class at school.
<s> Can you believe it?
<s> You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
<s> We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
<s> So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
<s> How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
<s> We start our own class?
<s> And...?
<s> No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
<s> Everything. Just for the record.
<s> The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
<s> Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
<s> No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
<s> Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
<s> We felt his presence.
<s> Is this what you seek?
<s> Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
<s> Paul!!  Paul!!
<s> They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
<s> That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
<s> My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
<s> Where are we do you think?
<s> You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
<s> I'm ready.
<s> Yes...
<s> No one. It... seemed the proper way.
<s> Always.
<s> What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
<s> Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
<s> The most lethal poison in the Universe.
<s> Long live the fighters!
<s> You feel the flesh crisping?
<s> Not all of them... I know which ones will.
<s> Did they try and fail?
<s> My father sent you to test me. Music then?
<s> Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
<s> No.  I never drink -- wine.
<s> No.
<s> Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
<s> I have no next picture.
<s> The <u>women</u>?
<s> Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
<s> I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Ah, so I pull the strings!
<s> BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
<s> But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
<s> Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
<s> That's good.  I could use the money.
<s> Ah!  This is very exciting.
<s> Nah.  This happens all the time...
<s> Goulash.
<s> Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
<s> So how'd we do?
<s> This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
<s> Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
<s> Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
<s> I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
<s> Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
<s> It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
<s> Formaldehyde.
<s> Really?  I don't feel so great.
<s> Has anyone ever been to Downey?
<s> Yeah, she's really somethin'.
<s> I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
<s> I don't know.  Where?
<s> Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
<s> Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
<s> I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
<s> Ed, it was only one review.
<s> You got the job?!!
<s> Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
<s> Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
<s> <u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
<s> Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
<s> Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
<s> Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
<s> I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
<s> Like <u>what</u>?!
<s> That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
<s> That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
<s> Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
<s> But you used to say --
<s> Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
<s> Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
<s> Hruphh...?
<s> Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<s> Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
<s> Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
<s> Don't worry.  We're almost there.
<s> Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
<s> Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
<s> No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
<s> No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
<s> No! I love sex with girls.
<s> Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
<s> Uh, atomic energy?
<s> The poor girl's out of a job.
<s> So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
<s> We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
<s> What octopus motor?
<s> No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
<s> You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
<s> No! Do they show you having sex?
<s> At what point?
<s> Yeah. Ma...
<s> Al!
<s> I'm moving out.
<s> I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
<s> So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
<s> Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
<s> Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
<s> We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
<s> Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
<s> What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
<s> Good luck.
<s> Yes?
<s> No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
<s> Oh.
<s> Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
<s> Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
<s> Oh my God!
<s> Mom?
<s> Oh God. What hospital?
<s> You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> They're gonna mock our foibles.
<s> Never would be plenty.
<s> You batted or you bunted?
<s> I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
<s> Dynamite.
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah.
<s> So?
<s> No. It's your fault.
<s> It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
<s> Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
<s> Screw off.
<s> No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> What's the dif --
<s> It's me, Ed.
<s> It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
<s> Please!
<s> I know.
<s> Ray, come an--
<s> No. Am I supposed to?
<s> It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
<s> The whole time? Eighteen years?
<s> Oh, man! So...
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah. Why?
<s> What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
<s> That's the point -- this could change things.
<s> You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
<s> Dick... Dick,..
<s> Dick.
<s> I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
<s> See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
<s> But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> Thanks, Mr. M.
<s> Ethics are...
<s> You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
<s> You bet.
<s> Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
<s> If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
<s> And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
<s> Looks like today's your lucky day
<s> Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
<s> Yeah.
<s> My house.
<s> Walt needs to see you.
<s> Okay, Jim. I understand.
<s> I did it.
<s> I have proof.
<s> Here?
<s> Should we get a what?
<s> Oh.
<s> Still clear?
<s> Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
<s> Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
<s> A mistake?  That was no mistake.
<s> Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
<s> Okay, let's say
<s> I also like bananas.
<s> Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
<s> Larry, you just take it easy
<s> No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
<s> Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
<s> What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
<s> You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
<s> It's not what you think.
<s> Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
<s> He's waiting for you to mention mention.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
<s> So tell me about it.
<s> Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
<s> What was that boyfriend's name?
<s> Yeah.  A great big one.
<s> It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
<s> It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
<s> The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
<s> The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
<s> They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
<s> At least not anymore.
<s> I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
<s> I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
<s> I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
<s> Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
<s> I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
<s> I got her address.
<s> His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
<s> Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
<s> Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
<s> Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
<s> It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
<s> Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Believed what?
<s> Man, what're you saying?
<s> But you were business associates?
<s> He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
<s> In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
<s> The youngest applicant by eight years.
<s> Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
<s> At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
<s> His blood's always up.
<s> Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
<s> Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
<s> Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
<s> What's this all about, lad?
<s> No.
<s> You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
<s> Give me a minute, will ya?
<s> I want you to follow Bud White.
<s> Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
<s> You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
<s> Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
<s> Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
<s> What?
<s> Bud White's been here?
<s> Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
<s> I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
<s> Some reality.
<s> Right now, before I back down.
<s> Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
<s> When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
<s> No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
<s> Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
<s> What's he doing here, Sid?
<s> Where'd you hear that?
<s> Sid, cut the crap.  I --
<s> Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
<s> So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
<s> Listen to me--
<s> Listen--
<s> Turn on CNN.
<s> Be careful, Danny.
<s> Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
<s> Told by whom?
<s> Who was that other guy?
<s> What do they have to do with this?
<s> You're crazy.
<s> Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
<s> They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
<s> You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
<s> We said a hundred.
<s> One-twenty.
<s> I called my wife!
<s> You told me no calls.
<s> How'd you get around the tap orders?
<s> How'd you have the manpower to--
<s> What's going on?
<s> <u>Here</u>?!
<s> 'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
<s> Why?
<s> They shouldn't have come without calling first.
<s> You sure?
<s> Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
<s> No he won't.
<s> The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
<s> What if we just fucked with 'em?
<s> AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
<s> C'mon.
<s> Is Jerry Delsano in?
<s> The thing is...it really can't wait.
<s> What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
<s> Hello. Hello, Maria.
<s> I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
<s> Is that good?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
<s> <u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
<s> What kind of trouble.
<s> Somebody took my blender.
<s> I saw a man die.
<s> The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
<s> How could you let me find out like this?
<s> Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
<s> Well...yeah.
<s> You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
<s> Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
<s> It's not?
<s> I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
<s> That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
<s> It's how he works.
<s> Eat your fish.
<s> Why?
<s> All right, look--
<s> You have to.
<s> Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
<s> My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
<s> We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
<s> We'd rather not--
<s> My shoe?
<s> Seat 74.
<s> Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
<s> Fuck off.
<s> The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
<s> What are you talking--
<s> Hi, dad.
<s> Really?
<s> Dad!
<s> Where's mom?
<s> Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
<s> Did they take your clothes?
<s> You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
<s> Bobby--
<s> No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Bobby--
<s> Why not?
<s> It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
<s> I said fuck you.
<s> Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
<s> He had help.
<s> We don't know.
<s> What about the tape?
<s> I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
<s> I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
<s> I don't care to bargain.
<s> I do not.
<s> No.
<s> Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
<s> And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
<s> You don't sew at all!
<s> No.
<s> You bastard, I was believing you!
<s> I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
<s> That day, had you followed me to the market?
<s> You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
<s> Yes.  Absolutely.
<s> Could I trouble you for some water?
<s> Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
<s> Her hands and feet were tied.
<s> Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
<s> Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
<s> No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
<s> Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
<s> Okay.
<s> No.
<s> We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
<s> Don't cut me.  Come on.
<s> I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
<s> Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
<s> You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
<s> Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
<s> Moose.
<s> Off with his head!
<s> Darling, for goodness' sake!
<s> Oh no, really.  She has her book.
<s> I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
<s> I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
<s> Yes.  Dropping off.
<s> Are you remembering more?
<s> Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
<s> Why?  Is he staying?
<s> In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
<s> I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
<s> Hey! -
<s> I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
<s> You loved him.
<s> It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
<s> I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
<s> I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
<s> I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
<s> - The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
<s> So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
<s> Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
<s> No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
<s> Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
<s> He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
<s> Exactly.
<s> How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
<s> You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
<s> I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
<s> He's on to something bigger.
<s> I'm going to get him, I promise you.
<s> It's sold.
<s> Then don't.
<s> Uh, yes.
<s> It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
<s> Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
<s> That's my girl.
<s> It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
<s> I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
<s> Can you follow simple directions?
<s> Damn, I knew I forgot something.
<s> Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
<s> I never carry...baggage.
<s> I'm a thief. Sue me.
<s> I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
<s> It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
<s> We go underwater?
<s> You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
<s> We are...for the tools.
<s> A dozen times.
<s> Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
<s> I've got something for you.
<s> Little celebration before we set off.
<s> To our...partnership.
<s> I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
<s> So you had to be your own lifeline.
<s> You're not on the beat.
<s> Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
<s> Ready.
<s> It's your mistake.
<s> Hold the record. Alone.
<s> Everything.
<s> There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
<s> Transfer.
<s> Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
<s> It's no good without the argon gas.
<s> There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
<s> Feeling old?
<s> Surgically attached.
<s> Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
<s> A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
<s> What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
<s> Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> You gave them the eight billion.
<s> You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
<s> Next time I'll use valet parking.
<s> Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
<s> That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
<s> I'm waiting for the tell part.
<s> You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
<s> Yes it does.
<s> Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
<s> Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
<s> Who?
<s> All of 'em?
<s> Which one?
<s> Yes?
<s> You're a lawyer?
<s> Right.
<s> I'll say.  Holy moley.
<s> Wow.  Why would they do that?
<s> Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
<s> If you hadn't used profanity --
<s> <u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
<s> I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
<s> I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
<s> Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
<s> Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
<s> I guess I'm not the right kind.
<s> He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
<s> They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
<s> It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
<s> The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
<s> Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
<s> So you think we got 'em scared?
<s> That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
<s> Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
<s> Erin --
<s> -- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
<s> Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
<s> And that's what caused the contamination?
<s> Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
<s> Really?  It makes me sick.
<s> Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
<s> You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
<s> It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
<s> Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
<s> He's got a reputation for doing all his --
<s> I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
<s> Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
<s> You're not gonna be there.
<s> Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
<s> Corey.
<s> Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
<s> Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
<s> I guess I did.
<s> Nope.  Maiden.
<s> Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
<s> There's more than one kind?
<s> Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
<s> Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
<s> Have you been to the water board?
<s> Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
<s> Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
<s> Well I hate it.
<s> I'm gonna go live with George.
<s> You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
<s> Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
<s> Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
<s> You got more than one?
<s> I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
<s> Better safe than sorry.
<s> Thanks for reminding me.
<s> It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
<s> No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
<s> How would you know?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
<s> I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
<s> Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
<s> Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
<s> Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
<s> Yeah.  Who are you?
<s> Next week.
<s> Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
<s> Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
<s> The Emperor?
<s> We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
<s> Ben ... Ben ...
<s> And that is why I must go.
<s> Barks an argument and shakes his head.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
<s> Howls.
<s> Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
<s> Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
<s> Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
<s> Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
<s> You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
<s> There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
<s> The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
<s> Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
<s> The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
<s> Does Luke know?
<s> To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
<s> I take it back.
<s> Why?
<s> Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
<s> You mean a man you can control.
<s> There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
<s> Here ... near the Anoat system.
<s> I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
<s> That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
<s> Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
<s> No hard feelings?
<s> Repairs ...
<s> I'm sorry too.
<s> Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
<s> Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
<s> You may call me Leia.
<s> Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
<s> I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
<s> ... we're the bait.
<s> I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
<s> There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
<s> You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
<s> Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
<s> Luke needs help.  We must go back.
<s> So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
<s> Well, what now?
<s> What did you say?!
<s> Han's leaving?
<s> I've never seen it fail.
<s> No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
<s> But I feel The Force flowing!
<s> No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
<s> Only what you take with you.
<s> It is the future you see.
<s> Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
<s> I'll die first.
<s> They suggested oranges.
<s> We know that.
<s> My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
<s> But we saw Earth destroyed.
<s> I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
<s> I'm a psychiatrist.
<s> Please
<s> Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
<s> Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
<s> You never heard of Snake Plissken?
<s> You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
<s> Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
<s> Where's Plissken?
<s> Dream on, blue eye.
<s> You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
<s> And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
<s> You don't understand. It's already in you.
<s> So what does this thing do?
<s> Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
<s> Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
<s> Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
<s> Yeah, I got it.
<s> Does he know how to activate it?
<s> Where'd they go?
<s> Delgado?
<s> Right over there.
<s> I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
<s> Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
<s> I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
<s> Which way?
<s> The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
<s> You need help.
<s> I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
<s> I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
<s> You're running out of time.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
<s> ...Perceval!
<s> I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
<s> So be it, to the death.
<s> And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
<s> We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
<s> You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
<s> Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
<s> That's not why you came.
<s> What's this, what's this?!
<s> I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
<s> Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
<s> Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
<s> And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
<s> Ye...
<s> No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
<s> You, my lord.
<s> Because you and the land are one.
<s> I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
<s> There is one.
<s> Love demands it.
<s> We are to blame.
<s> I will run.
<s> Can it truly be used for magic?
<s> I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
<s> One land, one king! That is my peace!
<s> You didn't ask!
<s> Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
<s> Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
<s> And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
<s> You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
<s> Burke.
<s> We have to start looking for a shrink.
<s> Of course I didn't.
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
<s> Why the math?
<s> Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
<s> You're kidding! Like what?
<s> She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
<s> Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
<s> Pretty close.
<s> If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
<s> No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
<s> Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
<s> Why, I don't understand?
<s> Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
<s> Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
<s> What?
<s> Here I'll show you.
<s> I wouldn't talk.
<s> Well I heard differently.
<s> So what's next?
<s> Oh, Christ.
<s> That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
<s> Sure.
<s> Who's in it?
<s> No.
<s> You might loosen the straps then.
<s> That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
<s> It would bring us together.
<s> Uh Huh.
<s> In time.
<s> Uoy era ohw.
<s> But deliver us from the evil one.
<s> The Lord be with you.
<s> Amen
<s> And let my cry come unto thee.
<s> Amen
<s> I've seen him.
<s> Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
<s> Yeah, a fall.
<s> Unlikely.
<s> The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Take it now.
<s> It's all there.  Both nights.
<s> We have some lotion.
<s> You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
<s> Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
<s> Baker.
<s> How many?
<s> Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
<s> How will he eat?
<s> Get your hand off me.
<s> Go fuck yourself.
<s> Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
<s> Recognize these two characters?
<s> I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
<s> How we doing?
<s> Frank.
<s> Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
<s> Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
<s> It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
<s> You got weird kids, Frank.
<s> Trust me, you're not missing anything.
<s> Funny.  Strike a bell?
<s> Says who?
<s> Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
<s> You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
<s> We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
<s> It's early.
<s> I told you I was gonna hit you.
<s> She's here.
<s> Here, how's this?
<s> That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
<s> Yeah, fine.
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah.  You mind?
<s> Right.  I love you, Frank.
<s> I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
<s> I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
<s> Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
<s> Two hours ago!
<s> What the hell are these?
<s> Celebrating.  Join me?
<s> Just until we find another girl.
<s> Twenty-eight years.
<s> Seventy-one
<s> A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
<s> Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
<s> We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
<s> I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
<s> No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
<s> Who's weak now, big brother?
<s> No.
<s> Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
<s> Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
<s> Five years ago.  November.
<s> Spur of the moment.
<s> Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
<s> Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
<s> This is where the auditions were.
<s> Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
<s> Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
<s> That's the premise.
<s> The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
<s> We're a team.  We work together.
<s> Where's my name?
<s> Changed?
<s> Hey!
<s> Nine?
<s> Right.
<s> Maybe.  I'll call him.
<s> So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
<s> Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
<s> First times. Hey, look at this.
<s> Smells like tuna number two to me.
<s> He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
<s> I just saw a man walk out of your room!
<s> Yes, well, they are.
<s> You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
<s> Baker.
<s> Black.  Labrador.
<s> Downstairs.
<s> Not for money. With my mother.
<s> Huh?
<s> I guess in case one year they're not.
<s> Better than that.
<s> Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
<s> Soap?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Oh.
<s> Look, if you want to leave...
<s> So how's the cat food business?
<s> Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
<s> Another five years, huh?
<s> I guess it's getting serious.
<s> Wow.
<s> Sure.
<s> Fine.  You?
<s> He's losing his teeth.
<s> Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
<s> Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
<s> You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
<s> You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
<s> Let me have a look.
<s> It's important.
<s> So you had a nightmare.
<s> And you wouldn't be.
<s> Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
<s> Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
<s> Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
<s> Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
<s> Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
<s> Would it?
<s> She doesn't know -- and she never will.
<s> Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
<s> Not anymore.
<s> Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
<s> You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
<s> Shoot him!
<s> What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
<s> Janie?
<s> I won't tell mom if you don't.
<s> What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
<s> You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
<s> No problem.
<s> A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
<s> Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
<s> What do you know about it?
<s> The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
<s> Gone?
<s> Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
<s> Call me spontaneous.
<s> Great.
<s> That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
<s> Good.  Because I'm fed up.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe...
<s> Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
<s> Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
<s> What about me?
<s> Whats going on here?
<s> But I think I like you better this way...
<s> Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
<s> Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
<s> Check...
<s> Big Eds.
<s> Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
<s> Mary Had A Little Lamb.
<s> Ringing my bell...
<s> I dont think so.
<s> Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
<s> I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
<s> So could you write down her exact address?
<s> Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
<s> Hey, is that really necessary?
<s> Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
<s> Everyone needs something.
<s> Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
<s> You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!
<s> I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
<s> Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
<s> Do I look like I live in a bottle?
<s> Cmon, Jack...
<s> You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.
<s> Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
<s> Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
<s> No, I didnt...thats great.
<s> All in one tape?
<s> Yeah...fine.
<s> Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
<s> Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
<s> Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
<s> Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
<s> I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
<s> No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
<s> Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
<s> I want it...
<s> Its good, right?
<s> Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
<s> What are you sure about?
<s> Think bigger.
<s> No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
<s> No, Jack, I never got married. You?
<s> Jesus, Jack...
<s> You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
<s> That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
<s> Of course I did.
<s> Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
<s> Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
<s> I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
<s> Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
<s> Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
<s> Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
<s> Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
<s> Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
<s> 'Course not.  Strictly business.
<s> Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
<s> They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
<s> Go back to the drawing board.
<s> I'm worried about you.
<s> He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
<s> Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
<s> It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
<s> What do you mean "complete"?
<s> Ben!  Ben!
<s> Oh, it is.
<s> This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
<s> What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
<s> They're not costumes.
<s> So are you!
<s> <u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
<s> Johnny.
<s> You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
<s> That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
<s> At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
<s> Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
<s> <u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
<s> Hilarious.
<s> Ben did this.
<s> What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
<s> Never better.
<s> You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
<s> Passion.
<s> Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
<s> He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
<s> Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
<s> I'm sure I can come up with something.
<s> A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
<s> Victor, are you feeling alright?
<s> I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
<s> Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
<s> For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
<s> Message to Proteus.
<s> They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
<s> If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
<s> The Other Side got to him.
<s> Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
<s> And take a little trip with them...
<s> Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
<s> It's only for an hour --
<s> Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
<s> Yes?
<s> Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
<s> We're pushing oxygen today.
<s> I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
<s> I always thought it was nothing but red.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Not now. We need air, not greetings!
<s> Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
<s> That's what they pay me for.
<s> As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
<s> Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
<s> You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
<s> You left something out.
<s> We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
<s> Then why not take it?
<s> Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
<s> Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
<s> I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
<s> If there's any chance --
<s> It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
<s> There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
<s> Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
<s> His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
<s> Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
<s> Sorry, but the situation has changed.
<s> Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
<s> Go ahead.
<s> They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
<s> Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
<s> We can get out through the Lab Section.
<s> The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
<s> Yes, by all means. We must try it.
<s> Then don't drift down further.
<s> We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
<s> It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
<s> I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
<s> I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
<s> Where's my daughter?
<s> Whoa, Daddy.
<s> Jezhush.
<s> Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
<s> The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
<s> Yah, but this TruCoat -
<s> You have children?
<s> Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
<s> I unnerstand.
<s> Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
<s> Pretty darn good, ya want some?
<s> In what way?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
<s> They're playin' the Buckeyes!
<s> Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
<s> What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
<s> Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
<s> My father-in-law, he's the owner.
<s> I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
<s> Sir? Right now?
<s> Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
<s> No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
<s> Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
<s> Okay.
<s> Jerome Lundegaard?
<s> Whatcha watchin' there?
<s> A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
<s> I know it's a lot.
<s> What's goin' on there?
<s> Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
<s> 2:30.
<s> What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
<s> No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
<s> Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
<s> Well, I don't vouch for him.
<s> I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
<s> Call 'em up.
<s> Oh, yah?
<s> Oh, pretty good.
<s> Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
<s> Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
<s> No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
<s> I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
<s> I always liked ya so much...
<s> Anyone else residing there?
<s> No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
<s> Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
<s> Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
<s> Yah.
<s> - looking.
<s> Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
<s> Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
<s> Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
<s> Love ya, Margie.
<s> Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
<s> Yah.
<s> Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
<s> We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
<s> She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
<s> Well -
<s> Well... Why don't we...
<s> We're still men.
<s> Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
<s> Really, what's that?
<s> Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
<s> "The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
<s> Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
<s> You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
<s> It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
<s> -- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
<s> Really?
<s> Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
<s> You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
<s> Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
<s> The girl had done her homework.
<s> Marla?
<s> Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
<s> This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
<s> So you're staying in tonight?
<s> Please.
<s> Chloe's dead.
<s> ... A person.
<s> Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
<s> Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
<s> Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
<s> Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
<s> I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
<s> You are an insane person.
<s> I'm sorry, but I...
<s> Who's this?
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> ... You know me?
<s> Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
<s> No, supply oxygen?
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> Being clever.
<s> ...no ...no ...
<s> Delivered from Martha Stewart.
<s> Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
<s> The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
<s> I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
<s> Where do you want it?  In the face?
<s> Call what off?
<s> He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
<s> Hum.
<s> Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
<s> I said I promise!
<s> I don't know...
<s> Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
<s> You quit?
<s> Nothing.  Do what you like.
<s> Tell him!
<s> Hey.
<s> Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
<s> If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
<s> What... ?
<s> You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
<s> You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
<s> Um, well... technically, no.
<s> I'm going to...
<s> Stop finishing...
<s> I think this is about where we came in.
<s> Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
<s> It's the only way to get rid of you...
<s> Very good, Sir.
<s> Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
<s> You told me you'd say that.
<s> We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
<s> It's free to all.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Too much school.
<s> I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
<s> Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
<s> I hope you're ready for this.
<s> And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
<s> Speed up.
<s> Carter.
<s> I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
<s> Take my van!
<s> No.  What's this about?
<s> What was the fight about?
<s> Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
<s> Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
<s> How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
<s> I don't...what if I made a mistake?
<s> That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
<s> I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
<s> Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
<s> Right. April 25th.
<s> Don't do it! Don't do it!
<s> That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
<s> I don't.
<s> Why do you think I was hiding?
<s> You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
<s> C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
<s> Huh?
<s> No.
<s> Star Wars?
<s> Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
<s> One hundred.
<s> Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
<s> You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
<s> Where's your stuff?
<s> Exactly.
<s> There are no worse places.
<s> Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
<s> Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
<s> Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
<s> Let me see.
<s> Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
<s> I suppose you have...
<s> It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
<s> Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
<s> Huntington Beach, California.
<s> Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
<s> How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
<s> How?
<s> Let's get that tent down!
<s> I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
<s> Not yet.
<s> That's right.
<s> Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
<s> Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
<s> Have fun.
<s> Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
<s> Can you walk?
<s> I could take it or leave it.
<s> Those men are all dead.
<s> But now it's free, right?
<s> You threw him out?
<s> I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
<s> Meeting ... people.
<s> It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
<s> You still believe in God?
<s> Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
<s> ... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
<s> You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
<s> All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
<s> How have you been?
<s> Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
<s> I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
<s> She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
<s> No...  He is supposed to live there?
<s> Fine.
<s> Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
<s> I was nine in the sixties.
<s> Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
<s> Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
<s> Yes.  They're free.
<s> How much?
<s> I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
<s> I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
<s> Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
<s> What are you doing?  Give that back!
<s> All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
<s> I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
<s> That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
<s> What?
<s> Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
<s> What are the other reasons?
<s> You won't be alone for long.
<s> There isn't any more to tell.
<s> You don't have to say that.
<s> Listen, I'm not feeling well.
<s> Oh... You mean you don't want to.
<s> Shhh...
<s> Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
<s> Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
<s> Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
<s> Well, lemme play the other side then.
<s> Shut up! All of you!
<s> No.
<s> If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
<s> I don't, huh?
<s> I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
<s> Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
<s> How do you know it's clean?
<s> Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
<s> What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
<s> Don't, then.
<s> Who's Van Oost?
<s> Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
<s> Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
<s> Uhm hmm.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, well, he's...
<s> You know, he was formerly a sailor.
<s> Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
<s> I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
<s> What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
<s> I guess you fell in the water.
<s> Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
<s> I gave it a second thought.
<s> Of course I do. It's music. You know...
<s> Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
<s> What?
<s> No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
<s> No, the last time was three years ago.
<s> Thanks, Carl...
<s> Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
<s> Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
<s> No, it's okay.
<s> I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
<s> Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
<s> I hope I didn't hear that.
<s> What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
<s> Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
<s> Well, she was.
<s> Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
<s> Oh, for pity's sake...
<s> God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
<s> Just get the fuck outta here.
<s> Victor.
<s> Hi.
<s> Nothin'.
<s> I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
<s> I can't!
<s> I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
<s> Wussup, Victor.
<s> I got punished, man.
<s> I won't let my motha cut my hair.
<s> C'mon.
<s> Which one?
<s> 'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
<s> You gonna talk to him?
<s> Yeah.
<s> She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
<s> Your friend must be misinformed.
<s> What?
<s> Not really.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
<s> I ought to get some sleep.
<s> I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
<s> You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
<s> Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
<s> I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
<s> Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
<s> Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
<s> Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
<s> That's Babar.
<s> Funny old bird.
<s> Like tonight.
<s> I'm serious, Sam.
<s> Affirmative.
<s> Gum thought Brazil.
<s> Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
<s> That's it?
<s> What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
<s> It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
<s> I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
<s> I'd have been long gone.
<s> The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
<s> Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
<s> Yes. Where you from, Harry?
<s> Oh, about ten days ago.
<s> Since he moved to L.A.
<s> Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
<s> Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
<s> You sure did.
<s> I know.
<s> They bust you every week.
<s> What's that?
<s> I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
<s> Why not?
<s> Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
<s> Who?
<s> I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
<s> Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
<s> Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
<s> I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
<s> In this drawer....
<s> You sure got the hard part.
<s> Can I steal you for a minute?
<s> Deal.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nothing to it.
<s> Cute thing.
<s> I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
<s> Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
<s> Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
<s> I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
<s> You are a rich woman.
<s> I ordered lunch.
<s> No. He was. I got him out.
<s> No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
<s> If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
<s> I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
<s> Don't tell me I can't --
<s> In her cabana, sir.
<s> Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
<s> I recommend it.
<s> No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
<s> Sierra del fuego.
<s> What?
<s> She moved out.
<s> And a damn fine one, I might add.
<s> ...never reads the paper...
<s> He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
<s> Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
<s> Go to transportation, get a ticket.
<s> You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
<s> I want something I can print!
<s> Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
<s> You were going to can me, right?
<s> I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
<s> I said, I ain't got you...
<s> Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
<s> Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
<s> I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
<s> But I am...
<s> Thanks, I needed that.
<s> Right away!
<s> No prob...
<s> Exactly.
<s> Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
<s> Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
<s> Contacts.
<s> What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
<s> Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
<s> How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
<s> People still watch that?
<s> Hah fluck, great video, huh?
<s> Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
<s> There's that question...
<s> Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
<s> Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
<s> Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
<s> Did he just say what I think he said?
<s> You need it.
<s> Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
<s> Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
<s> And hey, I appreciate it...
<s> Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
<s> Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
<s> Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
<s> Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
<s> Fine!
<s> You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
<s> Go on, another time, another place.
<s> Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<s> I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
<s> Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
<s> Ciao.
<s> Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
<s> Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
<s> Julian, you're fired.
<s> That's funny, you're cute.
<s> Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
<s> I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
<s> Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
<s> Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
<s> Yes --
<s> Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
<s> Pour moi?
<s> Mmm.
<s> S'right.
<s> What?
<s> You're for real?
<s> Fake it.
<s> Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
<s> Marseilles.
<s> Willie Mays.
<s> You want some eggs.
<s> A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
<s> Who's on him?
<s> Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
<s> Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
<s> How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
<s> He coulda been white.
<s> Not a chance.
<s> Policy man in Queens.
<s> What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
<s> A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
<s> There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
<s> I can't.
<s> Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
<s> This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
<s> What is that old building?
<s> For garbage?
<s> I been damn careful up to now.
<s> You remember Mary Finelli?
<s> You know what I'm saying.
<s> Well, I think you do.
<s> What I know is what I told you.
<s> Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
<s> No, I think he's up in interrogation.
<s> Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
<s> We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
<s> Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
<s> Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
<s> One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
<s> Wish you weren't.
<s> I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
<s> Do you know where I found this?
<s> Uh, huh.
<s> He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
<s> Frank, please...
<s> Satch, you gotta listen to me...
<s> Next time lets put some money on it.
<s> I know.  Sorry, Dad.
<s> Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
<s> I can't believe people are still using these things.
<s> Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
<s> Huh?
<s> What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
<s> W...B...2...YXB.
<s> I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah...I think so.
<s> Too busy playin' ball, huh?
<s> I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
<s> I'm glad.
<s> What, Johnny?  What is it?
<s> Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
<s> It's Mom.
<s> She's not here.
<s> He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
<s> They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
<s> Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
<s> You really wanna know?
<s> Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
<s> In my pocket.
<s> Okay, okay...
<s> Hang on.
<s> I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
<s> Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
<s> Gordo?
<s> She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
<s> This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
<s> You work too hard, John.
<s> You have the right to speak to an att --
<s> "He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
<s> First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
<s> I'll think of something.
<s> I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
<s> What?
<s> This is all the exercise I need...
<s> Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
<s> You go ahead...
<s> Have you ever made love in a hammock?
<s> Hello.  How are you?
<s> Did you stay here last night?
<s> Are you all right, Shelly?
<s> The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
<s> I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
<s> Why don't you help us?
<s> Yes.
<s> Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
<s> Keep looking.
<s> Just keep your eyes on the road.
<s> Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
<s> Who's Horace?
<s> No way...  ...I wanna rock!
<s> I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
<s> Why?
<s> That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
<s> He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
<s> Uh...yes.  But...
<s> It's just beginning.
<s> Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
<s> Did you hear me?!
<s> No more.
<s> No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
<s> Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
<s> They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
<s> But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
<s> I've seen it.
<s> Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
<s> If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
<s> How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
<s> Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
<s> Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
<s> -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
<s> Twenty.
<s> It's going.
<s> June the 19th.
<s> That's what I'd like to know.
<s> For a good reason.
<s> Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
<s> You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
<s> That's all right.  I was just...
<s> Her name's Stephanie.
<s> Oh my God, Steven.
<s> I'm now begging you.
<s> I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
<s> Okay.
<s> Okay.
<s> He was dead.  He had to be dead...
<s> Until I hear the truth.
<s> That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
<s> No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
<s> The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
<s> Really?
<s> Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
<s> Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
<s> Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
<s> Nothing.
<s> Perfectly.
<s> I packed it. Just for us.
<s> Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
<s> That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
<s> I don't think that's such a safe idea
<s> I'm staying.
<s> I'm staying.
<s> Just felt a little chill.
<s> That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
<s> Yeah...a lot.
<s> What is your location?
<s> The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
<s> Where are they?
<s> Very big.
<s> I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
<s> Press a button and they give us money.
<s> She wants a divorce.
<s> What do I exude?
<s> Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
<s> You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
<s> I say we go.
<s> Do not inhale.
<s> I don't have the problems that artists have.
<s> No, we're not.
<s> We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
<s> `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
<s> Keep going west. Last building before the river.
<s> She was very evasive.
<s> Unbelievable.
<s> Did you see the winning run score?
<s> Let's work on it.
<s> This could be it.
<s> I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
<s> The Red Sox
<s> Why do you need a radio?
<s> You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
<s> Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
<s> I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
<s> Take it yourself. Take a date.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
<s> We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's your best play, Nicky.
<s> All right. What's been going on?
<s> I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
<s> Joanne Bourne.
<s> This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
<s> Life is good.
<s> Washed away.
<s> You're hurting my head.
<s> Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
<s> They're only gonna lose.
<s> But the son is suppose to stop crying.
<s> Since when did that matter?
<s> I can't find it.
<s> It's a simple subject.
<s> Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
<s> I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
<s> Because God loves a winner.
<s> This could be it!
<s> Why does it matter?
<s> Why do you care?
<s> If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
<s> You're out of bullets.
<s> You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
<s> To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
<s> Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
<s> Sidney.
<s> I was educated by nuns.
<s> But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
<s> What color?
<s> That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
<s> I think I remember.
<s> Not one of Steven's finer moments.
<s> A little drastic maybe?
<s> Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
<s> So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
<s> Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
<s> And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
<s> I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
<s> I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
<s> Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
<s> Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
<s> It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
<s> A -- a week.
<s> I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
<s> We must end the campaign.
<s> You will respect the law.
<s> Hm.  Is it?
<s> You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
<s> I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
<s> My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
<s> It's split the Government.
<s> Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
<s> Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
<s> If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
<s> ...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
<s> I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
<s> Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
<s> Er, no...
<s> I like football.
<s> It would be five thousand more.
<s> Not yet, I'm afraid.
<s> I'll see what I can do.
<s> By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
<s> A man's dead, Detective.
<s> No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
<s> --I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
<s> None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
<s> I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
<s> Luca could still be an accomplice.
<s> Where did you get this?
<s> We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
<s> No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
<s> Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
<s> Six one.
<s> You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
<s> They found my eyelash.
<s> In a corridor.
<s> You may as well invite her here.
<s> How would you like to be yourself for the day?
<s> I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
<s> In case you get back before I do.
<s> --We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
<s> They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
<s> I hope he's not just a body.
<s> How tall are you?
<s> I was at home.
<s> You celebrate, Jerome?
<s> You'll be next.
<s> What exactly is wrong?
<s> Of course.
<s> Let's walk.
<s> I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
<s> Only every time I'm in here.
<s> I'll tell you at the end of the week.
<s> New policy.
<s> I'm not doing it.
<s> Not like <i>this</i> one.
<s> I get my own help.
<s> Beynon.
<s> And you got him...
<s> What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
<s> They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
<s> My license expired, let's get out of here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Fatter... some things never change.
<s> But sometimes I cried a lot too.
<s> For exits off Main Street.
<s> If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
<s> At least you were outside.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> I see it...
<s> Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
<s> You sent me to him.
<s> What do we do?
<s> And switched keys.
<s> I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
<s> You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
<s> If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
<s> We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
<s> Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
<s> You and me.
<s> Oh, Jesus... how?
<s> They will have our description before we can get a plane.
<s> Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
<s> Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
<s> We walk.
<s> Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
<s> Thanks. Hope you do too.
<s> Okay. How many bank exits?
<s> Aren't we going a little hard?
<s> Just sandwiches...
<s> Can't leave the desk.
<s> Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
<s> And I keep my mouth shut?
<s> I Just want to find a suitcase.
<s> I'll tell you when.
<s> Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
<s> Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
<s> Was the steering faulty?
<s> What?
<s> You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
<s> You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
<s> That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
<s> I can't.
<s> He was all right to me.
<s> Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
<s> It's the truth.
<s> You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
<s> Nasty.
<s> Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
<s> Brumby.
<s> Sure I'm sure.
<s> I left last year.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Wilton Estate.
<s> That's nice. What'd you tell him?
<s> How many?
<s> Who's Brumby?
<s> I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
<s> Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
<s> I'll bet this one's seen some action.
<s> Funny.  Can I phone London?
<s> No. Really, I am.
<s> Don't ask me.
<s> What about Keith?
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
<s> No. Are you tired?
<s> What, and get myself beaten up again?
<s> A bereavement. A death in the family.
<s> Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
<s> Still got a sense of humour?
<s> Still got your sense of humour.
<s> Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
<s> We've got to take you back to London.
<s> The gun he means.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
<s> To get on the...
<s> And now...
<s> We're stuck with this fucking shit...
<s> I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
<s> Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
<s> Yes.
<s> With River Oaks?
<s> The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
<s> No, it's not that simple, Dave...
<s> You...
<s> What?
<s> What? 
<s> Huh.
<s> Yes.
<s> As a robbery.
<s> No.  Not actually.
<s> You're saying "me."
<s> Is that what I said?
<s> What if you don't get caught?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
<s> I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
<s> Huh?
<s> Down the street.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
<s> Where was I?
<s> I was at home, where were you?
<s> No.
<s> When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
<s> No, who?
<s> No.
<s> Thank you, George.
<s> That they're going to be upset.
<s> Excuse me...
<s> Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
<s> I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
<s> You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
<s> ...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
<s> ...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
<s> ...then...
<s> ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
<s> ...after the thirtieth...
<s> Murray...
<s> Murray said...
<s> The leads are assigned randomly...
<s> ...apart from the top men on the contest board.
<s> What if you don't close...?
<s> Not lately you can't...
<s> Now.  Yes...When?
<s> You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
<s> I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
<s> I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
<s> You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
<s> How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
<s> That was easy, wasn't it?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Because I don't like you.
<s> "...you have to believe in yourself..."
<s> "...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
<s> Last night, this morning.
<s> Mmm.
<s> "You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
<s> From the store.
<s> "What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
<s> I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
<s> Uh...
<s> Kenilworth...?
<s> Mm.
<s> Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
<s> My wife...
<s> It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
<s> That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
<s> Tuesday.
<s> I don't know.
<s> The check wasn't cashed?
<s> I do.  If I don't get my money back...
<s> Fuck the Machine.
<s> Yeah.  He closed a deal.
<s> I'm giving you three leads.  You...
<s> Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
<s> Yes.
<s> At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
<s> Oh yes, the very best.
<s> She couldn't decide.
<s>  He's going to kill Fanucci.
<s> Michael...
<s> I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
<s> I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
<s> I'm not afraid of his words.
<s> Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Mio fratello.
<s> You know otherwise, Freddie?
<s> ...Who?
<s> You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
<s>  And he agreed?
<s> Chi?
<s> With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
<s> Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
<s> I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
<s> I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
<s> Yeah, give me a minute.
<s> Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
<s> No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
<s> Mike wants it.
<s> Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
<s> No questions.
<s> He's going to try Panama...
<s> The room has a bug in it.
<s> Did my brother go back?
<s> He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
<s> That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
<s> You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
<s> Do you owe markers?
<s> Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
<s> I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
<s> Sleeping inside me.
<s> Yes, Michael, it does.
<s> Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
<s> You haven't heard me.
<s> It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
<s> Who's asking?
<s> Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
<s> Yes.
<s> There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
<s> How is his health?
<s> He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
<s> I deny his every charge.
<s> Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
<s> Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
<s> Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
<s> Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
<s> Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
<s> I thought we would meet alone.
<s> You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
<s> You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
<s> We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
<s> My lawyer went over this beforehand.
<s> We got no choice.
<s> That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
<s> I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
<s> It never crossed your mind?
<s> I didn't mean to...
<s> You liked it too.
<s> I'm not a kid.
<s> Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
<s> Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
<s> I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
<s> You will not hurt him?
<s> No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
<s> Expect nothing fancy.
<s> That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
<s> Long enough.  Fifteen years.
<s> Of course.  I am married still.
<s> This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
<s> There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
<s> But I didn't do this!
<s> We have his note.
<s> Nice place.
<s> Boone.  Clayton Boone.
<s> What did she mean by going flooey?
<s> What was wrong?
<s> Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
<s> And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
<s> This David's a friend?
<s> Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
<s> Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
<s> Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
<s> But we have to match the other sketch.
<s> Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
<s> Not at the moment.
<s> Thoreau with a lawnmower.
<s> What happened?
<s> How long were you...?
<s> I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
<s> Not me.
<s> I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
<s> There's no people like you in my crowd.
<s> No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
<s> You asked me to model.  Remember?
<s> I don't hear anything.
<s> David produced her last picture.
<s> Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
<s> That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
<s> Not at all.
<s> I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
<s> What was that?
<s> No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
<s> Ooooh.
<s> Have a drink?
<s> The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
<s> She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
<s> I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
<s> Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
<s> Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
<s> You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
<s> Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
<s> Of course.
<s> Yes?
<s> Luminal.
<s> My mind's lovely.  And yours?
<s> A visitor.
<s> I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
<s> I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
<s> Everything.  Start at the beginning.
<s> Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
<s> What rumors might those be?
<s> You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
<s> I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
<s> Six years ...
<s> What kind of job... ?
<s> And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
<s> I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
<s> I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
<s> No, but you dress like an asshole ...
<s> Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
<s> Point-five ...
<s> Yes ... Kip ...
<s> I don't want him hurt...
<s> Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
<s> "don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
<s> Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
<s> No...
<s> Something like that -
<s> I don't think so, Detective ...
<s> Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
<s> No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
<s> That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
<s> It's all microchips and shit ...
<s> Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
<s> That's a good one, Donny...
<s> We don't -- ?
<s> Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
<s> Mother -- !
<s> Oh, for God's sake
<s> You've been pre-booked...
<s> "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
<s> Don't go there, Toby --
<s> Just hold on... Hold on ...
<s> You, too
<s> Yeah ...
<s> What do you got ... ?
<s> About what?
<s> What?
<s> C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
<s> I can handle it --
<s> Me.
<s> Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
<s> Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
<s> Price of doing business...
<s> I know ...
<s> Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
<s> Thought I'd go for a ride -
<s> Now, we go -
<s> For real?
<s> No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
<s> I understand -
<s> No way ...
<s> Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
<s> Cut 'em...
<s> Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
<s> Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
<s> Hello, Otto ...
<s> He's gotten involved --
<s> The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
<s> His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
<s> Not really -
<s> The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
<s> Billy, how are you?
<s> Me? Why would I get into that shit?
<s> Nods again.
<s> It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
<s> But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
<s> Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
<s> I'm in construction.
<s> What bag?
<s> That again.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I can't do it anymore.
<s> She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
<s> You know. The stuff I left.
<s> Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
<s> I got seared.
<s> Yeah. What about the kids' school?
<s> Paulie was just talking about him.
<s> What?
<s> What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
<s> What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
<s> Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
<s> I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
<s> He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
<s> No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
<s> Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
<s> Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
<s> I don't want them left back.
<s> Please?
<s> Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
<s> --or a tail--
<s> Stop crowdin the plate!
<s> Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
<s> Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
<s> So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
<s> Ah, history I think.
<s> Yeah, it is.
<s> So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
<s> Yah, all right...
<s> So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
<s> The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
<s> I'm Irish.
<s> Why don't you beat off at your house?
<s> Good, it was all right.
<s> It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
<s> It's an integer proof.
<s> Half-red, half-black--
<s> That's fine, but did you ever think--
<s> No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
<s> I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
<s> Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
<s> Yes.
<s> Find out what?
<s> I've been busy.
<s> I got your card.
<s> It's on the college.
<s> We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
<s> Who?
<s> Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
<s> --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
<s> Hold on!
<s> --And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
<s> You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
<s> The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
<s> Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
<s> Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
<s> C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
<s> I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
<s> You've never been out of Boston.
<s> Haven't called her.
<s> You ever think about gettin' remarried?
<s> Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
<s> I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
<s> "I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
<s> I guess.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> Okay, sounds good.
<s> No.
<s> Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
<s> Yes you were.
<s> We'll do that.
<s> Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
<s> No.
<s> Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
<s> Like me?
<s> Come one Will. I just want to know.
<s> I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
<s> --But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
<s> Yeah, but how do you know?
<s> I can't go out to California.
<s> What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
<s> --Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
<s> --some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
<s> What the fuck am I afraid of?!
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
<s> Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
<s> How 'bout you?
<s> Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
<s> Don't hold me so tight.
<s> Well, we ain't out a it yet.
<s> I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Two.
<s> Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
<s> Joad. Tom Joad.
<s> Say, who runs this place?
<s> Why ain't they more like it?
<s> Why, you're the preacher!
<s> Just around that next bend.
<s> I never heard nothin' about it.
<s> I ain't no preacher anymore.
<s> We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
<s> But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
<s> Women is always tar'd.
<s> Want to work, do you?
<s> Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
<s> Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
<s> Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
<s> That's where I get off.
<s> If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
<s> Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
<s> I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
<s> I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
<s> 'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
<s> California.
<s> You mean I can't even get outa here?
<s> This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
<s> Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
<s> Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
<s> They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
<s> I'm ready.
<s> On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
<s> Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
<s> I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
<s> I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
<s> Don't know--but it's better'n this.
<s> Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
<s> You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
<s> How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
<s> Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
<s> But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
<s> But who done it?
<s> Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
<s> But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
<s> Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
<s> I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
<s> I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
<s> Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
<s> Man bones?
<s> Won't they ketch us?
<s> I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
<s> We can pick anything.
<s> Ain't gonna be no trouble.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> Wonderful.
<s> What?
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> Then express yourself, Bob.
<s> A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
<s> Overflowing with love.
<s> You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
<s> It's nice to see you again.
<s> Here is now there. There is here.
<s> Not much else.
<s> Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
<s> Bad people.
<s> --She's not dead---
<s> Jesus Christ!
<s> Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
<s> They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
<s> We're both professionals, Oatman.
<s> Like a club. Work less, make more.
<s> Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
<s> Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
<s> Those all seem kind of related...
<s> I guess.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> --Nooo--
<s> He using her.
<s> Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
<s> All of it?
<s> That's going to cost.
<s> He didn't.
<s> Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
<s> Never enough.
<s> Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
<s> I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
<s> I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
<s> He sold me this bad boy.
<s> To shoot you. Correct.
<s> I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
<s> That's good.
<s> Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
<s> Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
<s> Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
<s> Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
<s> Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
<s> Does Chicago count?
<s> When I was first married.
<s> A jogger, huh?
<s> Need a lift?
<s> You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
<s> Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
<s> Feel good?
<s> She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
<s> Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
<s> Tom.
<s> I won't ask you to.
<s> I don't care! We'd be together.
<s> I can't do this. I can't leave you...
<s> Why?
<s> I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
<s> I brought it to you in the hospital.
<s> Mom?
<s> I don't care.
<s> Why? There's no food in the house?
<s> ... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
<s> Tom?
<s> Well, now you know what it feels like.
<s> FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
<s> Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
<s> What?
<s> Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
<s> Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
<s> Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
<s> Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
<s> Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
<s> That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
<s> She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
<s> No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
<s> Tch. What are you --
<s> No, let me go.
<s> Okay.
<s> Sing it to me, Frankie!
<s> All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
<s> I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
<s> He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
<s> I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
<s> No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
<s> Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
<s> Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
<s> About what?
<s> Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
<s> Take your time.
<s> Oh, I don't know...
<s> Either fight the way things are or accept it.
<s> It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
<s> I was there for that shot, actually.
<s> Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
<s> Promise?
<s> Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
<s> Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
<s> What?
<s> You!
<s> You know, you're a good kid.
<s> Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
<s> Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
<s> Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
<s> There's no hurry. Take you time.
<s> Sure.
<s> I want to watch.
<s> No!
<s> Why don't we just cut through the woods?
<s> We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> NO!
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
<s> How long were you married?
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Honey... I was always good.
<s> Where did you learn all this stuff?
<s> Yeah, cool.
<s> Alright sir.
<s> Waste the dude.
<s> Hackers of the World, Unite!
<s> Dragon book. Compiler design.
<s> The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
<s> Shh!
<s> Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
<s> That's far out!
<s> Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
<s> A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
<s> I'm gonna hit you!
<s> Yeah? Display?
<s> Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
<s> Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
<s> Revenge.
<s> And unpack.
<s> I'm sorry. Who are you?
<s> Nah. I don't play well with others.
<s> Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
<s> This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
<s> How did you know that?
<s> My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
<s> Pool on the roof must have a leak.
<s> You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
<s> If I win, you become my slave.
<s> Make it my first born.
<s> Uh, hold on...
<s> The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
<s> I know, I know who wrote it.
<s> This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
<s> I'll hack the Gibson.
<s> What's happening?
<s> The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
<s> The rabbit is in the administration system.
<s> You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
<s> D'you bring those Crayola books?
<s> Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
<s> Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
<s> Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
<s> All right.
<s> My parents are going to come home early tonight.
<s> No, you don't understand.
<s> Not without Jamie.
<s> I don't know!
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Brady!
<s> Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
<s> Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
<s> You guys always look great.
<s> Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
<s> How many people in the bus?
<s> But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
<s> But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
<s> Coming.
<s> Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
<s> Dad, what's going on?
<s> You knew. You just didn't care.
<s> Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
<s> The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
<s> Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
<s> He's been here.
<s> It isn't a man.
<s> Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
<s> Be here in a minute.
<s> Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
<s> Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
<s> Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
<s> Car trouble?
<s> Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
<s> Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
<s> We just talked.
<s> Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
<s> All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
<s> Fun-ny. See you.
<s> I have a place for that.
<s> I wasn't spooked.
<s> He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
<s> Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
<s> Lee Brackett.
<s> May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
<s> I'll be here.
<s> I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
<s> Have a good time.
<s> Sure.
<s> See you.
<s> After the movie.
<s> We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
<s> Yes.
<s> Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
<s> I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
<s> Oh, listen...
<s> Mmm?
<s> Well, let's hope so.
<s> Oh.
<s> A lot of works.
<s> I mean, I've looked everywhere.
<s> ...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
<s> It depends on what way you want to go.
<s> I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
<s> No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
<s> Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
<s> Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
<s> Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
<s> Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
<s> Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
<s> I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
<s> Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
<s> Hi.
<s> ...ex-husband on the street the other day.
<s> Oh, what, in this section of town?
<s> Oh.  Well, I live--
<s> No, I don't have time.
<s> You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
<s> No?
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
<s> Well, sure.
<s> And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
<s> Oh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes, he's just adorable.
<s> What are you doing?!
<s> I have been in love with you for so long.
<s> What do you expect me to say?
<s> Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
<s> Poor Hannah.
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
<s> Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
<s> Aren't they great?
<s> Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
<s> Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
<s> Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
<s> Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
<s> It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
<s> You're not lost.
<s> It's on the table, Dad.
<s> That thought doesn't terrify you?
<s> Mom, come out!
<s> ...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
<s> Based on what?  You never even see him.
<s> I can't take this anymore.
<s> I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
<s> Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
<s> Who is it?
<s> Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
<s> Hello?
<s> But not you.
<s> Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
<s> I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
<s> No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
<s> I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
<s> Oh, me, I'm okay.
<s> You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
<s> Oh...
<s> Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
<s> I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
<s> I got two minutes.
<s> Here, you guys.  Open them up.
<s> ...you know?  I, uh...
<s> That's a beauty!
<s> I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
<s> You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
<s> ...from Mavis, also.
<s> Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
<s> Oh, yeah. 
<s> Really?
<s> Look, everything's going your way.
<s> Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
<s> I'm real upset about what you wrote.
<s> You're grateful, but you resent me.
<s> No!
<s> Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
<s> Yeah.  Me, too.
<s> Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
<s> ...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
<s> How are you?
<s> I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
<s> What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
<s> Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
<s> Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
<s> Oh, yeah?  What?
<s> I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
<s> Okay.
<s> You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
<s> I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
<s> At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
<s> Oh...
<s> Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
<s> I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
<s> Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
<s> Take our literature...
<s> They're offering... 
<s> Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
<s> Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
<s> I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
<s> I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
<s> And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
<s> Say it in English.
<s> Let's keep it to business, shall we?
<s> Rich, comic book freaks.
<s> Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
<s> Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
<s> COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
<s> And who is "they?"
<s> ...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
<s> Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
<s> Yeah, so where is he?
<s> I won't take much of his time.
<s> Try Barney Clark.
<s> Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
<s> ...young boys, still...?
<s> Mmm...
<s> Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
<s> ....what...? 
<s> Shut up, Starling...
<s> Starling...?
<s> We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
<s> She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
<s> Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
<s> You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
<s> Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
<s> I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
<s> Why did you look at me that way?
<s> Enchante.
<s> She my foster.
<s> No. 
<s> We got KittyKat...
<s> Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
<s> Spoken like a Protestant.
<s> What is that that smells so wonderful.
<s> I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
<s> <u>Yes</u>.
<s> ...what has she done to harm you...?
<s> You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
<s> What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
<s> What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
<s> ...something about my <u>father</u>...?
<s> Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
<s> You goin to shoot yourself? 
<s> ...and that is what you need to expand.
<s> Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
<s> Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
<s> ....because we don't have any mmm...
<s> Oh, my <u>program</u>...
<s> What shape is the scar?
<s> I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.

<s> ...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
<s> And what does <u>that</u> mean?
<s> "A liaison position with the Opera." 
<s> I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
<s> ...yes, yes, yes....
<s> No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
<s> ...no.
<s> What is your point?
<s> ...why?
<s> When?
<s> Because?
<s> And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
<s> Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....

<s> Ronnie!
<s> No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
<s> It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
<s> Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
<s> Something like that. Will you do it?
<s> We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
<s> What are you doing here?!
<s> Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
<s> Very very. The photographs?
<s> Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
<s> Heather.
<s> Yeah, I just got back.
<s> Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
<s> But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
<s> Sure.
<s> If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
<s> No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
<s> Maybe it's time for a vacation.
<s> S'okay....
<s> You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
<s> Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
<s> Chick-en.
<s> Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
<s> Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
<s> That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
<s> Did not.
<s> Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
<s> "You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!

<s> No-o!
<s> I think so, man.

<s> I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
<s> Where is he? Where's J.D.?
<s> Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
<s> Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.

<s> Well, I guess I take after you then!
<s> It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.

<s> Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.

<s> I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
<s> It's so beautiful!
<s> Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
<s> I need my sodding parents' consent.
<s> You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
<s> Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
<s> If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
<s> Just get better okay?
<s> Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
<s> Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
<s> What?
<s> Really? Do tell.
<s> Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
<s> What's that?
<s> Uh... eighty two?
<s> You've been cheating on me haven't you?
<s> Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
<s> Where's my wife?
<s> I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
<s> How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
<s> Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
<s> Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
<s> ... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
<s> Wow you are out of it.  
<s> I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
<s> Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
<s> The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
<s> Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
<s> I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
<s> Right.
<s> Allen?  He... he's okay?
<s> On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
<s> I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
<s> I took a loan on my car and my computer.
<s> I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
<s> I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
<s> You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
<s> Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
<s> Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
<s> What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
<s> Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
<s> You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
<s> I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
<s> All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
<s> You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
<s> Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
<s> I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
<s> Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
<s> A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
<s> He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
<s> What about a reward for coming forward?
<s> She's talking to him now.
<s> Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
<s> You didn't?
<s> We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
<s> You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
<s> Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
<s> Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
<s> Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
<s> No, no, no, no.
<s> Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
<s> Maybe I could take a look at it now.
<s> Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
<s> "Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
<s> 'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
<s> Bye, Neil!
<s> A man scared me.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
<s> He'll never appreciate it more.
<s> Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
<s> Here, take this out to the table.
<s> Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
<s> Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
<s> What?
<s> What's that?
<s> It's a nice pool, isn't it?
<s> Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
<s> Honey, are you okay?
<s> He's made some friends, hasn't he?
<s> Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
<s> Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
<s> Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
<s> Oh, honey.
<s> This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
<s> Shut up.
<s> Do you have enough money?
<s> Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
<s> Promise.
<s> Would you?
<s> Not now.  I'm busy.
<s> What is it?
<s> Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
<s> Lieutenant.
<s> No.
<s> Maybe he was a lousy shot.
<s> Aye.
<s> There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
<s> Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
<s> It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
<s> That is what bothers me.
<s> I'm sure they will.
<s> Living.  Remember?
<s> She's the King's cousin.
<s> It's done.
<s> And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
<s> Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
<s> No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
<s> Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
<s> Who was that man last night?
<s> About what?
<s> You're twenty minutes late.
<s> A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
<s> Conner?
<s> Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
<s> Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
<s> Why?
<s> How could they get by him?
<s> I know, Paul.
<s> It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Me too.
<s> I love you, Conner.
<s> I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
<s> Why?
<s> If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
<s> The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
<s> It's happening right now.
<s> I'm going to my desk.
<s> But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<s> Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
<s> Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
<s> I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
<s> The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
<s> There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
<s> Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
<s> Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
<s> Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
<s> You can't run with suitcases.
<s> They'll cut the power.
<s> Dennis.
<s> I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
<s> You fucked up, Glen.
<s> Where is it?
<s> You sure?
<s> That big asshole nailed my windows.
<s> Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
<s> I know.
<s> What I want is to help my father.
<s> We can't make the microwave work.
<s> Another minute.  Please --
<s> Go, Chief.
<s> Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
<s> Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
<s> I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
<s> What?
<s> They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
<s> Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
<s> Yes.
<s> What do you want?
<s> We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
<s> You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
<s> You want . . . Marlon and Al.
<s> These disks . . . where are they?
<s> Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<s> I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
<s> They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
<s> Cockroaches?
<s> The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
<s> Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
<s> I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
<s> No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
<s> Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
<s> I can't, I don't have the men.
<s> It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
<s> The police are very busy.
<s> I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
<s> I'll be over.
<s> Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
<s> Business is good at the hotel?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
<s> Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
<s> I saw the sign.
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
<s> That will take time.
<s> We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
<s> They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
<s> I need a great favor.
<s> Pack the bags, we have to move.
<s> We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
<s> Of course.
<s> What?
<s> We must do something.
<s> Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
<s> Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
<s> Stay with the children.
<s> He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
<s> No. They are not dead. Stop this.
<s> No, no.
<s> What?
<s> We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
<s> No! Sit down now.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Why?
<s> He has taken the presidential suite.
<s> Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
<s> Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
<s> Yes, thank you Mr. President.
<s> Thank you, Roger.
<s> Please, papa, I have a secret path.
<s> What is his room number?
<s> Go downstairs, I will help you.
<s> -- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
<s> Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
<s> I don't know!!
<s> As a tumor.
<s> I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
<s> A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
<s> -- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
<s> Over here!
<s> And we get this money when?
<s> I thought she was dead. For sure.
<s> Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
<s> An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
<s> Let's try down here...
<s> It'll have to do.
<s> He's gotta still be down here.
<s> We're safe?
<s> Run.
<s> Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
<s> How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
<s> Oh, I think we're going to have several.
<s> Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
<s> Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
<s> -- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
<s> No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
<s> What?
<s> Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
<s> I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
<s> Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
<s> Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
<s> Something with the power, I don't know!!
<s> I never saw you --
<s> Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
<s> -- no more --
<s> "Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
<s> Oh, dear.
<s> Melissa...?
<s> What was her name?
<s> Why don't you pass me your plate?
<s> No!
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> By killing them?
<s> Daddy help!
<s> Well, that all depends.
<s> Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
<s> Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
<s> You didn't think much about that before.
<s> So what are you saying?
<s> You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
<s> She's gone!
<s> Aubrey!
<s> You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
<s> Ok...
<s> Should I...
<s> What?
<s> We're not going.
<s> What's happening!
<s> I'm ok.
<s> We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
<s> And you...are?
<s> Thank you.
<s> The amulet...
<s> Oh.
<s> So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
<s> What?
<s> Jesus Christ ...
<s> Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
<s> I know what I saw.
<s> And what did you discover?
<s> And why are you back?  Why are we here?
<s> Then tell me what to do.
<s> It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
<s> Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
<s> I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
<s> Right.
<s> It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
<s> Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
<s> I'll do it!
<s> No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
<s> Who's that?
<s> Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
<s> No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
<s> No.  We want ...
<s> Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
<s> What else came with it?  Anything still here?
<s> I don't know.  Maybe.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> No.  Really?
<s> Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
<s> Fuck you!
<s> Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
<s> Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
<s> Really?
<s> No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
<s> That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
<s> Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
<s> Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
<s> I laughed, I cried.
<s> It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
<s> Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
<s> Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
<s> I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
<s> There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
<s> "Every day you meet quite a few."
<s> Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
<s> Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
<s> "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
<s> George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
<s> He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
<s> Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
<s> I'll bring my entire repertoire...
<s> Oh, I'm so sorry...
<s> Somebody robbed the Vatican.
<s> Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
<s> Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
<s> Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
<s> Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
<s> Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
<s> Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
<s> That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
<s> You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
<s> I guess that's a no.
<s> What job?
<s> It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
<s> I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
<s> Employer?  The president?
<s> I'm supposed to fall for that?
<s> The Dancing Dingus!
<s> With a little jazz.
<s> Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
<s> He didn't offer you money.
<s> You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
<s> No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
<s> Oh, no, really, I --
<s> Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
<s> Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
<s> ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
<s> Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
<s> Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
<s> Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
<s> I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
<s> I know that, Amy.
<s> You don't say.
<s> What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
<s> That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
<s> Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
<s> We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
<s> Now, Aim --
<s> I don't know...
<s> So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
<s> Forty-eight years...
<s> I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
<s> Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
<s> We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
<s> Nah, that's all forgotten.
<s> But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
<s> Say, that was a swell idea!
<s> Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
<s> '...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
<s> I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
<s> That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
<s> I haven't had --
<s> I --
<s> Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
<s> Sir, my leg is on fire!
<s> Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
<s> She's damn good, Lou.
<s> We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
<s> Where?
<s> So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
<s> I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
<s> I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
<s> I've never heard of a cure.
<s> At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
<s> It's my day off.
<s> Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
<s> I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
<s> You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
<s> I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
<s> I love Fort Holland.
<s> She was beautiful.
<s> No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
<s> I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
<s> I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
<s> I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
<s> But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
<s> Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
<s> To the asylum?
<s> Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
<s> So maybe you'll come too?
<s> So early?
<s> You know Elena, I've been thinking--
<s> Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
<s> You go dry off now.
<s> Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
<s> Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
<s> In the car.
<s> I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
<s> Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
<s> Ben.
<s> Paul? Yeah. You think --
<s> Fine.
<s> Ben--
<s> Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
<s> Jesus all right enough!
<s> What do you think we're doing, dad?
<s> I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
<s> Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
<s> -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
<s> Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
<s> Let me.
<s> Hi Wendy.
<s> Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
<s> Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
<s> Yes.
<s> They say you never forget.
<s> I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
<s> I gotta get to English class.
<s> Do what?
<s> My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
<s> Major.
<s> Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
<s> Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
<s> Let's see!
<s> Hey, it's a sellable skill.
<s> What is it?
<s> Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
<s> Who said so?
<s> I don't have a girlfriend.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Sure, anything but this English.
<s> I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
<s> Out.
<s> Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
<s> Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
<s> Communist Viet Cong.
<s> One more shot?
<s> Too bad...
<s> But there wasn't any...
<s> Yeah.  All over.
<s> Twelve years younger.
<s> Okay.
<s> About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
<s> Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
<s> I know.
<s> Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
<s> We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
<s> Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
<s> What time was that?
<s> Has her books in it.
<s> I told her to come.
<s> Seven years.
<s> When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
<s> Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
<s> Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
<s> Will?
<s> What is it?
<s> Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
<s> Best friend?
<s> That's what I said.
<s> Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
<s> But she was an attractive girl.
<s> Did you have sex with her?
<s> He.  Well, he...
<s> It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
<s> Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
<s> They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
<s> Nothing if not vampires...
<s> Surely you know the one who made you...
<s> Your lover.
<s> If you say so. You are innocent.
<s> Follow me - that way - through my cell -
<s> Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
<s> Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
<s> Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
<s> I didn't realise.
<s> Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
<s> I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
<s> You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
<s> I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
<s> He jests.
<s> And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
<s> And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
<s> I took your life. He gave you another one.
<s> Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
<s> I can't. Go away from me.
<s> And you never cried -
<s> Still my beautiful child.
<s> They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
<s> What danger?
<s> Never.
<s> So you felt it too!
<s> Yes...
<s> And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
<s> Give it to me!!!
<s> How do you mean, start?
<s> You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
<s> I can't go through with it, I tell you.
<s> But why do you want me?
<s> Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
<s> Dying?
<s> The crucifix -
<s> You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
<s> And if I don't?
<s> But how do you know?
<s> I can't.
<s> Paris? You came from Paris?
<s> I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
<s> You finish her - if you feel so much -
<s> NO!!!
<s> I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
<s> Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
<s> The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
<s> You're not lying to me, are you?
<s> Oh, that rumour about crosses?
<s> He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
<s> It's over, I'm telling you...
<s> If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
<s> Checking in...Karla Wilson.
<s> Is that bad?
<s> July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
<s> That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
<s> Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
<s> Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
<s> Karla! You promised.
<s> Yes.
<s> The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
<s> Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
<s> Just kidding.
<s> Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
<s> Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
<s> I've got to see.
<s> Come on, you can make it.
<s> Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Will you try...for me, please?
<s> Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
<s> You know me to well.
<s> Who?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
<s> To get out of Southport?
<s> I'm okay.
<s> Did you get help?
<s> Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
<s> Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
<s> Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
<s> Hey --
<s> I don't know, but I'm starving.
<s> How much?
<s> No. I shot him.
<s> The rest of us see bathrobes.
<s> You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
<s> This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
<s> Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
<s> They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
<s> They were gore before I came here.
<s> How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
<s> I think not.
<s> I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
<s> Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
<s> Poor Cathy --
<s> Thea is an orphan.
<s> What an odd question!
<s> I do not know him, but I have seen him.
<s> But one must love a father.
<s> How do you know what my father thought - -
<s> This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
<s> I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
<s> If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
<s> Her name is Thea?
<s> She's not too well.
<s> Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
<s> It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
<s> Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
<s> But the war, the army  they need you.
<s> We still don't know that it's the plague 
<s> Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
<s> The General threatened me.
<s> Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
<s> Then foreclose!
<s> Who?
<s> All right  all right.
<s> Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
<s> Don't . . . George?
<s> What did . . .
<s> Merry Christmas.
<s> Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
<s> Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
<s> I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
<s> Our clothes are dry.
<s> Made what?
<s> Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
<s> Oh, well, I can't . . .
<s> Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
<s> That's your problem, George Bailey.
<s> George Bailey.
<s> That's the kid.
<s> Well, wait and see.
<s> No!
<s> Yes, but George . . .
<s> I know. I know.
<s> Hiya, George!
<s> Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
<s> Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
<s> That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
<s> Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
<s> Oh . . .
<s> I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
<s> I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
<s> Oh, stop that grunting.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> Okay.  What's yours?
<s> Look, Nick. What's wrong?
<s> I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
<s> Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
<s> Maybe you were born older, George.
<s> You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
<s> Come on, George, let's hurry.
<s> Hello, Violet.
<s> Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
<s> Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
<s> It's important.
<s> How do you do.
<s> I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
<s> I'd like to do that.
<s> All right, sir.
<s> Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
<s> I don't like coconuts.
<s> I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
<s> Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
<s> You may kiss my hand.
<s> Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
<s> I'm going to scream!
<s> About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
<s> Tuesday.
<s> Do you like it?
<s> Well, then, sit down.
<s> Don't you like her?
<s> Thanks for dropping around.
<s> Hi.
<s> Going up to see Zuzu.
<s> I don't care. It's George's tux.
<s> Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
<s> Huh?
<s> What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
<s> Too hot in the lighthouse?
<s> Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
<s> The Shark.
<s> What the hell, we're steering for it.
<s> Anyone got another set of sails?
<s> The rope!  The rope!
<s> Can you get us a line?
<s> N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
<s> It's still there!
<s> In here.
<s> Not the drugstore!
<s> You can't stop me.
<s> Hey -- you can't do that.
<s> Never mind that shit.  Just point.
<s> You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
<s> What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
<s> Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> I kind of had plans....
<s> Hey, come on....
<s> At least you're safe.  What about the others?
<s> Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
<s> Me neither.
<s> All of us thank you, okay?
<s> Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
<s> Is that what it is?
<s> We don't know that, do we?
<s> I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
<s> Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
<s> Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
<s> Late.
<s> Mrs. Silvera.
<s> For me?
<s> Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
<s> Are you going to be able to sleep?
<s> That's great too.  Gorgeous.
<s> Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
<s> Just one minute....
<s> Mike's out there.
<s> Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
<s> I know, I know....
<s> Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
<s> Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
<s> 10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
<s> That's what he said.
<s> No.  Find your brother, okay?
<s> Hiya yourself.
<s> Dad!  Dad!
<s> That's you.
<s> Great.
<s> You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
<s> Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
<s> They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
<s> And second?
<s> Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
<s> Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
<s> I'll be right there.  Wait up.
<s> I'm not sure I can.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> Would you take him?
<s> How the hell do we get him down. from there?
<s> No, I'm fine, thanks.
<s> No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
<s> I can get it.
<s> With those camera lights and...
<s> You buying?
<s> How many sharks have you killed?
<s> They're acting very strange suddenly.
<s> Don't forget you have your brother.
<s> Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
<s> I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
<s> ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
<s> I know I can capture it.
<s> What's that?
<s> No, you're not.
<s> How's your patient?
<s> You don't.
<s> No,  I'm not going through there.
<s> I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
<s> ... He ought to put him in here.
<s> Hydrophobia...
<s> I can't take water, Kathryn.
<s> I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
<s> This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
<s> Who's going to do it?
<s> I want that shark, Kathryn.
<s> I'm  fine.
<s> Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
<s> No!
<s> Well, then I'm going to film it.
<s> Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
<s> Still sleeping.
<s> Thanks for helping.
<s> Somebody could have gotten hurt.
<s> Someone's looking for you.
<s> How you doing, Kelly?
<s> Massachussettans aren't.
<s> ... Massachussettans aren't.
<s> That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
<s> Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
<s> It's okay, Sean.
<s> Hold still, damn it!
<s> Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
<s> I'll remember that, my Lordship.
<s> I know.  But we show it's not closing.
<s> Got a job for me?
<s> Sharks???
<s> I wouldn't mind going down with her.
<s> Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
<s> Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
<s> We need milk....
<s> My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
<s> I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
<s> They're at the beach....
<s> What's wrong?  What happened?
<s> But it went away...We would have known....
<s> I'm not on vacation....
<s> You caught me....
<s> Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
<s> I'm hungry, Mom....
<s> Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
<s> A small one...Your brother won't be here....
<s> Where's the lady who brings the soda?
<s> I'm still five....
<s> I didn't.
<s> Good night, Daddy....
<s> You guys must be starving....
<s> It picked Sean...It killed your father....
<s> I'm fine....
<s> I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
<s> I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
<s> I have to get this finished.
<s> I don't want to talk about that.
<s> No.
<s> Why'd you come out here?
<s> There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
<s> Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
<s> I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
<s> Sure you can....
<s> If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
<s> Nothing....
<s> You're not going to bet it all....
<s> No!
<s> You're always taking time off....
<s> Why?
<s> We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
<s> Good news travels fast....
<s> What's that....?
<s> Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
<s> Oh, boy....
<s> The females have eggs....
<s> Don't say anything about this to my mother....
<s> Gave them the day off....
<s> My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
<s> So did I....
<s> So far..
<s> As long as he's been here....
<s> How long has he been here...?
<s> What do you know about him?
<s> Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
<s> I live to hear the sound...You all right?
<s> 'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
<s> 'Snuck up on me....'
<s> You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
<s> My equipment doesn't crap out....
<s> No way....
<s> I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
<s> We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
<s> Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
<s> "Welcome to Eureka."
<s> Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
<s> The <u>dogs</u>?
<s> What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
<s> Since when did you drink diet soda?
<s> Not too good in daylight ..
<s> Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
<s> A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
<s> <u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
<s> Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
<s> How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
<s> Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
<s> For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
<s> He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
<s> I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
<s> I'm asking it.
<s> <u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
<s> This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
<s> Bits.
<s> That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
<s> No, Sir.
<s> It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
<s> That's bullshit,
<s> I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
<s> Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
<s> I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
<s> Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
<s> As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
<s> I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
<s> No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
<s> Hamlet. Have you read it?
<s> You should. It's wonderful.
<s> There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
<s> How d'you know what I'm like?
<s> Which is what?
<s> Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
<s> It's not possible right now.
<s> Why does he want to kill me?
<s> I can't identify him ..
<s> I know about alcohol, John.
<s> Grateful for your candor, Sir.
<s> Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
<s> Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
<s> You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
<s> Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
<s> No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
<s> His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
<s> Ask him.
<s> One of the accountants.
<s> Ugh!
<s> That's right.
<s> Okay, this is working.
<s> Jerry!  Do something --
<s> What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
<s> "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
<s> Oh come on --
<s> They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
<s> Hello?
<s> He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
<s> And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
<s> And I am...
<s> Mission... statement...
<s> Plus, you could use that commission.
<s> Bye you guys. _ 88.
<s> This rig? Phht.  No problem.
<s> Well, when you wonder, ask me.
<s> ...my soul or something. _ 117.
<s> Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
<s> Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
<s> So this break... is a break-up.
<s> Of course, medical! _ 42.
<s> Of course I know --
<s> I'll give it everything.
<s> Said who?  Sugar?
<s> We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
<s> Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
<s> Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
<s> You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
<s> Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
<s> Another drink please.
<s> But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
<s> Great word.  Towel?
<s> You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
<s> Oh, we gonna be friends now?
<s> Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
<s> No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
<s> Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
<s> Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
<s> I missed ya.  What can I say?
<s> What --
<s> And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
<s> I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
<s> I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
<s> Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
<s> A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
<s> We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
<s> So do you.
<s> Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I filmed this the morning they left.
<s> Eric!
<s> We have to help him.
<s> Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
<s> You couldn't have made that jump.
<s> You mean it?
<s> How low?
<s> I thought you were an expert.
<s> Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
<s> Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
<s> He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
<s> Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
<s> You think they could talk to each other?
<s> In Costa Rica?
<s> You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
<s> Which one do you prefer?
<s> Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
<s> The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
<s> Something must've scared them.
<s> I have never been on this island!
<s> But you never came across just one.
<s> Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
<s> You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
<s> Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
<s> After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
<s> Everyone, keep your voices down!
<s> I want to see the nesting ground!
<s> I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
<s> That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
<s> Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
<s> This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
<s> I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
<s> Possible.
<s> She's nuts.
<s> No.
<s> Where's Kelly?
<s> What's that?
<s> It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-

<s> Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
<s> Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
<s> Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
<s> How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
<s> Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
<s> Thank you.  I have no further questions.
<s> Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> How many lovers have you had-- permanently?

<s> We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
<s> Yes.

<s> Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
<s> He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
<s> Kramer...
<s> Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
<s> I'm going to take it.
<s> Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
<s> You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...

<s> Any prospects?
<s> No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.

<s> Thank you. Please sit.
<s> I have.
<s> Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
<s> Yes, but they say he did.
<s> Then, we shall meet.
<s> Far, far away.
<s> How many?
<s> We do not know.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Roughly five thousand men.
<s> No. This war is almost over.
<s> So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
<s> I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
<s> Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
<s> Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
<s> The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
<s> I will not go.
<s> True.
<s> Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
<s> You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
<s> You cannot.
<s> I would not know. Maybe.
<s> No, Holiness.
<s> We have.
<s> And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
<s> We cannot.
<s> Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
<s> What would you do, Holiness?
<s> It is a difficult situation.
<s> Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Thank you.
<s> It happens when I land.
<s> <u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
<s> They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
<s> Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
<s> What the hell are you doing?!!
<s> He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
<s> I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
<s> I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
<s> Get the gun.
<s> I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
<s> Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
<s> Right.
<s> You do?
<s> You talk to Bickerman?
<s> Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
<s> I never had sex with you!
<s> Nothing's real.
<s> We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
<s> Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
<s> I <u>told</u> you.
<s> Good.
<s> In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
<s> Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
<s> Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
<s> Ssssh!
<s> <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
<s> You calm down!
<s> Well...
<s> Likewise.
<s> Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
<s> Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
<s> Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
<s> Other than to eat us?
<s> I'll take it!
<s> You too.
<s> <u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
<s> Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
<s> They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
<s> Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
<s> I asked you to be nice to him.
<s> You like Jack?
<s> Hector thinks you like him.
<s> I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
<s> He said he knew Karate!
<s> I don't know.  Back the truck--
<s> I guess.
<s> A tooth?
<s> I <u>tapped</u> you.
<s> Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
<s> It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
<s> Kelly--
<s> Backstabber?
<s> Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
<s> The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
<s> Sometimes.
<s> I don't know! Get me out!!
<s> How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
<s> Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
<s> Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
<s> I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
<s> Okay, Mr. Yow...
<s> I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
<s> There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
<s> Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
<s> You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
<s> He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
<s> I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
<s> Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
<s> He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
<s> We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
<s> Yes.
<s> Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
<s> Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
<s> Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
<s> No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
<s> Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
<s> I never thought about it.
<s> Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
<s> That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
<s> How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
<s> No! That's incidental.
<s> Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
<s> Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
<s> I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
<s> But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
<s> Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
<s> Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
<s> Sorry to disappoint you...
<s> Miss.  May I?
<s> I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
<s> Alice?
<s> Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
<s> There was none!
<s> Yes. Yes, I will.
<s> Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
<s> He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
<s> No.
<s> No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
<s> Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
<s> We don't.
<s> Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
<s> : Only one or two loads.
<s> I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
<s> You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
<s> Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
<s> That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
<s> That's all, sir.
<s> What did you see, Major?
<s> Webb's at Edward?
<s> And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
<s> Fire!!!
<s> Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
<s> Yes sir!
<s> Wampum?
<s> How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
<s> Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
<s> Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.

<s> Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
<s> I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
<s> Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
<s> About twenty minutes.
<s> You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
<s> That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
<s> This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
<s> Just give me the keys.
<s> All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
<s> Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
<s> Hit the fuckers.
<s> Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
<s> It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.

<s> Of course you are. All right, Ed.
<s> You know it doesn't include the amp.
<s> Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
<s> I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
<s> At what, exactly?
<s> So?
<s> Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
<s> Get your fingers out of my soup!

<s> Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
<s> --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
<s> What?
<s> I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
<s> He a Black man or an Indian?
<s> They fought against the Indians?
<s> I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
<s> You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
<s> Made some money, came back here--
<s> Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
<s> I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
<s> What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
<s> Good deal you were born down here, then.
<s> Have we had trouble there before?
<s> The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
<s> You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
<s> Aqui! [Here!]
<s> Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
<s> I have some friends who have had a accident--
<s> Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
<s> King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
<s> That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
<s> --but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
<s> We don't need a new jail.
<s> Do you?
<s> I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
<s> People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
<s> Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
<s> I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
<s> Well, you hire illegals--
<s> No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
<s> A little older than Paloma is now.
<s> I was too busy.
<s> I don't mean Fernando.
<s> I never said that.
<s> I never said that. It was just that boy--
<s> I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
<s> Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
<s> Of course you can.
<s> It's Saturday.
<s> Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
<s> Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
<s> I thought he busted you a couple times.
<s> Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
<s> He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
<s> Are you okay?
<s> They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
<s> He hates me.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
<s> Pilar--
<s> Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
<s> Yeah--
<s> Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
<s> Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
<s> I been working on a few things.
<s> Sure.
<s> No--
<s> Another woman?
<s> You know who it was?
<s> You going to tell him?
<s> You believe that?
<s> Thirty-five bucks.
<s> They go together.
<s> My life was too weird for her.
<s> That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
<s> doorway) And who's that?
<s> I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
<s> Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
<s> That's so cool.
<s> Deep shit?
<s> All right.  It was...
<s> He won't.
<s> You'll do more.than that.
<s> Not yet.
<s> What is he?
<s> Yes.
<s> Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
<s> You don't?
<s> Does that mean...?
<s> But obviously you still care what happens to him.
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't know where you'd start.
<s> Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
<s> I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
<s> You didn't marry him for love.
<s> Why don't you tell me the truth?
<s> It was more than that, I think.
<s> I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
<s> Nothing?
<s> I'm here, Harry.
<s> Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
<s> Somebody killed him.
<s> I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
<s> --vanished.
<s> So could you walk on water?
<s> Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Maybe I just bought it.
<s> You know of him?
<s> I don't think the dead much care.
<s> What for?  You need to stay busy?
<s> Yes.
<s> Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
<s> Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
<s> What about?
<s> Not much.
<s> Now I'm going to have to kill you.
<s> Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
<s> I did it for Dorothea.
<s> Will that do?  No?
<s> And you're not?
<s> And you believed him?
<s> Looks that way.
<s> You didn't try hard enough.
<s> I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
<s> No!
<s> Why would I want to?
<s> Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
<s> So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
<s> You'll do it?
<s> I know, it's stupid.
<s> Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
<s> OK, see you downstairs.
<s> I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
<s> You're possessive.
<s> That's ok.
<s> But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
<s> Where'd you grow up?
<s> How old is she?
<s> Oh, she'll love it.
<s> I don't want to be.
<s> You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
<s> Thanks.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
<s> It's Lydia, your wife.
<s> Thank you, Mr. Harris.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Sure.
<s> That's ok, you'll figure it out.
<s> I gotta go to work.
<s> We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
<s> Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
<s> I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
<s> Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
<s> No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
<s> What happened?
<s> No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
<s> Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
<s> And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
<s> Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
<s> Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
<s> Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
<s> Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
<s> You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
<s> I hope so.
<s> Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
<s> I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
<s> You ready?
<s> Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
<s> Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
<s> Father, I'm right here.
<s> Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
<s> I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
<s> Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
<s> And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
<s> I think you gave me the wrong one.
<s> I had to.
<s> Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
<s> I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
<s> What?
<s> What are these?
<s> Whish the circumstances were different.
<s> I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
<s> It's Detective Smythe.
<s> Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
<s> Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
<s> I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
<s> To that stewardess?
<s> You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
<s> What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
<s> Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
<s> She's alright.
<s> The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
<s> This time get your feet set.
<s> I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
<s> It's okay.
<s> Four days.
<s> You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
<s> Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
<s> Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
<s> Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
<s> Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
<s> What?
<s> Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
<s> Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
<s> But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
<s> I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
<s> I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
<s> Guess "please" would be a stretch.
<s> Who said I'm not getting recruited?
<s> Yeah.
<s> He ain't Spalding.
<s> So you took Shawnee, huh?
<s> That what you think?
<s> Plan to.
<s> What's up?
<s> Nobody.
<s> Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
<s> Hey, what's up.
<s> The "man" again.
<s> What the hell's going on?
<s> I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Look, I'm entering the draft.
<s> I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
<s> Few days ago.
<s> I'm alright.  But you can sit.
<s> Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
<s> Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
<s> Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
<s> So you're gonna bitch up?
<s> So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
<s> C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
<s> What's that, not great?
<s> Nona, please.
<s> Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
<s> Yup.
<s> Said he'd be home later.
<s> So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
<s> You know, people.
<s> I'm also good enough to go pro.
<s> We need to talk.
<s> Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
<s> Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
<s> It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
<s> I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
<s> It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
<s> I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
<s> YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
<s> GET OUT.
<s> -- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
<s> You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
<s> Who was it?
<s> It's fine.
<s> -- do you wanna cup?
<s> I don't have a boyfriend.
<s> yeah, good, ok.
<s> Good bye.
<s> Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
<s> Well I don't go out very much.
<s> Let's make a deal.
<s> I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
<s> yeah, yes, hi, hello.
<s> They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
<s> I don't know.
<s> Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
<s> No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
<s> We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
<s> No Can Do.
<s> No.
<s> I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
<s> C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
<s> -- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
<s> Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
<s> What's up?
<s> Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
<s> Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
<s> This sounds threatening.
<s> Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
<s> Might of been before my time.
<s> I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
<s> -- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
<s> "Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
<s> Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
<s> Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
<s> PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
<s> Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
<s> I'm trying.
<s> She loves you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> There's no asshole like you.
<s> How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
<s> Is Jack your son?
<s> I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
<s> Is this 509-9027?
<s> Like I said, yeah --
<s> -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
<s> I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
<s> My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
<s> He passed away.
<s> Right.
<s> What name?  My name?
<s> My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
<s> "Frank" was my mother's father.
<s> Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
<s> ...are you Phil...?
<s> Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
<s> I'm really sorry.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Uh. huh.
<s> You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
<s> No one else in here?
<s> I'm not askin', Marcie.
<s> It's ten o'clock in the morning --
<s> I didn't hear anything.
<s> I don't have to do a god damn thing.
<s> THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
<s> Fuck no.
<s> Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
<s> I need you to get me Paula --
<s> I'm drinking.
<s> I'm a bad person.
<s> Will that help?
<s> Yes.
<s> How long with Paula?
<s> Is it over 'cause you're sick?
<s> Do you feel better now that you've said this?
<s> Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
<s> Maybe...I don't...
<s> Hello.  Is Claudia here?
<s> Are you her boyfriend?
<s> Yes.  What's your name?
<s> I'm her father.
<s> I'II go....is it...back here?
<s> What's MOW?
<s> Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
<s> You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
<s> I'm trying to help, Linda --
<s> PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
<s> Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
<s> Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
<s> That's it.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Go to bed.
<s> It's ok.
<s> It's raining frogs from the sky.
<s> I understand you saved my son's life today.
<s> That is good.
<s> If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
<s> Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
<s> May I speak with you?  Alone?
<s> Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
<s> I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
<s> Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
<s> Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
<s> Replace the king.
<s> Making the key to the throne.
<s> In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
<s> He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
<s> Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
<s> It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
<s> We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
<s> Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
<s> I know.  God go with you.
<s> Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
<s> Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
<s> Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
<s> Come on...
<s> At a ball, everyone watches the King!
<s> None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
<s> Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
<s> She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
<s> I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
<s> You trust his character more than anyone else does.
<s> The King killed my son!
<s> I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
<s> I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
<s> There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
<s> What is its antidote?
<s> It is something I have done -- or did not do.
<s> No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
<s> She will be at the ball.
<s> Who came?
<s> I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
<s> Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
<s> ... You knew you had a double?
<s> Forgive?!
<s> Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
<s> ... Two-thirty-seven.
<s> What was the end page?
<s> Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
<s> Shoot them!  Shoot them!
<s> Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
<s> That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
<s> Sire, I --
<s> A letter.  May I see?
<s> Oh Louis, Louis...
<s> Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
<s> We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
<s> If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
<s> Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
<s> So what?
<s> we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
<s> It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
<s> Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
<s> Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
<s> What?
<s> Gotta come from somewhere...
<s> I didn't break in - the back door was open!
<s> I'll live...
<s> It wasn't in the cards.
<s> And what did he do to the girl?
<s> That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
<s> You'll find out - soon enough.
<s> What did you do then?
<s> What happened with the tape?
<s> Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
<s> Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
<s> It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
<s> I killed them.
<s> Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
<s> OK...where do you want to start?
<s> No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
<s> What else is new?
<s> I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
<s> Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
<s> Screw him!
<s> Not with this...
<s> Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
<s> Book code?
<s> You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
<s> I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
<s> He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
<s> The mark? Yes.
<s> You.
<s> We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
<s> It's your call, Will. What do we do?
<s> Wait, Will...
<s> What's it narrow down to?
<s> When I'm done.
<s> 'Changes?'
<s> Don't talk to me!!
<s> Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
<s> Tonic will be fine.
<s> Yes, are you okay...?!
<s> I have work to do at the plant.
<s> No!
<s> Was I in an accident?
<s> My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
<s> Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, God.
<s> Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
<s> I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
<s> Why do you think I called?
<s> Most people are.
<s> That's true.
<s> Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> We have it good, don't we?
<s> Hey, baby! Where are you?
<s> Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
<s> You haven't smoked in two years.
<s> I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
<s> I have to go back to Birmingham.
<s> Will...
<s> Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
<s> Go on to the house.
<s> Yeah...
<s> In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
<s> I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
<s> No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
<s> Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
<s> ...after a while.
<s> I keep getting it for Christmas.
<s> No.
<s> Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
<s> I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
<s> Yes.
<s> Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
<s> Yes. I'd considered it.
<s> I want your opinion.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Fight what?
<s> It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
<s> Pretty well.
<s> It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.

<s> George, I hate sitcoms.
<s> What's up?
<s> Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
<s> Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
<s> No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
<s> It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.

<s> So who's gonna pay for it?
<s> You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
<s> You've got good days and bad days.
<s> You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
<s> No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
<s> Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
<s> Deal.
<s> Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
<s> Hi... am I late?
<s> Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
<s> If you want...
<s> No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
<s> I can shtop whenever I want...
<s> I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
<s> You don't know the real me.
<s> Okay.  You're probably right.
<s> Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
<s> I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
<s> Then your father's a wimp.
<s> No!  Andy, don't do it --
<s> The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
<s> Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
<s> But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
<s> Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
<s> I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
<s> Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
<s> Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
<s> FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
<s> They're gonna lynch him!
<s> Why isn't he MOVING??
<s> It's already begun.
<s> We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
<s> And you are?
<s> No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
<s> What?
<s> Should Tank I.D. it?
<s> Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
<s> Cypher?  Where's Tank?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> How many were there?
<s> They'll be able to track it.
<s> He's beginning to believe.
<s> Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
<s> Stand up and see for yourself.
<s> I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
<s> There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
<s> There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
<s> You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
<s> Far from it.
<s> More important than what is when?
<s> You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
<s> What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
<s> I think I do.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That I would find the One.
<s> Why?
<s> He is the One.  He is the One!
<s> I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
<s> How did you know...?
<s> It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
<s> It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> She told me...
<s> A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
<s> We can't leave him!
<s> Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
<s> No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
<s> Yeah?
<s> If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
<s> I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
<s> Because I believe in something.
<s> Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
<s> Look fella...this is private...
<s> Ok.  Wait here.
<s> 'And with your spirit.'
<s> 'Thou art then a king?'
<s> And say what?
<s> Thanks for the ride.
<s> All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
<s> Should I slap him?
<s> Wouldn't bother me.
<s> Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
<s> That's not going to help.
<s> Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
<s> Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
<s> What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
<s> Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
<s> No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
<s> What pipes?
<s> My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
<s> Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
<s> Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
<s> Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
<s> Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
<s> Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
<s> No you weren't.
<s> Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
<s> You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
<s> What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
<s> All right.
<s> Wha?
<s> Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
<s> Here.
<s> What is it now?
<s> Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
<s> The girls like it loud.
<s> I know...I know.
<s> Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
<s> Sure.
<s> Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
<s> He's cute.
<s> We've got some things to discuss.
<s> It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
<s> That you've been to Susan?
<s> Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
<s> Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
<s> Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
<s> Hi.
<s> That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
<s> Hello, Quince.
<s> Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
<s> Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
<s> What an odd pairing.
<s> Of whom?
<s> But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
<s> Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
<s> No no, not you.
<s> Me, too.
<s> Like a marriage made in heaven?
<s> 'Just kidding'?
<s> As much as Joe's?
<s> For how long?  And why?
<s> Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
<s> If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
<s> Yours.
<s> Bontecou wants a quick response and --
<s> Don't you want to hear the details?
<s> So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
<s> I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
<s> Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
<s> Make it go 'way.
<s> Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
<s> What?
<s> You're welcome.
<s> 'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
<s> What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
<s> You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
<s> I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
<s> I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
<s> How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
<s> I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
<s> Patients have visitors, not doctors.
<s> I don't know.
<s> To bed.
<s> I said get out.
<s> Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
<s> I am.
<s> It gets worse.
<s> -- That was the place... and you were the guy.
<s> I love you now, I'll love you always --
<s> -- Yes?
<s> Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
<s> Good night to you, Bill.
<s> Good morning, Bill.
<s> Yes?
<s> Of course.
<s> Yes, Bill.
<s> Not this.
<s> I understand.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
<s> It's all yours.
<s> Why didn't you stop me?
<s> And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
<s> Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
<s> Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
<s> Well, they're mine now.
<s> With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
<s> Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
<s> Thank you.
<s> I am not a dream.
<s> Death!
<s> Then don't.
<s> I don't!
<s> There's going to be plenty of time for that.
<s> Time.
<s> You think Drew will go for it?
<s> Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
<s> No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
<s> He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
<s> Nothing.
<s> Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
<s> I'm having a helluva time.
<s> Oh, yes --
<s> The fireworks are about to start.
<s> I agree --
<s> So you're a one-girl guy?
<s> Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
<s> Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
<s> Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
<s> Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
<s> I think I know her.
<s> What's it like?
<s> As requested.
<s> Seen you together, that's all.
<s> What?
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
<s> Leonard.
<s> * I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
<s> What the fuck are you doing here?
<s> Yeah, I remember you.
<s> So you have information for me?
<s> Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Did you?
<s> What happened?
<s> Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
<s> Where is he?
<s> No!
<s> Why not?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
<s> What are you here for?
<s> I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
<s> I enjoy it.
<s> Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
<s> Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
<s> Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
<s> Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
<s> Why?
<s> He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
<s> Teddy. Your buddy.
<s> How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
<s> The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
<s> Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
<s> You can't just take it!
<s> His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
<s> Doing...?
<s> Turn around.
<s> I was the kids' godfather.
<s> Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
<s> They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
<s> Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
<s> You can't.
<s> ...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
<s> And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
<s> 25% discount on the load.
<s> Okay.
<s> Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
<s> Havana.
<s> Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
<s> No.
<s> Died in childbirth, having me...
<s> Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
<s> 'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
<s> Hola, viejo.
<s> When?
<s> Of course.
<s> I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
<s> What'd Neptune tell you?
<s> Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
<s> The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
<s> White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
<s> What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
<s> Port-Au-Prince.
<s> No.
<s> As in...?
<s> From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
<s> I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
<s> Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
<s> He did volunteer one time...
<s> What's it say?
<s> ...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
<s> They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
<s> What would you do...?
<s> Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
<s> Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
<s> I had to lay eyes on you.
<s> Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
<s> It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
<s> Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
<s> Yeah, oh yeah.
<s> No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
<s> I ain't sleepy.
<s> What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
<s> Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
<s> For money for what?
<s> Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
<s> So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
<s> Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
<s> What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
<s> Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
<s> Yeah, well, so?
<s> Who?
<s> I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
<s> How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
<s> I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
<s> Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
<s> Well, not too, I mean, a little.
<s> Instant V-goddam-D.
<s> I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
<s> Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
<s> It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
<s> The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
<s> Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
<s> For the money... )
<s> About ten kilometers.
<s> Stupid.
<s> But just...
<s> I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
<s> Something like that. Cigarette?
<s> He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
<s> ...She was on the plane.
<s> Lucky girl.
<s> Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> And?
<s> Two thirty.
<s> Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
<s> Yeah? Where?
<s> I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
<s> Work, work, work, that's all do
<s> Who got the Frenchman out?
<s> I think so. One right, two lefts...
<s> Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
<s> How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
<s> Depends.  You got a memo?
<s> What?
<s> Manny...
<s> Please.
<s> Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
<s> Maybe they lied to you.
<s> I heard how you talked to him.
<s> No such thing, baby.
<s> I was just late.
<s> No.
<s> They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
<s> We can do it!
<s> That's it?
<s> I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
<s> No shit.
<s> I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
<s> I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
<s> Sure.
<s> I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
<s> How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
<s> How long...?
<s> Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
<s> And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
<s> It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
<s> My daughter must be going nuts.
<s> I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
<s> I can live with "great."
<s> Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
<s> Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
<s> Show me the way?
<s> I don't know.
<s> If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
<s> I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
<s> No, just the paper will be fine.
<s> Annie, what's the matter?
<s> What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
<s> The what?
<s> You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
<s> Have to wait.
<s> A toast?
<s> Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
<s> Why would you lose me?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Be my guest.
<s> It will.
<s> What? What is it?
<s> Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
<s> Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
<s> Oh, I like that tone.
<s> He's your client, huh?
<s> Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
<s> Buster.
<s> We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
<s> Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
<s> No, the typing kind.
<s> That'd be a first.
<s> Hugh, I'm impressed..
<s> Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
<s> What else?
<s> If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
<s> In downtown Sydney for a start.
<s> Why, you going to make me a better offer?
<s> A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
<s> Not for seven more minutes.
<s> He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
<s> Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
<s> Oh, either way works for me.
<s> Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
<s> Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
<s> Which is?
<s> So do I.  Sort of.
<s> This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
<s> You can be a thief and have a conscience.
<s> This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
<s> Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
<s> Oh Ethan!..
<s> Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
<s> I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
<s> No.  You just looked as if you did.
<s> Like?
<s> Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
<s> The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
<s> - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
<s> Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
<s> Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
<s> We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
<s> Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
<s> She sacrificed herself..
<s> Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
<s> Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
<s> I'm fine..
<s> You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
<s> Nyah still on the property?
<s> No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
<s> Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
<s> Good job.  And thanks.
<s> Yes, Anatoly, yes.
<s> All ten million.
<s> Krieger.
<s> If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
<s> Roger that.
<s> Who is "they?"
<s> No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
<s> Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
<s> What about you?
<s> We did what we had to do.
<s> Is this the only way?
<s> You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
<s> Theyre dead.
<s> Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
<s> I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
<s> Information.
<s> Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
<s> Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
<s> I'll get you close.
<s> I need one hundred thousand dollars.
<s> That's the question I want to ask Job.
<s> Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
<s> I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
<s> Bank?
<s> Jack.
<s> Just waiting for you, tubs.
<s> Can you lose him?
<s> About two hundred yards from the bridge.
<s> I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
<s> I don't know.
<s> And a lonely ass.
<s> Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
<s> Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
<s> Very good.
<s> I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
<s> No. You were there.
<s> You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
<s> Bed.
<s> I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
<s> What's your news?
<s> You did this once it didn't work out.
<s> What killed him?
<s> Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
<s> What'd you do to your hair?
<s> Who is this man? You're engaged!
<s> Alright. I didn't see you here.
<s> And what did they say?
<s> I don't know. I got a feeling.
<s> Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
<s> I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
<s> Maybe I should come back another time.
<s> But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
<s> You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
<s> Loretta.
<s> Instantaneous.
<s> Just Johnny.
<s> You really are stupid, you know that.
<s> No!
<s> Because I have no Luck!
<s> I am looking where I should to become a bride!
<s> Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
<s> All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
<s> Oh no I didn't!
<s> I can't do that!
<s> Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
<s> Hi.
<s> Awful?
<s> Yeah.
<s> How can you ask me that?
<s> I was.
<s> No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
<s> Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
<s> You? No.
<s> Never is a long time.
<s> My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
<s> What?
<s> Yes?
<s> This is a good suit.
<s> Alright.
<s> I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
<s> Who is he?
<s> Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
<s> We should talk alone.
<s> In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
<s> I'm thirty-seven years old.
<s> Where you been?
<s> Cosmo's cheating on me.
<s> A wife knows.
<s> Did you see it?
<s> Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
<s> Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
<s> Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
<s> Johnny...
<s> Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
<s> Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
<s> Sure!
<s> Will you join me for dinner?
<s> Why do men chase women?
<s> You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
<s> Well. That explains it.
<s> Oh.
<s> What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
<s> Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
<s> And what do you burn, apart from witches?
<s> Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
<s> But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
<s> The Britons.
<s> Who are they?
<s> We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
<s> Now - go!
<s> I've had worse.
<s> Course I have.
<s> What!  Just a flesh wound. 
<s> Come, Patsy.
<s> This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
<s> This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
<s> No.  No.  No!
<s> Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
<s> It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.

<s> Quite.
<s> A G...g...g...
<s> There.
<s> It is the rabbit.
<s> Be quiet!
<s> Shut up!
<s> Come on, patsy.
<s> Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
<s> ... Well, we did do the nose.
<s> And the hat.  But she is a witch.
<s> Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
<s> I'm not dead!
<s> Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
<s> When's your next round?
<s> That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
<s> I think I could pull through, sir.
<s> Farewell, Concorde!
<s> Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
<s> Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
<s> Is it?
<s> I'm ... your son ...
<s> Got it?
<s> Yes?
<s> Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
<s> What?
<s> The Prince ... ?
<s> The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
<s> What is your name, handsome knight?
<s> Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
<s> I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
<s> Camelot ...
<s> Why?
<s> Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
<s> No, no, no.
<s> Not down south you don't.
<s> I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
<s> You watch your tongue.
<s> It's a diary.
<s> Mary Taylor, sir.
<s> Kitchen and lower house.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't think I've had that pleasure.
<s> Are you deaf as well as stupid?
<s> I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
<s> Whom you address.
<s> And that is my last word on the matter.
<s> Who'll bring it to me?
<s> Aye, do.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
<s> We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
<s> I don't think about it.
<s> Aye.
<s> She trusts you, John.
<s> But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
<s> I am.
<s> She's well, too.
<s> I'm glad of it.
<s> Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
<s> And I intend to be there when she's ready.
<s> It's a fine spot, ma'am.
<s> Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
<s> Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
<s> Then why send me back to them?!
<s> But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
<s> So?
<s> Who?
<s> The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
<s> Dear oh dear.
<s> Of course.
<s> Just them?
<s> I understand he was in a fight.
<s> Again?
<s> What is it?
<s> My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
<s> He is sick, ma'am.
<s> You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
<s> Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
<s> Yeah, who isn't.
<s> How do you do that?
<s> He?
<s> He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
<s> Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
<s> But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> It's twelve-thirty!
<s> No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
<s> You imagined it.
<s> No way.
<s> She thought Benz was at school.
<s> Laurie's.
<s> It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
<s> Like the fractals?
<s> What?
<s> Drives 'em crazy every time.
<s> I can't believe you made it!
<s> What?
<s> The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
<s> One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
<s> There never is.
<s> Then we'll go home.
<s> Yes...but...how did you...
<s> In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
<s> It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
<s> What did you say?
<s> The Cowboy??
<s> Yeah.
<s> How's that?
<s> Okay, I'm thinking.
<s> Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
<s> I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
<s> I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
<s> That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
<s> Yes, he is. He raises corn.
<s> Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
<s> Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
<s> But you won't.
<s> I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
<s> We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
<s> Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
<s> "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
<s> "Then they'd put you in jail."
<s> Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
<s> What is it? What do you see?!
<s> Keep going. Go around to the back.
<s> C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
<s> It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
<s> And who are we auditioning for today?
<s> Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
<s> Damn, that's a long drive.
<s> Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
<s> It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
<s> Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
<s> Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
<s> Yeah, I'd say that's it.
<s> You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
<s> Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
<s> You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
<s> Give me a fucking.....
<s> It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
<s> Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
<s> What ?
<s> Why would he ? His parents are rich.
<s> I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
<s> Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
<s> Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
<s> What do you mean ?
<s> So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
<s> Because of my charming personality ?
<s> You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
<s> What the fuck are you talking about.
<s> Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
<s> Got it.
<s> Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
<s> Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
<s> If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
<s> Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
<s> I am thirty two.
<s> I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
<s> Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
<s> Sir ?
<s> Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
<s> Then what do you want ?
<s> I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
<s> Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes.
<s> As appealing as that sounds...
<s> Thanks.
<s> Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
<s> Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
<s> Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> We made it !
<s> Where are we ?
<s> Hey buddy. You okay ?
<s> I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
<s> Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
<s> Are you writing a poem?
<s> I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
<s> You're still asking me to break the law.
<s> Me, I'll know!
<s> What do you remember about her.
<s> Suspended from school, my mother??
<s> Well you know what I mean.
<s> Seriously?
<s> Great.
<s> Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
<s> Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
<s> Was it a nice funeral?
<s> I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
<s> If I eat it I'll throw up.
<s> I was pushing as fast as I could.
<s> Maybe he's hungry.
<s> Oh.  Ohhh?
<s> Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
<s> Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
<s> oh.
<s> It's just a corpse.
<s> It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
<s> Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
<s> But I wanna write about her.
<s> O.K. Thank you very much.
<s> Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
<s> I want juice!
<s> And you're gonna solve the mystery?
<s> Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
<s> Just remember the needle in the haystack.
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> Change my name.
<s> Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
<s> Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
<s> This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
<s> You would.
<s> I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
<s> Just give it to me!!
<s> What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
<s> This is a totally barbaric custom.
<s> I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
<s> I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
<s> Ten bucks.
<s> You're a good man Nicholas.
<s> Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
<s> I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
<s> You want me to come with?
<s> Phil for God sake.
<s> Oh...what's that?
<s> You know how I feel about you.
<s> Is that a yes?
<s> What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> She'll be all right baby.
<s> Bye Niece, Vada.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
<s> All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
<s> Oh, sure okay.
<s> Is there milk in them already?
<s> Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
<s> I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
<s> Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
<s> You have no idea.
<s> Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
<s> Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
<s> I like to buy off all the railroads.
<s> Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
<s> WHAT?
<s> This guy bonking you?
<s> Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
<s> I'm impressed.
<s> No.
<s> Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
<s> Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
<s> Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
<s> She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
<s> She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
<s> Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
<s> I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
<s> Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
<s> Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
<s> I'll second that.
<s> Ya, that rack holds six ties.
<s> Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Hi.
<s> No sweetheart, you can't.
<s> He was allergic to bees.
<s> There were just too many of 'em.
<s> Get away, get away!!
<s> No, no.
<s> I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
<s> Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
<s> Oh come on.
<s> Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
<s> Will you tell her I came by?
<s> Thank you. Bye.
<s> It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
<s> It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
<s> I wrote a poem too.
<s> That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
<s> I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
<s> Do you think she is?
<s> Why do you think she says that?
<s> Chocolate?
<s> I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
<s> Thomas?
<s> Have you ever tried any?
<s> Hi.
<s> What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
<s> I'm eleven and a half.
<s> I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
<s> Hi Mr. Bixler!
<s> You could pick that scab on your arm.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
<s> What?
<s> I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
<s> What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
<s> Go???
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
<s> He likes her better than me.
<s> No, I'm hiding out.
<s> Well, let's spit on it.
<s> Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
<s> Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
<s> He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
<s> Desperate.  To talk.
<s> You've been working on this, huh?
<s> I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
<s> That was Thursday.
<s> I can't even say it.
<s> And what will he do?
<s> A trademark move, don't touch it.
<s> It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
<s> Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
<s> Let me rephrase that...
<s> No.
<s> I was gonna predict that.
<s> Ju...
<s> ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
<s> Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
<s> Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
<s> Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
<s> Only.  If he wants to.
<s> We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
<s> This must be... very, very, hard on him.
<s> That's entirely understandable.
<s> It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
<s> I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
<s> Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
<s> I know Ben.
<s> It doesn't say th...
<s> He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
<s> I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
<s> Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
<s> But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
<s> Endearingly absent-minded.
<s> Quite the little eccentric.
<s> Boy, those were the days.
<s> Like I said, dazzling.
<s> You keep saying that.
<s> The night we met.
<s> Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
<s> Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
<s> "Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
<s> Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
<s> I came here, looking for her.
<s> Like family, huh?
<s> This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
<s> Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
<s> An so it is.
<s> Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
<s> I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
<s> Green.
<s> I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
<s> She's going to rest now.
<s> Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
<s> Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
<s> Minimum.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Can I help you?
<s> I think we can do that. Come in.
<s> She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
<s> It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
<s> What did you say?
<s> I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
<s> A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
<s> No.
<s> Next you'll be sick.
<s> He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
<s> It just is.
<s> Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
<s> Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
<s> Who is this?  It's Tom.
<s> Wow!
<s> I've got a gig tonight.
<s> I have to go.
<s> I'm not sure...
<s> Money's no object.
<s> Hello.
<s> Might be good for you.
<s> How long have you been together?
<s> Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
<s> We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
<s> Where are you from?
<s> You think I got any kind of a voice?
<s> You think I should take lessons?
<s> Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
<s> The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
<s> Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
<s> Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
<s> Don't stop!
<s> Using the same doctors is not common practice.
<s> You been followin' the news coverage?
<s> Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
<s> How's it goin'?
<s> Not good.
<s> She sings? What does she sing?
<s> I'm keen with anticipation.
<s> Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
<s> It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
<s> Out front.
<s> Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
<s> Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
<s> Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
<s> They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
<s> And a snake-eye glare.
<s> Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
<s> They actually apologized.
<s> That's my opinion.
<s> I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
<s> You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
<s> Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
<s> Perfecto!
<s> They're mesmerising.
<s> Why?
<s> But you'll never be whole again.
<s> That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
<s> Okay. I'll take two guys off.
<s> I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
<s> Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
<s> Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
<s> That'll be thirty-eight cents.
<s> That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
<s> Well, what d'you know?!
<s> Don't start no trouble, boy!
<s> I'll smile when it's funny.
<s> Where's Wilma?
<s> Like where?
<s> Okay.
<s> Guess I don't.
<s> Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
<s> Have anything in mind?
<s> Well, he worked around.
<s> That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
<s> That ain't my idea of friendliness.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Yeah. On the section gang.
<s> You work around town?
<s> Oh yeah? That's my home town.
<s> You don't think much of yourself, do you?
<s> Well, I don't get on so well most places.
<s> Why did you?
<s> No.
<s> I didn't know you had one.
<s> Are you married?
<s> Four.
<s> I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
<s> Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
<s> It'll be fine when we get done with it.
<s> Am I as good as they?
<s> You jivin' me?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
<s> 'Round town.
<s> You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> She'll do.
<s> Yeah, sure. Good luck.
<s> Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
<s> That's right.
<s> No, they won't.
<s> Who is?!
<s> How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
<s> Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
<s> It's for your own good.
<s> You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
<s> Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
<s> How you doin'?  Hi there!
<s> 'Musta knocked her up.
<s> I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
<s> Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
<s> That'll make the folks very happy.
<s> Okay, boy, beat it.
<s> Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
<s> My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
<s> I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
<s> You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
<s> Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
<s> No, but it traced me.
<s> Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
<s> Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
<s> You see the couple up in the balcony?
<s> This ain't Bangkok, chief.
<s> The words?
<s> Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
<s> Yeah.
<s> As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
<s> Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
<s> You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
<s> I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
<s> Nobody has.
<s> It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
<s> Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
<s> The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
<s> Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
<s> Case.
<s> There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
<s> Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
<s> Why should I want to meet him.
<s> Couple of days. They'll examine you.
<s> What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
<s> Too late?
<s> Dixie McCoy didn't.
<s> Case...
<s> No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
<s> What is it?
<s> Well, do you?
<s> Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
<s> Yes, it's lame.
<s>  uhh, must have forgotten-
<s> Right. 7:30.
<s> Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
<s> Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
<s> OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
<s> I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
<s> 'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
<s> Anita!
<s> Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
<s> Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
<s> It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
<s> Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
<s> Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
<s> You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
<s> But I don't want it straightened out.
<s> Oh. Right.
<s> Have you been there?
<s> Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
<s> I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
<s> You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
<s> Hey. There.
<s> Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
<s> No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
<s> No. Josie, this is real.
<s> This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
<s> With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
<s> And a gymnast!
<s> wasn't even thinking about-
<s> I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
<s> Sorry. Forgetful.
<s> Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
<s> Oh I don't think so.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
<s> That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
<s> You were attracted to me?
<s> What?
<s> Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
<s> We went through the door...
<s> Barrel.
<s> For this.
<s> Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
<s> I can't help it.
<s> But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
<s> <i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<s> Specifically.
<s> Maybe he doesn't know...
<s> It's getting there.
<s> And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
<s> Where's Jesse?
<s> Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
<s> What about it?
<s> She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
<s> Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
<s> It was okay.
<s> Only the wet ones.
<s> I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
<s> No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
<s> It's happening again.
<s> How come?
<s> Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
<s> I know.
<s> Wow...
<s> What's this?
<s> About what?
<s> yeah, I had a bad night.
<s> What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
<s> We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
<s> I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
<s> he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
<s> You okay?
<s> Okay, I guess.
<s> Hi, Kerry.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
<s> Deal.  Thanks.
<s> Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
<s> How do we find him, Kristen?
<s> I think so.
<s> So?
<s> A little basic, but nice.
<s> She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
<s> Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
<s> So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
<s> Didn't get much sleep.
<s> Sounds like a rough time.
<s> That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
<s> You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
<s> Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
<s> Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
<s> There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
<s> I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
<s> No...
<s> Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
<s> Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
<s> What about Kristen?
<s> Neil, please --
<s> Don't worry, it won't come to that.
<s> There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
<s> I won't allow it.
<s> Me too.
<s> Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
<s> I'm delighted.
<s> Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
<s> I forgot my bag.
<s> Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
<s> You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
<s> Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
<s> Let's go in.
<s> You've got to go.
<s> Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
<s> Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
<s> Oh no no -- no.
<s> 'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
<s> Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
<s> Yes.  Always have had.
<s> No.  What's that?
<s> Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
<s> What?
<s> But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
<s> Stay forever.
<s> Undressed like this, yes.
<s> How do you think I'm doing?
<s> That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
<s> I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
<s> Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
<s> Okay.
<s> Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
<s> What's the thing?
<s> Is that right?
<s> I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
<s> Miracles do happen.
<s> He wouldn't say.
<s> Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
<s> He's cooking guinea fowl?
<s> Is Miss Scott staying here?
<s> And we intend to use them!
<s> No -- it's my 22nd.
<s> Working with Leonardo.
<s> It was good.
<s> Blimey.  What's that?
<s> Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
<s> How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
<s> Yes?
<s> Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
<s> Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
<s> Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
<s> She's perfect, perfect.
<s> That's not fair.
<s> But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
<s> May I help you, sir?
<s> What are the choices?
<s> Point taken.
<s> Two?  That's it?
<s> I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
<s> Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
<s> Right -- let's talk about rent...
<s> I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
<s> So?
<s> Would you like to start?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yes, Mister McMurphy?
<s> Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
<s> Right!
<s> Go on...
<s> Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
<s> A vote is before the group.
<s> Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
<s> Thank you, ma'am.
<s> B-B-Billy.
<s> Wh-wh-wh-wh...
<s> Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
<s> Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
<s> C-C-C-C-Candy!
<s> M-M-M-Mack?
<s> P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
<s> No.
<s> That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
<s> Yeah, Mack?
<s> Yeah!
<s> Shhh...
<s> Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
<s> Through the ass.
<s> A pecking party?
<s> I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
<s> What for?
<s> Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
<s> What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
<s> I just started!
<s> No!
<s> What's he talkin' about?
<s> Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
<s> A nickel.
<s> I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
<s> Me, too! Me, too!
<s> He's not!
<s> McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
<s> Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
<s> Time out!
<s> 'Kay!
<s> Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
<s> You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
<s> I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
<s> Sure...
<s> Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
<s> You's better believe it, brother!
<s> Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
<s> I'm sure you will.
<s> Oh...
<s> Tha's your problem.
<s> Now you talkin'.
<s> Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
<s> Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
<s> Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
<s> Is he one of the loonies?
<s> He's dead.
<s> Oh, yeah...
<s> Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
<s> Your hair... is perfect.
<s> Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
<s> Yes.  We did.
<s> Oh no.  Do you?
<s> Except possibly that.
<s> Dwayne?
<s> Hm.
<s> Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
<s> Who's this?
<s> I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
<s> Yes.
<s> You didn't answer my question.
<s> So it wasn't real.
<s> Who says I don't love him?...
<s> Mickey Spillane?
<s> Right now?
<s> You too.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
<s> No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
<s> No.  Course not.
<s> There is no us.
<s> Well, not exactly...
<s> Oh, hello.
<s> A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
<s> Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
<s> You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
<s> Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
<s> No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
<s> Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
<s> Is he gay?
<s> I don't know, Kate.
<s> No...  I can just tell.
<s> What about your job?
<s> You don't have a passport.
<s> Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
<s> You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
<s> You're coming with me?
<s> He fell out.
<s> Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
<s> We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
<s> I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
<s> Oh my God.  Where?
<s> Is he looking at us?
<s> Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
<s> I meant about my idea.
<s> Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
<s> But how could he know?  He only just met me.
<s> My God... you're right.
<s> So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
<s> And Larry?...
<s> Kate.
<s> She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
<s> Right.
<s> You used to love it when I called you doll.
<s> It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
<s> I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
<s> Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
<s> Mania.
<s> When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!
<s> We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
<s> I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
<s> We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
<s> I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
<s> That was the idea.
<s> They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
<s> Don't say that!
<s> Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
<s> Hello, Edie.
<s> You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
<s> Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in
<s> How would you've done it?
<s> What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
<s> Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
<s> Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
<s> If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
<s> All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
<s> I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
<s> I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
<s> Terry, what's wrong?
<s> Who says?
<s> I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
<s> I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
<s> I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
<s> I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
<s> I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
<s> Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
<s> I thought you might want some hot coffee.
<s> Terry...?
<s> You are like
<s> I don't want to hear it in there.
<s> Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
<s> I'll find you a priest.
<s> Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
<s> A question of who rides who.
<s> Good luck.
<s> Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
<s> Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
<s> Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
<s> Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
<s> What about it?
<s> You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
<s> If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.
<s> Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
<s> Raise a hand to me and... .
<s> O.K., O.K., That's enough.
<s> Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
<s> Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
<s> But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
<s> Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
<s> Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
<s> I was only talkin' to her.
<s> Go on, beat it!
<s> When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
<s> What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
<s> I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
<s> I'm not sure...
<s> What can we do against them?
<s> I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
<s> A situation easily remedied.
<s> Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
<s> The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
<s> There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
<s> Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
<s> Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
<s> Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
<s> Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
<s> Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
<s> Tell me, how do you do that?
<s> From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
<s> They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
<s> He'd call every once in a while.
<s> Really.  Hm.
<s> Till they got busted.
<s> Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
<s> Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
<s> I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
<s> You're right.
<s> I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
<s> Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
<s> You better come see this.
<s> Her phone's probably tapped.
<s> Now you're talkin'.
<s> Love is funny.
<s> Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
<s> I saw Karen Sisco.
<s> It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
<s> Yeah, I did.
<s> And who watches your back?
<s> I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
<s> You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
<s> I'll go with you.
<s> That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
<s> Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
<s> When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
<s> And what happened to Carl?
<s> Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
<s> What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
<s> Why you think is today?
<s> You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
<s> I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
<s> How are you, Raymond?
<s> Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
<s> Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
<s> No, I didn't know that.
<s> Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
<s> Wait, I know him --okay?
<s> Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
<s> In my bag, in the car.
<s> Buddy.  That's his given name?
<s> I thought so, too.
<s> Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
<s> What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
<s> It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
<s> Really.
<s> Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
<s> Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
<s> Those guys bother you?
<s> I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
<s> I called your room from downstairs.
<s> Yeah, but in a nice way.
<s> What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
<s> What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
<s> Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
<s> My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
<s> Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
<s> How many?
<s> I don't know.  I never used a gun.
<s> You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
<s> The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
<s> Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
<s> I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
<s> For a time.
<s> That time?
<s> We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
<s> Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
<s> I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
<s> Really?
<s> I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
<s> Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
<s> You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
<s> Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
<s> Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
<s> I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
<s> Me?
<s> Can I do what?
<s> I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
<s> Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
<s> Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
<s> Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Something better.  Open it.
<s> Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
<s> Then they're not separated, are they?
<s> You used to like it.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
<s> I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
<s> I didn't have time.
<s> So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
<s> Are those <i>my</i> suits?
<s> Where the fuck is Foley?
<s> Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
<s> Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
<s> Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
<s> The Colonel helped me work it out.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You left her.  How's that for a fact?
<s> How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
<s> Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
<s> Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
<s> I'm out of fuel!
<s> Home of the Brave.
<s> He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
<s> Y-Yes Sir.
<s> How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
<s> Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
<s> Respect.
<s> The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
<s> Do one thing for me, before you go.
<s> How did you?...
<s> Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
<s> If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
<s> We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
<s> We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
<s> If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
<s> I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
<s> Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
<s> Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
<s> Goodbye, Grandma.
<s> Stag movies. Smokers.
<s> I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
<s> It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
<s> How do you like my hair?
<s> Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
<s> Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
<s> That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
<s> Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
<s> I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
<s> Maybe I blocked it out.
<s> Why wait?
<s> They'll learn to live with it.
<s> What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
<s> Who?
<s> You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
<s> And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
<s> Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
<s> I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
<s> I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
<s> Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
<s> Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
<s> It opens, too. Look inside.
<s> Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
<s> You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
<s> Okay.
<s> I wish she hadn't.
<s> But I'm remembering the future.
<s> He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
<s> I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
<s> But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
<s> Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
<s> They care about you. They're just a different generation.
<s> Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
<s> That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
<s> What a treat.
<s> Can we split now?
<s> What?
<s> At my age? Don't be silly.
<s> Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
<s> I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
<s> This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
<s> Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
<s> I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
<s> The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
<s> Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
<s> Oh. I forgot.
<s> Sure, Mom.  Hello.
<s> I don't feel very festive.
<s> I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
<s> We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
<s> Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
<s> Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
<s> But accidents can happen.
<s> You're a sweet man, Richard.
<s> It really wasn't that difficult.
<s> That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
<s> What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
<s> How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
<s> Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> High tech. I like the sound of that.
<s> Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
<s> I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
<s> I couldn't help it  I loved him.
<s> It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
<s> How'd you know that?
<s> God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
<s> I had a little run-in with Zowie.
<s> I'll be fine, Dad.
<s> Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
<s> Zowie.
<s> Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
<s> I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
<s> All the time.
<s> Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
<s> I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
<s> Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
<s> Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
<s> There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
<s> Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
<s> Yeah. Thanks, guys.
<s> I said, don't worry about it.
<s> He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
<s> I promise!
<s> Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
<s> Honesty is always best.
<s> I have AIDS.
<s> They sabotaged me.
<s> I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
<s> Charles. Okay. Miller?
<s> Do you... pray?
<s> Thanks.  Do you like opera?
<s> I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
<s> Yes.
<s> Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
<s> Gay movies.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
<s> That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
<s> Hi, Mom. It's me.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
<s> Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
<s> Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
<s> Uh.... No. Not really.
<s> We were satisfied.
<s> Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
<s> What kind of people?
<s> Do I look gay to you? Relax.
<s> Okay, Joe...
<s> My lettuce is wilting.
<s> So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
<s> Helloooo...
<s> Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
<s> ... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
<s> It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
<s> 'Mean the whispers?
<s> You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
<s> Saw something I didn't like.
<s> You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
<s> Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
<s> Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
<s> No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
<s> Don't do this to me....
<s> I would try for them.
<s> Not sure. Ten?
<s> I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
<s> Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
<s> What?
<s> Like what?
<s> I assume he licked it clean.
<s> Let's just be sure.
<s> Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
<s> Let's wait on the power cells.
<s> That's what I said.
<s> I never said I was.
<s> We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
<s> Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
<s> -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
<s> Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
<s> And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
<s> One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
<s> What?
<s> Has anyone checked the coring room?
<s> I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
<s> Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
<s> Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
<s> I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
<s> Said "looks clear."
<s> Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
<s> No. She's not.
<s> They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
<s> Just realized that, huh?
<s> Not if I'm the one.
<s> Nice embellishment.
<s> Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
<s> So much for my cocktail hour.
<s> You still don't believe me, do you?
<s> Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
<s> It's probably wrong --
<s> Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
<s> Zira....
<s> Yo!
<s> Let's find them all.
<s> Blessed are the vegetarians.
<s> Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
<s> I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
<s> Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
<s> See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
<s> Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
<s> There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
<s> Taylor.	I'm telling you --
<s> Okay.
<s> If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
<s> In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
<s> Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
<s> I think you're making a mistake.
<s> What?
<s> Why special?
<s> At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
<s> Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
<s> Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
<s> Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
<s> I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
<s> My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
<s> I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
<s> That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
<s> Then you admit --
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
<s> When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
<s> Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
<s> Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
<s> Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
<s> A hearing.
<s> Which one?
<s> Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
<s> He doesn't know.
<s> But there's the doll, sir.
<s> He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
<s> How the hell did he get away?
<s> Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
<s> YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
<s> Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
<s> Says he can't walk.
<s> Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
<s> Yeah, what is it?
<s> Fuck you bitch.
<s> I got one...
<s> Over here!
<s> Barnes believes in what he's doing.
<s> Nah...
<s> Who gives a shit!
<s> I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
<s> They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
<s> This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
<s> If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
<s> Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> I haven't been invited.
<s> How do you do?
<s> No, please.
<s> I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
<s> I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
<s> Do you think I don't?
<s> On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
<s> He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
<s> So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
<s> Absolutely sure.
<s> All right--following me.
<s> No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
<s> This must have cost a fortune.
<s> Do you have to leave the note?
<s> That, and the fun of it.
<s> The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
<s> You-killed-him?
<s> And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
<s> If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
<s> I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
<s> Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
<s> You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
<s> You were there when I last saw him.
<s> The police always do, don't they?
<s> You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
<s> Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
<s> You understand perfectly.
<s> There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
<s> What does he see?
<s> Very ridiculous.
<s> I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
<s> I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
<s> This way.
<s> You asked for it.
<s> $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
<s> For five hundred, what do I get?
<s> For two hundred?
<s> Leave that one lay.
<s> I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
<s> I don't.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> Doesn't answer the question.
<s> Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
<s> Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
<s> How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
<s> Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
<s> I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
<s> Go live in a tent.
<s> Open it and count it.
<s> They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
<s> Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
<s> Should be over there.
<s> Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
<s> Pretty big chance, huh?
<s> Well.  What about it?
<s> Did we ever really think it was suicide?
<s> And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
<s> You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
<s> I'll take your word.
<s> The card says so, doesn't it?
<s> A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
<s> I don't know, sir.
<s> Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
<s> Two.
<s> Why should I mind?
<s> She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
<s> I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
<s> I say YES!
<s> Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
<s> To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
<s> Well, we were just...
<s> Sit on that log, dear.
<s> I see.
<s> No.  I'd want to--
<s> Yes, please.
<s> And to history.
<s> I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
<s> And you're at this third stage
<s> I think she liked me.
<s> I might.
<s> Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
<s> Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
<s> It's shit.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> Ha ha...
<s> Will it be fun?
<s> Yes, finally.
<s> Are you up to something?
<s> All right.
<s> What about the Cromwells?
<s> No, thanks Dad.
<s> I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
<s> Darling Susan.
<s> In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
<s> We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
<s> After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
<s> You do it... you first!
<s> She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
<s> See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
<s> What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
<s> No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
<s> Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
<s> Zero distortion, sir.
<s> Not so far.
<s> Babes.
<s> What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
<s> Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
<s> So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
<s> Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
<s> Okay, Dad.
<s> Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
<s> Angelo, we gotta talk.
<s> Shrimp and fries.
<s> Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
<s> Warm them up.
<s> Betadyne doesn't hurt.
<s> I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
<s> What about the rest of Hopper's men?
<s> Something... in the trees...
<s> Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
<s> This gets better by the minute.
<s> You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
<s> Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
<s> Right behind you.
<s> What, Sergeant?
<s> Thank you, Sergeant.
<s> There's something else, Major...
<s> No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
<s> He's not really my uncle.
<s> You're not getting any navy contracts.
<s> I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
<s> You're making the right decision, sir.
<s> You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
<s> What's that?
<s> Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
<s> Sure.  For five bucks.
<s> If you can figure it out, be my guest.
<s> What motel you staying at?
<s> Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
<s> You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
<s> Edward.  My name is Edward.
<s> What?
<s> Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
<s> Right.  So!  In town on business?
<s> Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
<s> Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
<s> If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
<s> Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
<s> I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
<s> Mmm, I could tell.
<s> "Occupational hazard".
<s> Any good?
<s> I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
<s> Good.
<s> No.
<s> Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
<s> Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
<s> I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
<s> What happened to him?
<s> I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
<s> I more than liked it.
<s> You just did.
<s> It was a business decision.
<s> Vivian...
<s> Thank you.
<s> Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
<s> Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
<s> Oh, god, what?
<s> We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
<s> Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
<s> Vivian's in sales.
<s> Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
<s> I'm up.
<s> Why?
<s> Give me twenty minutes.
<s> I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
<s> Yes.
<s> Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
<s> In Beverly Hills?
<s> Everybody keeps starin' at me.
<s> What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
<s> Go for the bucks.
<s> No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
<s> I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
<s> I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
<s> And who is that?
<s> Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
<s> That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
<s> But I always eat like this.
<s> Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
<s> Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
<s> Yes.  Something... conservative.
<s> It's very expensive.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
<s> Do you remember me?
<s> I just might do that.
<s> I think it's great.
<s> So it's to be torture.
<s> Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
<s> I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
<s> "Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
<s> I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
<s> And what am I?
<s> Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
<s> This is true love. You think this happens every day?
<s> Well ... you were dead.
<s> What? -- go on --
<s> I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
<s> Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
<s> Who's Guilder?
<s> Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
<s> He's really very short on charm.
<s> How many could you handle?
<s> That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
<s> But you don't know where he is.
<s> Everybody ... MOVE!!
<s> We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
<s> What?
<s> -- murdered by pirates is good --
<s> Someday, you may not mind so much.
<s> Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
<s> Do you want me to go on with this?
<s> See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
<s> Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
<s> No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
<s> Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
<s> The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
<s> The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
<s> DEATH FIRST!!
<s> I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
<s> Who won? How did it end?
<s> I swear it will be done.
<s> Of course.
<s> -- offer me money --
<s> Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
<s> Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
<s> Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You are ready, then?
<s> Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
<s> You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
<s> Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
<s> You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
<s> Nobody's hearing nothing!
<s> Have fun storming the castle.
<s> What?
<s> That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
<s> Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
<s> In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
<s> Mr. Bialystock ...
<s> I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
<s> Oh, it's all right ... wha?
<s> You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
<s> Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
<s> What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
<s> Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
<s> You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
<s> Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
<s> Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
<s> Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
<s> Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
<s> It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
<s> He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
<s> Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
<s> That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
<s> Yes.  We would!
<s> Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
<s> Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
<s> I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
<s> Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
<s> Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
<s> No.  We go. 
<s> No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
<s> You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
<s> Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
<s> Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
<s> Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
<s> Ta.  Ta.
<s> Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
<s> Wagner...
<s> Bismark...
<s> Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
<s> Where are you going vit the light?
<s> What do you do best?
<s> In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
<s> No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
<s> I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
<s> How early?
<s> Of which morning?
<s> You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
<s> Back where?
<s> You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
<s> And when she left, she never came back.
<s> Someone is sitting in that window.
<s> I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
<s> Who are you, friend?
<s> She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
<s> Not even a hunch. Just hope.
<s> What?
<s> Of course not. Please.
<s> He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
<s> Buzz me the minute she comes in.
<s> Now. Your sister is missing how long?
<s> How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
<s> A lot?
<s> With the forty thousand dollars?
<s> Just what he told your detective.
<s> With you.
<s> To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
<s> I hate tears. 
<s> It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
<s> He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
<s> Maybe we can handle it together. 
<s> You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
<s> Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
<s> Why can't I go out there with you?
<s> Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
<s> I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
<s> All right! Then call! At least, call!
<s> Of course we will.
<s> We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
<s> Watch your tenses.
<s> Why not?
<s> Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
<s> Sam. This is the last time.
<s> I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
<s> It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
<s> We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
<s> Sam, let's go get married.
<s> The bathroom.
<s> You'd know, of course.
<s> Uncommon, too.
<s> It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
<s> I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
<s> I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
<s> Norman.
<s> Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
<s> Then I'm free to go...?
<s> Maybe you saw Mary!
<s> At this hour?
<s> Arbogast.
<s> I suppose you want a cabin.
<s> Yes.
<s> Left Phoenix under her own steam?
<s> From what?
<s> Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
<s> You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
<s> Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
<s> [Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
<s> Indeed, he has often told me.
<s> You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
<s> I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
<s> No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
<s> Maybe you want my money, too.
<s> Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
<s> Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
<s> Well, news of Buckley?
<s> Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
<s> It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
<s> I'm losing my blood!
<s> Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
<s> You would.
<s> What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
<s> I'm not quarreling, only ...
<s> So that's the way it is?
<s> Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
<s> And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
<s> That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
<s> All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
<s> Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
<s> Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
<s> I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
<s> Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
<s> No foolin' -- any suspect?
<s> Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
<s> Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
<s> Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
<s> My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
<s> We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
<s> No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
<s> All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
<s> That is unfortunate.
<s> That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
<s> They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
<s> Excuse me???
<s> I'm heading out of town.
<s> What universe are you in, Paul?
<s> God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
<s> That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
<s> They were just bad men, that's all.
<s> Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
<s> What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
<s> But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
<s> What did you expect?
<s> You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
<s> It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
<s> Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
<s> I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
<s> But Rose...
<s> Good night, Rose.
<s> I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
<s> Okay.
<s> What was your mother like?
<s> Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah, he's still up there.
<s> But how would you find him?
<s> Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
<s> Daddy, what's the matter?
<s> Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
<s> I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
<s> What are they doing?
<s> Here comes Daddy.
<s> Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
<s> Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
<s> Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
<s> First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
<s> I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
<s> What?
<s> Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
<s> Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
<s> I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
<s> The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
<s> Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
<s> Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
<s> Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
<s> Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
<s> Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
<s> Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
<s> That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
<s> What did you forget?
<s> She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
<s> Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
<s> All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
<s> Don't make me... me... me... get up!
<s> Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
<s> My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
<s> It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
<s> Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
<s> Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
<s> I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
<s> He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
<s> Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
<s> Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
<s> Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
<s> Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
<s> Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
<s> Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
<s> I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
<s> Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
<s> Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
<s> Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
<s> Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
<s> She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
<s> But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
<s> That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
<s> More history, Rose.
<s> Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
<s> Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
<s> What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
<s> Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
<s> ... okay... you made your point.
<s> Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
<s> I don't know.  Fuck off!
<s> What... ?
<s> Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
<s> She's fine, as if you cared.
<s> No you can't.
<s> Relax.
<s> They shot us all, kid.
<s> Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
<s> It's just the way things are, kiddo.
<s> We have to find Kittle.
<s> You're lying...
<s> What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
<s> There probably is.
<s> There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
<s> You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
<s> First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
<s> All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
<s> No you're not.
<s> You think this is so easy?
<s> I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
<s> Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
<s> Dead.
<s> A.D. is a C.P.A.
<s> Who is that... ?
<s> Seatbelts fastened, please.
<s> See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
<s> There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
<s> Keep 'em busy.
<s> That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
<s> They're... around.
<s> All right. Stand by.
<s> You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
<s> We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
<s> We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
<s> Yoda will always be with you.
<s> You cannot escape your destiny.
<s> Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
<s> She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
<s> I can't see.
<s> Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
<s> It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
<s> His lightsaber.
<s> There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
<s> Ahhh...
<s> He wasn't. I can feel it.
<s> No, wait! I thought you were blind!
<s> Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
<s> All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
<s> Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
<s> I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
<s> Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
<s> I see them. Wait, Leia!
<s> Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
<s> You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
<s> No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
<s> But, why must you confront him?
<s> I will not fight you, father.
<s> I will not fight you.
<s> Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
<s> Oh. Well, yes.
<s> Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
<s> I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
<s> Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
<s> Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
<s> Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
<s> For you.
<s> We must have a blow-out.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
<s> Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
<s> Cross my heart and hope to die.
<s> Makes you cry
<s> From Transexual Transylvania.
<s> Goodbye
<s> No no no no.
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
<s> You're too kind.
<s> Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
<s> ...I suppose.
<s> It doesn't bother me either.
<s> I don't think you're a bum.
<s> Morning after?
<s> 'Cause you can't sing or dance?
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> I think he might be worried.
<s> It's not that --
<s> I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
<s> I should leave.
<s> Do me another favor?
<s> I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
<s> They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
<s> -- The legs.
<s> Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
<s> ...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
<s> ...What?
<s> I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
<s> I gotta go out for a while.
<s> Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
<s> Paul.
<s> Christ.
<s> Paulie!
<s> It's not your house --
<s> You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
<s> Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
<s> You's the novelty, Champ!
<s> Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
<s> People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
<s> Get that doctor.
<s> One more round.
<s> Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
<s> That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
<s> ...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
<s> Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
<s> It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
<s> Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
<s> ...Fine.
<s> Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
<s> Do I have to pay juice?
<s> Rocky.
<s> I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
<s> Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
<s> Hey --
<s> I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
<s> Come July, twenty-five.
<s> Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
<s> Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
<s> You think everybody I fight is a bum.
<s> ...No.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Freak luck for sure.
<s> Yo, Benny.
<s> Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
<s> Great, kid, great.
<s> Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
<s> Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
<s> My sister's a friggin' loser.
<s> I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
<s> Let's get outta this stink.
<s> Gazzo's gotta come to you.
<s> Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
<s> Whatta you think?
<s> I dunno -- she fills gaps.
<s> Whatta these guys want?
<s> Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
<s> Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
<s> Shoulda guessed.
<s> Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
<s> No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
<s> I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
<s> He's a Toon... who cares?
<s> Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
<s> Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
<s> <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
<s> Maroon, right?
<s> Sounds like singin'.
<s> Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
<s> Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
<s> He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
<s> They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
<s> Why didn't you tell me?
<s> Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
<s> He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
<s> Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
<s> Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
<s> Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
<s> You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
<s> I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
<s> And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
<s> I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
<s> A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
<s> If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
<s> That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
<s> I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
<s> And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
<s> [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
<s> Uh? Uh?
<s> Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
<s> Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
<s> Why, what is Tybalt?
<s> Good-morrow, cousin.
<s> But new struck cuz.
<s> Of love?
<s> No, cuz, I rather weep.
<s> Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
<s> Teach me how I should forget to think.
<s> He shall be endured
<s> Be not so long to speak I long to die.
<s> What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
<s> Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
<s> O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
<s> And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
<s> No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
<s> Madam, I am here. What is your will?
<s> Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
<s> Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
<s> O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
<s> A thousand times good night! Exit, above
<s> Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
<s> Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
<s> Is she a Capulet?
<s> Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
<s> And who are you?
<s> Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
<s> I thought I did.
<s> Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
<s> They're good!
<s> Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
<s> Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
<s> Don't even think that I'm buying that.
<s> I didn't say I was.
<s> Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
<s> Ready when you are...
<s> He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
<s> There's been a slight problem.
<s> No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
<s> But you hate each other!
<s> Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
<s> I swear...
<s> I sent it to myself in Paris.
<s> Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
<s> I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
<s> What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
<s> That's it.
<s> Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
<s> Yes, Sam's tough alright.
<s> Of course.  Don't you?
<s> How did you know?
<s> Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
<s> Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
<s> I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
<s> Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Did he bring that with him?
<s> And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
<s> Eat shit and die slowly...
<s> You should learn a little patience.
<s> It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
<s> No thanks.
<s> That's what I thought.
<s> As in, they own it?
<s> And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
<s> Jujitsu.
<s> One's a lot more painful than the other.
<s> I do.
<s> Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
<s> You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
<s> Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
<s> A lot of people died.
<s> You see the bullet?
<s> It's my job.
<s> Very ugly.
<s> Because I owe you.  Look at that...
<s> I don't know...
<s> Closest and oldest.
<s> I'll work on it...
<s> Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
<s> How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
<s> Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
<s> Sure thing, and --
<s> The horniest dog in Nevada.
<s> They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
<s> There must be over a million dollars in here.
<s> Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
<s> I...I can't do that.
<s> That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
<s> It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
<s> Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
<s> What are you thinking?
<s> Okay then.  I'll do it.
<s> All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
<s> If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
<s> I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
<s> There it is...now what about the others?
<s> You killed him...
<s> I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
<s> That's right.
<s> He killed her...
<s> No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
<s> It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
<s> Rock solid.
<s> We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
<s> Two thousand...
<s> None of us like it!
<s> No.  It's not.
<s> Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
<s> OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
<s> Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
<s> What's that?
<s> Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
<s> I might have to look into that...
<s> Nothing.
<s> Oh.  You coming by tonight?
<s> Well I was just throwing out ideas...
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
<s> What did he buy?
<s> Could it have been this?
<s> A week ago, at most.
<s> How about you give us what you have and leave.
<s> First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
<s> Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
<s> Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
<s> Is this marked money, or what?
<s> Hi.
<s> Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
<s> Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
<s> So be here at three.
<s> I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
<s> Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
<s> Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
<s> And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
<s> I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
<s> And what happened?
<s> Anything in it?
<s> There was more than that.
<s> So...what's the good news?
<s> So someone did get away.
<s> Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
<s> No, I just assumed...
<s> Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
<s> You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
<s> I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> This is your ship?
<s> El Capitan?
<s> What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
<s> I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
<s> I don't think so...
<s> It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
<s> C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
<s> That's right.
<s> I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
<s> Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
<s> That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
<s> Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
<s> I knew you were lying.
<s> Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
<s> Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
<s> I'm okay, you go.
<s> Good at what?
<s> Ask me if I give a shit.
<s> IT IS CRAZY!
<s> I cannot go to LA...
<s> You said --
<s> Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
<s> He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
<s> I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
<s> Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
<s> She's walking back towards the door.
<s> It's your turn!
<s> For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
<s> I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
<s> Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
<s> I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
<s> No.
<s> Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
<s> I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
<s> They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
<s> Who's Benjamin?
<s> A Chinese man discovered electricity.
<s> End of the line.
<s> Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
<s> Carter...
<s> No problem.
<s> It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
<s> About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
<s> The Plaza Hotel?
<s> What "revenge" is he talking about?
<s> Fine with me.
<s> I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
<s> No.  But I'll help you.
<s> Baby Duck?
<s> The Secret Service?  Why?
<s> Put the plates down.  It's over.
<s> Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
<s> This is still Hong Kong.
<s> The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
<s> The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
<s> OK. Say what it is.
<s> So was I.
<s> Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
<s> No.
<s> I was being polite.
<s> Witnesses.
<s> I know a shortcut.
<s> What plate?
<s> No.
<s> Don't go there...
<s> Stooly.
<s> Come on!
<s> Yeah, it's good.
<s> No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
<s> I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
<s> No, fish is a PM food.
<s> It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
<s> Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
<s> Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
<s> Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
<s> No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
<s> Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
<s> Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
<s> No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
<s> Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
<s> At this point we don't have much.
<s> Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
<s> I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
<s> Or somethin'.
<s> I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
<s> I'm waitin' here for a name.
<s> Don't worry, he's with Carter.
<s> I still have work to do here.
<s> Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
<s> How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
<s> What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
<s> Good one!  Thanks.
<s> God bless you, Maggie.
<s> It's hurting.
<s> Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
<s> "Never say die."
<s> His hair... any color.
<s> No.  No, you didn't.
<s> Where do you think she's going?
<s> I don't know.
<s> You're coming here?
<s> Then you'll be my best man.
<s> Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
<s> Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
<s> And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
<s> Unbelievable, she got to you.
<s> No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
<s> Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
<s> -- The luau for Maggie.
<s> Originality is my speciality.
<s> We think so.
<s> A pre-wedding luau?
<s> Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
<s> I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
<s> I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
<s> He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
<s> Of course.
<s> It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
<s> No.  You take it.
<s> Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
<s> I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
<s> Or the sexual habits of locusts?
<s> I'd rather not.
<s> A little longer for me.
<s> Well, you do have the dress.
<s> So am I.
<s> I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
<s> I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
<s> I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
<s> Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
<s> I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
<s> See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
<s> Not eight...
<s> Good boy, Port Hole.
<s> Thank you, Dad.
<s> No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
<s> Houseboats don't go anywhere.
<s> It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
<s> -- who's married to --
<s> -- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
<s> My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
<s> And then I'll see you in New York --
<s> You couldn't.
<s> At the top of the Empire State Building --
<s> There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
<s> "I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
<s> "I want to meet you..."
<s> You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
<s> No.
<s> I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
<s> Okay.
<s> A sense of humor.
<s> You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
<s> Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
<s> You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
<s> How amazing.
<s> Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
<s> Mom, we already...
<s> Like... clockwork.
<s> It's me?
<s> The cabinets have to be redone --
<s> The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
<s> And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
<s> You want me to talk to him?
<s> What is it?
<s> You think so?
<s> I don't get it.
<s> It's a spice rack.
<s> My feelings exactly.
<s> I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
<s> They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
<s> English muffin.  How do you do it?
<s> It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
<s> I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
<s> I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
<s> Who is Annie?
<s> Shut up.
<s> Goddammit, I am sick of this --
<s> If I didn't go.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
<s> I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
<s> I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
<s> No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
<s> I read the same article...
<s> No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
<s> There's nothing stopping you.
<s> Whose side are you on anyway?
<s> I don't make policy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> So? What does he want to do about 'em?
<s> They are singing for me.
<s> Got to talk to the brothers.
<s> I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
<s> I'm a fool.
<s> Antonio paid for it.
<s> It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
<s> He was born fighting. And born hungry.
<s> No.
<s> She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm going back tomorrow.
<s> No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
<s> All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
<s> Hunting.
<s> Why not? I'm not needed here.
<s> Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
<s> Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
<s> Shut up, you're talking crazy.
<s> But honey ...
<s> You mean Delaware?
<s> New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
<s> Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
<s> Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
<s> You've got to help around the house!
<s> You should have helped her without being asked.
<s> Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
<s> What attitude?
<s> I was talking to my wife.
<s> Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
<s> Come on.  Ease off the girl.
<s> You like that?
<s> Now that's down-right insulting.
<s> Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
<s> Ouch.
<s> Colette ...
<s> Nothing.
<s> Then leave.
<s> Never heard of him.
<s> You really need to lighten up.
<s> Find a new job.
<s> Ass first into the world.
<s> I don't want to leave you.
<s> That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
<s> I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
<s> I know a guy.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
<s> The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> I think on account of his nose.
<s> He doesn't have one.
<s> No  You think she's a tweaker?
<s> John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
<s> Yes, Jimmy
<s> Yes, Jimmy.
<s> Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
<s> You aren't coming with me.
<s> Wait till I tell you what it is.
<s> I'm sorry. I couldn't.
<s> That was my idea.
<s> Understand what?
<s> Make me an offer.
<s> Pull your pants down.
<s> Pull your motherfucking pants down.
<s> Please .. I don't know what you're ...
<s> I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
<s> I'll keep that in mind.
<s> Just some buddies.
<s> Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
<s> Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
<s> Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
<s> Tell me what?
<s> Question is, what are you doing here?
<s> Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
<s> This chink have a name?
<s> For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
<s> Whata you mean?  He told me -
<s> Jesus.
<s> Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
<s> Who the hell is Jimmy?
<s> And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
<s> Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
<s> Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
<s> With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
<s> And you've got wiener breath.
<s> There's no motels around here.
<s> Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
<s> Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
<s> Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> You writin' a book or somethin'?
<s> Figured.
<s> In West Fork?
<s> No kidding.
<s> So they travel around from place to place and preach?
<s> The Army gave you that?
<s> Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
<s> Shut up, will you?
<s> Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
<s> Of course, sir.
<s> Like hell, you did.
<s> What deal?
<s> Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
<s> They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
<s> Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
<s> Keep trying.
<s> That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
<s> Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
<s> Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
<s> I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
<s> I changed my mind.
<s> Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
<s> Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
<s> Is it getting worse?
<s> How about you shut up and take your position?
<s> Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
<s> I know.
<s> Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
<s> Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
<s> There's always a bright side.
<s> I don't like that one.
<s> But we accomplish the mission.
<s> That's a mystery to me.
<s> Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
<s> ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
<s> You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
<s> More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
<s> Alright, come with me.
<s> I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
<s> What are we likely to run into?
<s> We know.
<s> What about you, Captain?
<s> Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
<s> Who knows?  It worked.
<s> Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
<s> Understanding the following rights...
<s> Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
<s> What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
<s> That's right.
<s> Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
<s> For going to school?
<s> Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
<s> Lloyd.
<s> Come on, it's graduation.
<s> He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
<s> What?  I'm sorry, talk.
<s> I just saw Joe.  He's here.
<s> Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
<s> Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
<s> Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
<s> You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
<s> We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
<s> No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
<s> I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
<s> Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
<s> You're going.
<s> Bon voyage.
<s> Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
<s> What am I supposed to think?
<s> I'm so ashamed dad.
<s> Hi.
<s> Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
<s> No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
<s> They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Bye.
<s> So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
<s> Today is tomorrow.
<s> I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm doing alright.
<s> Oh.  I was putting the...
<s> Yes.  Are you shaking?
<s> No, we don't have to say it.
<s> How can I look at you and say this?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> We decided...
<s> No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
<s> Just my dad.
<s> My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
<s> I love you.
<s> I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
<s> Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
<s> You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
<s> He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
<s> Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
<s> No.
<s> Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
<s> Yeah.  Honey?
<s> Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
<s> I'm totally and completely serious.
<s> Very talented.
<s> It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
<s> Dude, I can't do it!
<s> A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
<s> Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
<s> You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
<s> I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
<s> He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
<s> Sir, the list is correct.
<s> A charade?  How could it be a charade?
<s> It's good business.
<s> I just told you.
<s> The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
<s> Yeah, I can.
<s> There's nothing in the stores.
<s> Wine?
<s> Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
<s> Yes.
<s> And killing.
<s> There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
<s> More.
<s> No?
<s> No, no, what, what is it?
<s> He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
<s> There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
<s> Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
<s> Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
<s> Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
<s> What is it?
<s> Someone who wants to talk to you.
<s> Where is everybody?
<s> I had to change. Did anyone call?
<s> Can we talk?
<s> Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
<s> You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
<s> What?
<s> Please, Cotton, dont do this.
<s> Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
<s> I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Finish what my son started.
<s> Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
<s> I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
<s> I'll get my jacket.
<s> I think it's out of your control.
<s> Let us decide that.
<s> But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
<s> What guy?
<s> I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
<s> Until now.
<s> And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
<s> I think you're all an act.
<s> I know that.
<s> Meaning?
<s> Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
<s> C'mon. Let's go.
<s> I'll give you one guess.
<s> What if your life depended on it?
<s> It's what you want from me.
<s> I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
<s> Where is your attacker?
<s> I have to watch rehearsal.
<s> Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
<s> Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
<s> Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
<s> Thanks, Joel.
<s> Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
<s> Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
<s> What's your favorite scary movie?
<s> Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
<s> We got free tickets.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
<s> I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
<s> I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
<s> And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
<s> Do I?
<s> Thanks.
<s> You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
<s> Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
<s> Good bye Ben.
<s> Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
<s> Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
<s> Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
<s> There's more.
<s> I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
<s> Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
<s> Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
<s> To me Hollywood is about death.
<s> Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
<s> When it's a threat, you'll know it.
<s> The killer called her.
<s> And what made you think it was Sidney?
<s> I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
<s> Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
<s> Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
<s> You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
<s> Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
<s> But you know who she was.
<s> Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
<s> Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
<s> What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
<s> I am Gale Weathers!
<s> Gale Weathers would find a way. 
<s> Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
<s> Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
<s> Oh come on! Why the hostility?
<s> Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
<s> Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
<s> Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
<s> I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
<s> This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
<s> I'm hanging up right now.
<s> And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
<s> SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
<s> Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
<s> No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
<s> Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
<s> Who is this?
<s> I'll call you, when you're on your way.
<s> You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
<s> It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
<s> Well then the people you need to call are the police.
<s> I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
<s> And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
<s> No, it's not.
<s> She looked dead. Still does.
<s> I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
<s> I'll only stay a sec.
<s> Now that it's out of your system.
<s> Hey, hey, it's just me.
<s> See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
<s> It's okay. We need to talk.
<s> Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
<s> I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
<s> Stop it!
<s> Do I?
<s> I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
<s> So, you gotta boyfriend?
<s> Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
<s> What do you think I said?
<s> They'd never make it in time.
<s> Sure...
<s> Guess.
<s> I'll even give you a warm up question.
<s> YES!
<s> Answer the question and I will.
<s> Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
<s> Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
<s> What kind of lead?
<s> She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
<s> I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
<s> You want to go live?
<s> Yes, that's right.
<s> And why is that?
<s> No you didn't.
<s> Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
<s> You got it.
<s> Before she dumped him for Steve.
<s> We had a run in the mass murder section.
<s> Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
<s> He came to make up.
<s> No, Sid.
<s> The official term is "psychotic".
<s> They think it's school-related?
<s> How do you gut someone?
<s> I'll be there by seven. I promise
<s> Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
<s> With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
<s> During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
<s> Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
<s> Deal.
<s> I don't know, they just did.
<s> That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
<s> For once, Stu, drop it.
<s> Give it to me.
<s> There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
<s> Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
<s> Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
<s> I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
<s> I heard.
<s> We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
<s> Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
<s> Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
<s> I seem to remember knocking on your door.
<s> It's close.
<s> Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
<s> What?
<s> Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
<s> Nothing.
<s> Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
<s> It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
<s> No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
<s> They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
<s> A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
<s> Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
<s> What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
<s> I don't.  Neither do you.
<s> We're focusing.
<s> Then, he must write about these murders.
<s> Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
<s> He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
<s> Kiss me on the lips.
<s> What are you talking about?  What happened?
<s> Oh... um, William.
<s> No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
<s> Too long.  What do you think so far?
<s> You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
<s> Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
<s> I want to have children.  It's just...
<s> This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
<s> You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
<s> An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
<s> Huh...? No...no water.
<s> This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
<s> Captain Clayton...Captain!
<s> Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
<s> God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
<s> All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
<s> Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
<s> They have done...nothing...They are my people...
<s> I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
<s> SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
<s> Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
<s> In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
<s> That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
<s> YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
<s> Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
<s> He just couldn't wait...
<s> Think it might be...?
<s> Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
<s> How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
<s> Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
<s> I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
<s> Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
<s> They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
<s> There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
<s> I got your boy killed.
<s> You've seen her!...She's alive?
<s> Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
<s> That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
<s> A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
<s> Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
<s> Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
<s> You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
<s> <U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
<s> You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
<s> Oh God, Tommi...
<s> So do I, believe me.
<s> Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
<s> Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
<s> I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
<s> We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
<s> ...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
<s> But what is the truth?
<s> I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
<s> A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
<s> I've killed my husband!
<s> Just call me Elisabeth.
<s> Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
<s> Tenth floor.
<s> And the title of this piece?
<s> The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
<s> No Juliet?!
<s> I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
<s> A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
<s> She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
<s> Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
<s> Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
<s> I don't know. It's a mystery.
<s> Very well.
<s> As soon as I have found my muse
<s> Who wrote that?
<s> Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
<s> Is it about a pirate's daughter?
<s> Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
<s> We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
<s> We are about to embark on a great voyage.
<s> How will it?
<s> I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
<s> Do you think?
<s> I thought your play was for Burbage.
<s> "Not having that which, having, makes them short."
<s> When the Queen commands it.
<s> Be still.
<s> All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
<s> Stand up straight, girl.
<s> Your Majesty
<s> And I love poetry above all.
<s> Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
<s> I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
<s> Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
<s> "Ay me."
<s> Is she obedient?
<s> I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
<s> Who is there?
<s> The same, alas.
<s> A lowly player.
<s> If they find you here they will kill you.
<s> Can you love a player?
<s> Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
<s> No, the morning rooster woke me.
<s> Mr. Henslowe?
<s> Yes, some of it is speakable.
<s> That's my line!
<s> Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
<s> You cannot marry Wessex!
<s> So my lord? I speak with him every day.
<s> Do you intend to marry, my lord?
<s> It is to be expected on a Sunday.
<s> Of course you have not! I have not written it!
<s> Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
<s> It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
<s> I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
<s> Are you bringing your laundry woman?
<s> Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
<s> Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
<s> About what?
<s> Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
<s> Dig the pit, I don't know.
<s> Just stop worrying.
<s> I want to talk now.
<s> Now.
<s> You think so?
<s> I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
<s> Not eating like you used to, that's what.
<s> Your friends.
<s> It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
<s> They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
<s> I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
<s> Cover it?
<s> And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> Cameron?
<s> I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
<s> OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
<s> For the flat.
<s> He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
<s> I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
<s> No. Any idea which channel he's on?
<s> But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
<s> Oh, shut up, Alex.
<s> That's what I thought he said.
<s> No.
<s> Let him go. Let him take it all.
<s> What about?
<s> Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
<s> Who said there were four?
<s> No, three. Who said there were four?
<s> Yes, absolutely.
<s> Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
<s> Someone lost the key.
<s> That wasn't a question.
<s> That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> What happened to that guy?
<s> Would you like to see the rest?
<s> And that's not the same thing?
<s> Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
<s> One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
<s> Yeah, baby, how's it going?
<s> Look, would you argue with your doctor?
<s> I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
<s> Lester, don't you think that uhh --
<s> Yes, sweetheart, shh.
<s> -- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
<s> No.
<s> Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
<s> That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
<s> It turned out to be cancer.
<s> I gotta talk to you.
<s> What?
<s> I don't want to place you in any position --
<s> You're looking great, baby.
<s> The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
<s> I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
<s> She's a friend of Jill's.
<s> I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ... yeah.
<s> I am not like my mother!
<s> Right, that's right.
<s> Buffums?
<s> I've got heads here, Norman.
<s> Oh fuck, Norman!
<s> No, I'm sure.
<s> Yeah... I mean great.
<s> It's hot in here.
<s> Why not?
<s> ... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
<s> Did Lester know about him?
<s> Hey, I don't tell.
<s> You did, didn't you?
<s> You did, I know you did.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> -- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
<s> -- this guy with Jill.
<s> Jackie, can we --
<s> -- what?
<s> -- oh I thought you were --
<s> Lester's on his way.
<s> I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
<s> If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
<s> What?
<s> She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
<s> She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
<s> -- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
<s> -- Oh my yes.
<s> I don't know if you don't know --
<s> -- c'mon, I'll get you home...
<s> That's too bad.
<s> I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
<s> What're you talking about?
<s> Who?
<s> I am?
<s> -- Sure.
<s> I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
<s> I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
<s> Egypt!
<s> Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
<s> A business meeting, I told you that.
<s> What is.
<s> Yes.
<s> Where did this come from?
<s> I just want to know, that's all.
<s> I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
<s> -- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
<s> Yeah, I know. Did you?
<s> Did you?
<s> What did you say?
<s> No?
<s> In a way. But...
<s> Oh yeah? I mean I know.
<s> Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
<s> It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
<s> Isn't that bad for it?
<s> Well... who are those guys?
<s> I'm not anti-Establishment.
<s> No thanks.
<s> What about her?
<s> Yes I do.
<s> What?
<s> I... uh... I... uh... can't.
<s> What was it, somebody's daughter?
<s> -- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Is that right?
<s> George is going to open a shop.
<s> What's that?
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.
<s> They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
<s> Aren't you going to have one?
<s> Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
<s> I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
<s> So what's your point?
<s> -- No. No really.
<s> Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
<s> -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
<s> Jackie --
<s> -- sort of a boyfriend?
<s> I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
<s> -- these bastards have me hemmed in.
<s> Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
<s> No... how long did you say?
<s> No, it's not that...
<s> No.
<s> -- we're going to be here all night.
<s> I am, Dad.  Dad?
<s> No, Dad.
<s> Tony.
<s> Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
<s> Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
<s> Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
<s> No.
<s> Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
<s> I won't, Mom.
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> Are you having a bad dream?
<s> Danny, come here!
<s> Do I have to?
<s> Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
<s> Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
<s> Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
<s> He is, Mr. Torrance.
<s> Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
<s> Grady... oh.
<s> Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
<s> I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
<s> Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
<s> It's good to be back, Lloyd.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
<s> It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why?
<s> Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
<s> Stop swinging the bat.
<s> Wendy give me the bat.
<s> Give me the bat.
<s> Give me the bat.
<s> Go away.
<s> Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
<s> Well, that sounds fine to me.
<s> I'm intrigued.
<s> shut in together over long periods of time.
<s> How do you do?
<s> Sure, Uncle Al.
<s> What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
<s> What?
<s> What kind of noises?
<s> Do I need one?
<s> Yeah... sure.
<s> You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
<s> I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
<s> I told you!
<s> And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
<s> The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
<s> We won't!
<s> BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
<s> Were you tempted?
<s> And you listen to that?
<s> Today was the deadline, Vince.
<s> Yes, Betty?
<s> What is it, Betty?
<s> Yes, Betty?
<s> Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
<s> It's true -- I know her.
<s> What a shame!
<s> Were you wicked?
<s> Um, I don't really know this one...
<s> That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
<s> An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
<s> Three years.  Sister.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
<s> Give me a C.  A C!
<s> What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
<s> Enough joking.
<s> What's a concubine?
<s> Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
<s> I'm outta here.
<s> A what?
<s> A what?
<s> My what?
<s> Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
<s> What?
<s> And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
<s> You have a phone call.
<s> Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
<s> Saving you.  Move!
<s> Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
<s> Then-you run.
<s> You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
<s> Maybe Hawaii.
<s> Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
<s> Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
<s> I think they'd understand.
<s> Even nuns have to pee.
<s> Not... totally.
<s> So, take it off.
<s> Maybe pants.
<s> Willy -- hit the lights.
<s> That's what I figured, too.
<s> That should have tipped us.
<s> We can't leave it up to the Feds!
<s> Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
<s> It's brought people back to the church.
<s> We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
<s> Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
<s> She's our inspiration!
<s> And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
<s> I know. 
<s> And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
<s> I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
<s> She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
<s> Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
<s> Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
<s> Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> What are you spying on?
<s> ... Brom Bones...
<s> What?
<s> I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
<s> Protest to my superiors if you like.
<s> Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
<s> Pardon me?
<s> Master Hardenbrook...
<s> Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
<s> Not for lack of trying.
<s> Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
<s> I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
<s> I'm sure I don't know.
<s> Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
<s> I have others.  All I need is this.
<s> Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
<s> You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
<s> We should go.
<s> But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
<s> In test... what?
<s> Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
<s> Lady Van Tassel.
<s> It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
<s> Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
<s> You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
<s> Lady Van Tassel...
<s> Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
<s> There is no such thing as magic.
<s> To avenge his father, and the others.
<s> What?
<s> She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
<s> He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
<s> Yes, actually.
<s> She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
<s> Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
<s> Let her go!
<s> Yes.  Here...
<s> If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
<s> You got any money?
<s> Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
<s> No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
<s> He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
<s> Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
<s> How are you, Bill?
<s> I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
<s> What you got that's good to eat?
<s> I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
<s> It's too big.
<s> You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
<s> Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
<s> What?
<s> Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
<s> But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
<s> What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
<s> Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
<s> Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
<s> Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
<s> Childers.
<s> You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
<s> I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
<s> They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
<s> I reckon I feel all right.
<s> Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
<s> I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
<s> He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
<s> You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
<s> Why did he do that, reckon.
<s> Yeah, I did.
<s> I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
<s> Yeah.
<s> All right then.
<s> All right then.
<s> If you want me to.
<s> Naw.
<s> That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
<s> You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
<s> Naw.
<s> My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
<s> A little ol' boy.
<s> Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
<s> Is that right?
<s> You will? For sure?
<s> No sir.
<s> I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
<s> If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
<s> Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
<s> I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
<s> That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
<s> You don't want to give away all your books.
<s> I've got a feelin' today.
<s> Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
<s> Okay.
<s> Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
<s> Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
<s> Me, too.
<s> I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
<s> I want to come back and stay here.
<s> I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
<s> Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
<s> I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
<s> I never was no good with history.
<s> I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
<s> He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
<s> That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
<s> Tolerable, I reckon.
<s> I'll be dog.
<s> No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
<s> Ma'am?
<s> You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
<s> So, you're really going to stay here?
<s> I wouldn't never hurt them.
<s> Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
<s> In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
<s> Why won't he talk to women?
<s> No thank you.
<s> Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
<s> I knew he slept in a toolshed.
<s> Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
<s> Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
<s> Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> Actually, I'm his father.
<s> Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
<s> It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
<s> Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
<s> Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
<s> I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
<s> Yeah, I did.
<s> It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
<s> You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
<s> Uh, better make it one.
<s> Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
<s> Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
<s> Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
<s> Yeah, probably.
<s> I mean, it's a good story.
<s> Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
<s> It means "happiness."
<s> Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
<s> Yeah, like what?
<s> Why don't you open it and find out?
<s> I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
<s> It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
<s> Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
<s> And why the hell would you give me money?
<s> Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
<s> Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
<s> And you told your nephew about it?
<s> And?
<s> You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
<s> It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
<s> I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
<s> It was just a thought.
<s> You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
<s> Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
<s> That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
<s> And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
<s> Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
<s> I mean breakfast.
<s> But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
<s> Is your father an artist?
<s> What time is it?
<s> Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
<s> It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
<s> No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
<s> Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
<s> Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
<s> Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
<s> Absolutely. We would be honored.
<s> Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
<s> Yeah, I picked it up.
<s> I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
<s> I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
<s> Now ask him who his mother was.
<s> Yes, please.
<s> Yes, please.
<s> Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
<s> No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
<s> Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
<s> I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
<s> Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
<s> You done your math right.
<s> Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
<s> It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
<s> Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
<s> So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
<s> Why not?
<s> Well, it seems to me...
<s> I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
<s> I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
<s> Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
<s> ...but he found you.
<s> And the last...?
<s> Pretty darn clear.
<s> He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
<s> All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
<s> Objection!
<s> Twelve.
<s> Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
<s> No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
<s> Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
<s> Three kids.  What's she going to do?
<s> Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
<s> Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
<s> It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
<s> Naw, I had that around for a while.
<s> Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
<s> You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
<s> It is.
<s> No.
<s> She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
<s> The same.
<s> Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
<s> He had no reason to.
<s> As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
<s> I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
<s> Yes.  And that one, too.
<s> Bye.
<s> Bull fiddle.
<s> Fresh!
<s> Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
<s> 
<s> A what?
<s> Those two musicians from the garage!
<s> I'll say.
<s> Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
<s> Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
<s> Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
<s> I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
<s> No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
<s> We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
<s> With those legs?  Are you crazy?
<s> What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
<s> I'm Josephine.  Sax.
<s> Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
<s> Fight it.
<s> And I'm not even pretty.
<s> I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
<s> We can get a job with another band. A male band.
<s> Don't get burned, Daphne.
<s> Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
<s> Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
<s> Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
<s> No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
<s> Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
<s> Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
<s> We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
<s> Like right after the ceremony.
<s> Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
<s> Daphne got a proposal tonight.
<s> Get me Room 414.
<s> We're not on the pier yet -
<s> I'll say.
<s> I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
<s> If there's anything I can do for you -
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> You got some?
<s> I may spill something.
<s> A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
<s> She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
<s> Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
<s> Come on, Daphne.
<s> I guess she's not in here.
<s> Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
<s> I met one of them.
<s> I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
<s> Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
<s> Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
<s> - and you got to be girls.
<s> Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
<s> You invest in shows?
<s> You're not sure?
<s> I'm not surprised.
<s> Bull fiddle.
<s> Wanna bet?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
<s> But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
<s> It's not the backs that worry me.
<s> William Morris!
<s> All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
<s> If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
<s> I'm not very bright, I guess.
<s> Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
<s> Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
<s> I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
<s> Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
<s> I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
<s> My fault.
<s> Not very likely.
<s> Not at all.
<s> They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
<s> For your own amusement?
<s> You're society girls?
<s> Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
<s> I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
<s> It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
<s> It's been delightful meeting you both.
<s> If it's at all possible -
<s> Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
<s> Shells?  Whatever for?
<s> Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
<s> It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
<s> Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
<s> Oh - a member of the herring family.
<s> Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
<s> Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
<s> Oh, you couldn't possibly.
<s> If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
<s> Lets throw another log on the fire.
<s> Good morning.
<s> Did you have a nice time?
<s> Me?
<s> You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
<s> According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
<s> Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
<s> I come to the old lady's funeral.
<s> That's because I've been on the wagon.
<s> Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
<s> Booze.
<s> Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
<s> Big joke!
<s> Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
<s> Except its Scotch.
<s> When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
<s> So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
<s> Hey.
<s> Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
<s> She did?
<s> Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
<s> Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
<s> Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
<s> Sorry, can you give us a moment?
<s> Yeah?
<s> It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
<s> You have feet?
<s> Youre funny.
<s> Really?  Dont get too attached.
<s> Love.
<s> He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
<s> On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
<s> If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
<s> First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--
<s> What?!
<s> I guess so.
<s> This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
<s> Okay.
<s> Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
<s> Make out with you for free.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
<s> What?! No, no. You cant--
<s> You have more than one gynecologist?
<s> You knew?
<s> Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
<s> Uh huh...
<s> That's where we come from first?
<s> What's his name?
<s> It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
<s> Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
<s> You could? How?
<s> But where is my daddy!?
<s> Nothin'...
<s> She was dirty and wet...
<s> :HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
<s> :His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
<s> NO! N-O, NO!
<s> I did look, Charlie, but I--
<s> It was too dark, Daddy.
<s> Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
<s> Yes, sir...
<s> They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
<s> We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
<s> Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
<s> You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
<s> And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
<s> What's that, son?
<s> Nathan Lee Morgan...
<s> Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
<s> Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
<s> Then why don't he holler like he usta?
<s> I don't look like no possum!
<s> Thank you, Josie Mae.
<s> No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
<s> Good night...
<s> I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
<s> Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
<s> Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
<s> No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
<s> If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
<s> What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
<s> Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
<s> Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
<s> At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
<s> I brought these walnuts to trade.
<s> I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
<s> I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
<s> I wanta see Nathan.
<s> I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
<s> You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
<s> I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
<s> Will they give him a trial?
<s> I am the clitoris.
<s> There are more important matters right now...
<s> Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
<s> My head hurts.
<s> Doggy.
<s> Montana.
<s> -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
<s> I saw him last night!
<s> We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
<s> Sheet!
<s> Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
<s> Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
<s> Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
<s> 'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
<s> You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
<s> What?
<s> I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
<s> No way.
<s> Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
<s> MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
<s> Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
<s> Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
<s> I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
<s> Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
<s> Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
<s> Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
<s> HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
<s> This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
<s> Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
<s> Aw, ma!!
<s> Dude, what the hell is going on?
<s> Uhh... Bacon.
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
<s> For pooping, silly.
<s> No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
<s> YOU BASTARD!!
<s> How do we do that?
<s> What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
<s> I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
<s> Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
<s> -Or monkey fucker-
<s> Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
<s> Right away, ma'am!
<s> Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
<s> Oh.
<s> And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
<s> You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
<s> A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
<s> YOU'D fuck your uncle!
<s> I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
<s> You did? Just now?
<s> Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
<s> You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
<s> Hey, come here, guy.
<s> I am.
<s> Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
<s> You don't care.
<s> Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
<s> Don't call me dumb!
<s> I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
<s> Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
<s> Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
<s> Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
<s> Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
<s> Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
<s> THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
<s> That's nice, Stan.
<s> Hi Stan.
<s> And ze rope?
<s> I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
<s> Oh Sara...
<s> Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
<s> Very professional of you.
<s> I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
<s> The device has stopped responding.
<s> Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
<s> I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
<s> It's steady, good benefits.
<s> That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
<s> Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
<s> That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
<s> Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
<s> Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
<s> Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
<s> That's me.
<s> I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
<s> Like that piece of ass he was with.
<s> Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
<s> I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
<s> Just don't move around too much.
<s> Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
<s> Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why can't we?
<s> Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
<s> Close every door behind you!
<s> Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
<s> Sure.
<s> The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
<s> Why?  Where are you going?
<s> I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
<s> Taylor!  Where are you?
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> It would matter to us.
<s> Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
<s> He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
<s> Homesick?  It's only been two days!
<s> Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
<s> I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
<s> The engines!
<s> Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
<s> One moment please...  one moment please...
<s> I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
<s> It belonged to my dad.
<s> You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
<s> What do you want with old man Faz?
<s> I'd buy it!
<s> Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
<s> You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
<s> Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
<s> Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
<s> kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
<s> I couldn't care less.
<s> I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
<s> Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
<s> See ya 'round Maynard.
<s> Millie, I know what I'm doing.
<s> You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
<s> I found dad.
<s> I gotta go. Love ya mom.
<s> Buzz Fazeli.
<s> You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
<s> No!
<s> I like the sport the way it is.
<s> Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
<s> That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
<s> Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
<s> They suspended me.
<s> He's my father, Millie.
<s> Not while I'm in training.
<s> So, what about you?
<s> We'll get into that later.
<s> I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
<s> No, I'm fascinated.
<s> He said he'd sponsor me.
<s> Nothing.
<s> What's plan C?
<s> It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
<s> More than you could afford.
<s> I could let them go for ten.
<s> If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
<s> ...lane six. Yes.
<s> Nope, I couldn't care less.
<s> Why not?
<s> You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
<s> If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
<s> Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
<s> I am a professional man.
<s> You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
<s> I'm not here to bowl.
<s> I'm looking for somebody.
<s> The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
<s> How long will that be?
<s> Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
<s> Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
<s> What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
<s> The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
<s> They didn't tell me anything.
<s> Geologists?
<s> ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
<s> But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
<s> All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
<s> What do you mean, he's missing?
<s> They've left, keep watching!
<s> If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
<s> So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
<s> Please watch your closest monitor...
<s> She's not gonna know, sir.
<s> Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
<s> What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
<s> Sir, about leaving --
<s> I love secrets.
<s> What -- are you threatening me?
<s> A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
<s> Yeah, why?
<s> You went through Edmunds' things?
<s> What?
<s> Don't bother me, Norman.
<s> We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
<s> Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
<s> I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
<s> What?
<s> Squids?
<s> What?
<s> You think, in the sphere --
<s> But why is he doing it?
<s> His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
<s> Tarazine?
<s> Antihistamine.  For bites.
<s> Antibiotic.
<s> Causes sleep.
<s> How fast does it take effect?
<s> Where are you?
<s> I'm feeling better.
<s> What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
<s> No, he can't.
<s> But I have to, Norman.
<s> Get away from the door, Beth.
<s> Don't fuck with me, Beth.
<s> Who says it's a he?
<s> It's an American spacecraft.
<s> Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
<s> We can refuse to talk.
<s> What?
<s> Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
<s> Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
<s> What are you still doing here?
<s> What is it, Harry?
<s> What happened to her?
<s> Wisconsin?
<s> Stop what?  What are you -- ?
<s> Shut up and open the door.
<s> Hold on.
<s> I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
<s> No idea.
<s> Nine hundred feet to surface.
<s> We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
<s> Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
<s> Meaning?
<s> The others, sir?
<s> No, they didn't say --
<s> Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
<s> Geologists?  At a plane crash?
<s> What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
<s> He's a pussy.
<s> Please, Ted.
<s> Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
<s> I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
<s> Fear is their greatest weapon.
<s> All right then, we'll use your plan.
<s> There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
<s> Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
<s> I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
<s> But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
<s> Could I learn to feel it?
<s> Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
<s> These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
<s> You mean we should go after her!...
<s> Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
<s> I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
<s> Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
<s> Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
<s> That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
<s> You don't believe in the Force?
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
<s> Why didn't you say so before.
<s> Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
<s> Come back here... Where are you going?
<s> They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
<s> Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
<s> I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
<s> I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
<s> Are you there, sir?  We're going...
<s> Yes, sir !
<s> Sir... I guess I do, sir.
<s> Your father will never let you.
<s> I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
<s> I'm getting better.
<s> Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
<s> Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
<s> Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
<s> I don't know, Zander.
<s> It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
<s> I don't want everyone to see.
<s> It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
<s> Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
<s> How do I know if this is love ?
<s> Good luck at the academy.
<s> I can't help it.
<s> I don't even know if you're my girl.
<s> Who cares ?
<s> Shhh...
<s> Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
<s> Did you get Starside R&D ?
<s> Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
<s> I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
<s> Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
<s> Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
<s> Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
<s> Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
<s> Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
<s> How come we never got together ?
<s> Sure.
<s> High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
<s> Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
<s> All bands.
<s> Teenagers !
<s> Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
<s> I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
<s> Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
<s> Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
<s> I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
<s> You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
<s> Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
<s> Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
<s> Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
<s> That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
<s> Who is V'ger?
<s> Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
<s> By the Creator.
<s> It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
<s> Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
<s> They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
<s> Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
<s> Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
<s> Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
<s> Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
<s> That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
<s> Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
<s> Twelve seconds...!
<s> Ten seconds....
<s> Opinion, Mister. Spock?
<s> Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
<s> Sit down, please.
<s> I want him here.  Sit down!
<s> Mr. Decker... ?
<s> I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
<s> No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
<s> Precisely.
<s> No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
<s> Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
<s> Tractor beam remains constant...
<s> Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
<s> I'll be there.
<s> You bet your life.
<s> You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
<s> N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
<s> It's about a man who gets a second chance.
<s> That's true.  You grow up here?
<s> Yes...
<s> I understand...
<s> As the Old Mill goes around...
<s> And likewise.
<s> No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
<s> That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
<s> What are you doing?  I love your script.
<s> It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<s> But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
<s> He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
<s> ...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
<s> They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
<s> What?
<s> Better idea...
<s> "Room Service!"
<s> Read the card.
<s> Then I'll come back, then.
<s> Because I'd met someone else.
<s> It used to be the Old Mill.
<s> I hurt you?
<s> She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
<s> That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
<s> Is it...
<s> I'd love to.
<s> You'd do the newspaper right here.
<s> Sleep well?
<s> Not without a rolltop desk.
<s> Happen to know where there's one for sale.
<s> I'm going to tell the truth.
<s> If I go to jail...?
<s> Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
<s> Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
<s> That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
<s> Well, then, what's he doing here?
<s> Hi.
<s> Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
<s> It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
<s> I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
<s> And I need a drink.
<s> Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
<s> What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
<s> ...you got to get me that street for nothing...
<s> ...they run on water.
<s> On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
<s> I'm having dinner with W...
<s> Bourbon and Milk.
<s> You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
<s> Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
<s> We've got three days to...
<s> I'm ready!
<s> I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
<s> You have to what?
<s> Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
<s> The Mayor's outside.
<s> I think he's moved...
<s> He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
<s> I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
<s> Why?
<s> How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
<s> Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
<s> Yes, yes, but...
<s> It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
<s> I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
<s> Is...Is the Movie!
<s> ...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
<s> ...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
<s> We, we have to give it.
<s> I...
<s> The minute I read that script I said...
<s> I can't tell.
<s> Well.
<s> Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
<s> What is the...?
<s> You were in the car with Bob?
<s> You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
<s> Later for you, pal.
<s> ...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
<s> Gut Yuntif.
<s> A witness to what...?
<s> I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
<s> You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
<s> I have to talk to you.  My wife...
<s> I can only write on a manual.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't know.
<s> What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
<s> They're coming Fedex...
<s> 55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
<s> That's what I said.
<s> That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
<s> Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
<s> Is that one hell of a kid?
<s> He's got a gift for fiction.
<s> Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
<s> You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
<s> I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
<s> Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
<s> So we just got lucky.
<s> I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
<s> No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
<s> Mmm...
<s> Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
<s> Givvem a cigarette...
<s> Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
<s> I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
<s> Mommy's marrying Rache!
<s> I don't care.
<s> I hate when you say that.
<s> Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
<s> Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
<s> Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
<s> Then why are you putting on mascara?
<s> Or blush.  You look pale.
<s> No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
<s> Well.  It's for you.
<s> Secret's safe with me.
<s> Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
<s> ...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
<s> Oh, yeh.
<s> I'm not.
<s> Yes.
<s> Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
<s> He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
<s> Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
<s> I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
<s> I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
<s> That's so weak.
<s> You think this is funny?
<s> Suits me <u>fine</u>!
<s> ...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
<s> Not use my words, please!
<s> You owe me a quarter.
<s> Then have a donut --
<s> Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
<s> IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
<s> I have lava.
<s> No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
<s> What honey?
<s> Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
<s> I'm still sick, but I'm better.
<s> No!  I have to get there.
<s> Oh.
<s> I helped.
<s> Rache can do that part.
<s> So where are you?
<s> Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
<s> Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
<s> Every day.  More and more.
<s> Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
<s> Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
<s> No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
<s> Remarried.  There is no move.
<s> They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
<s> You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
<s> Easy enough.
<s> You're WHERE?
<s> <u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
<s> Just not to me.
<s> Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
<s> I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
<s> No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
<s> But it's not on the schedule!
<s> Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
<s> I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
<s> Anxiety.
<s> Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
<s> You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
<s> You're not dying.
<s> You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
<s> She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
<s> Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
<s> You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
<s> No.
<s> Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
<s> Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
<s> Aw.
<s> That's not wh...
<s> Oh please.
<s> Double.
<s> I lost him.  I was panicked.
<s> You're the hip and fresh.
<s> For what?
<s> They don't hate you --
<s> Nobody's telling them to hate you --
<s> Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
<s> No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
<s> How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
<s> What?
<s> Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
<s> What?
<s> But I thought he came over to America before the war.
<s> Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Great to be here.
<s> Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
<s> Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
<s> Yes, Mikey?
<s> Four brothers and five sisters.
<s> It was God's will.
<s> No, Mikey.
<s> My Jesus
<s> My baby.
<s> He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
<s> Poison gas.
<s> He wasn't.
<s> You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
<s> Yes, I do. I love them!
<s> Nothing, I guess
<s> You started filling out your college applications yet?
<s> Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
<s> I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
<s> You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
<s> Don't be so upset. It's OK...
<s> Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
<s> Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
<s> You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
<s> ...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
<s> Man, it's just, like, conversation.
<s> Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
<s> I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
<s> ...gger.
<s> Again!!
<s> Great!
<s> That's what I was gonna ask you.
<s> Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
<s> Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
<s> HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
<s> He did?
<s> Well get someone down there!
<s> I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
<s> If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
<s> We don't have time!
<s> What happened!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
<s> Even better.
<s> It's nothing to worry about.
<s> Where does it lead?
<s> He's in there...
<s> I'll let the senator tell you.
<s> You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
<s> I say we head out.
<s> Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
<s> Dissent?
<s> Certainly - how about some breakfast?
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
<s> The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
<s> Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
<s> Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
<s> You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
<s> The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
<s> Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
<s> Didn't they tell you?
<s> Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
<s> Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
<s> He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
<s> What is your name, young lady?
<s> What did you say?
<s> Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
<s> General Schmuck?
<s> I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
<s> What kind of trouble?
<s> Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
<s> I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
<s> But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
<s> This is General Ripper speaking.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
<s> And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
<s> If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
<s> Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
<s> You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
<s> Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
<s> But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
<s> Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
<s> That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
<s> Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
<s> General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
<s> Why can't you cancel it?
<s> That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
<s> General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
<s> Naturally I am, sir.
<s> Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
<s> If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
<s> Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
<s> Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
<s> Lothar, take your checks now.
<s> Maybe it's an exercise.
<s> Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
<s> Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
<s> Maximum ECM!
<s> Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
<s> Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
<s> Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
<s> Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
<s> Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
<s> I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
<s> Look, this is different.
<s> But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
<s> Take it easy, Major Kong.
<s> Sorry, King.
<s> Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
<s> But I get a red light.
<s> But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
<s> Roger.
<s> Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
<s> Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
<s> Knock yourself out.
<s> Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Was it okay?
<s> What did you guys think?
<s> Yes.
<s> Hey, you said you did a video?
<s> What's it about?
<s> I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
<s> Needs some pizza in his diet.
<s> And your mom.
<s> Where are you-hoo?
<s> Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
<s> No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes!
<s> So you can do an album cover?
<s> No, I'm not worried.
<s> Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
<s> No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
<s> No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
<s> Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
<s> Buff...
<s> No, no, no.
<s> Oh, really? You wanna go look?
<s> Guess not.
<s> Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
<s> Jeff! Let's go!
<s> Come on.
<s> Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
<s> Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
<s> Hey.
<s> Sure I am. It's fun.
<s> Well, that's one way of putting it.
<s> Alright, Pony!
<s> I'm so burnt-out.
<s> Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
<s> Glad it's okay.
<s> You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
<s> Oh, thanks. Thanks.
<s> Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
<s> See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
<s> No, no, whoa!
<s> Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
<s> I could.
<s> Yes!
<s> A reel?
<s> I'll be in the car, okay?
<s> Okay. We'll go for a ride.
<s> Mm.
<s> Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
<s> He's drunk.
<s> Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
<s> Because I'm alienated.
<s> Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
<s> No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
<s> Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
<s> You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
<s> Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
<s> Good, good. I, I hope he does.
<s> You don't know?
<s> He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
<s> I don't want to hear it anymore.
<s> Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
<s> So you can give me more shit?
<s> I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
<s> About what?
<s> ... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
<s> No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Mm-mm.
<s> Mm.
<s> You do.
<s> No. No, no, no.
<s> I, yeah.
<s> Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
<s> Shit, Jeff!
<s> Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
<s> Oh, fuck it, man!
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
<s> What?
<s> You know what I'm saying?
<s> Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
<s> Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
<s> Well, what about this?
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> It's pretty exciting.
<s> Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
<s> Yep.
<s> Yeah?
<s> She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Don't do that, man, okay?
<s> Don't do that.
<s> If you hit me...
<s> It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
<s> At least I have a point of view, you know?
<s> Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
<s> Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
<s> You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
<s> I just pulled and it - it came off.
<s> Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
<s> Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
<s> Wayne Gretzky.
<s> Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
<s> My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
<s> Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
<s> Bye.
<s> Of course - of course!  Hands in...
<s> Y'think?
<s> Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
<s> Mmm-hmmm...
<s> What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
<s> I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
<s> We were told you could "fix us up."
<s> Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
<s> For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
<s> Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
<s> Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
<s> Bullets.
<s> I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
<s> Oh yeah, you caught us...
<s> Definitely old.
<s> Maybe we can make a deal.
<s> So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
<s> Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
<s> Stop it!  This is crazy!
<s> I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
<s> Close, but no cigar.
<s> I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
<s> That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
<s> Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
<s> Sorry if I crossed you up.
<s> So long.
<s> Why should you do that?
<s> I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
<s> Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
<s> Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
<s> Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
<s> Who's who?
<s> Twenty-two.
<s> You did.
<s> I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
<s> I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
<s> No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
<s> Joe, I can't look at you any more.
<s> Hello, Mr. deMille.
<s> That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
<s> It's a good script, isn't it?
<s> I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
<s> Why?
<s> Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> This is fascinating.
<s> I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
<s> Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
<s> Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
<s> Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
<s> What's wrong with It?
<s> Come here!
<s> I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
<s> There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
<s> Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
<s> A little.
<s> Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
<s> What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
<s> It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
<s> Good night.
<s> Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
<s> You think I made that up about the gun...
<s> No, they don't.
<s> Good.
<s> The doctor suggested it.
<s> I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
<s> I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
<s> Right with you.
<s> What car?
<s> Is that So?
<s> Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
<s> It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
<s> Frankly, no.
<s> Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> No?
<s> Maybe what you need is another agent.
<s> If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
<s> Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
<s> How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
<s> It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
<s> The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
<s> But which one?
<s> Sorry, mistress.
<s> It's what we were warned about.
<s> No, a super girl.
<s> I've been saving it. For the right moment.
<s> She didn't take it from you, did she?
<s> It's for your own protection.
<s> Yes. It reminds me of home.
<s> It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
<s> Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
<s> Miss what?
<s> And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
<s> You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
<s> Yes.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> And you think you're in love.
<s> I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
<s> You vicious--
<s> I don't know. You seem afraid.
<s> Well...I guess I can't.
<s> Theories?
<s> The scoop of the year!
<s> Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
<s> But what for?
<s> It was just a trim.
<s> It doesn't seem right.
<s> I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
<s> Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
<s> No, MR. Danvers.
<s> I'd love to.
<s> You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
<s> I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
<s> You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
<s> Not yet.
<s> ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
<s> Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
<s> I knew it!
<s> Why?
<s> Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
<s> It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
<s> Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
<s> Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
<s> No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
<s> I seem to be.
<s> The kid needs a man to show him --
<s> You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
<s> And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
<s> The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
<s> Who?
<s> Oh...I came close once.
<s> You thought that?
<s> Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
<s> I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
<s> I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
<s> Can I help?
<s> Me too. That's why I put this one up.
<s> But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
<s> Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
<s> Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
<s> Oh. You're going away.
<s> Say!
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
<s> First paycheck?
<s> Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
<s> Yeah. A raise . .
<s> Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
<s> Or socks.
<s> Just the man I wanted to see!
<s> God, that's what I keep you for.
<s> Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
<s> KRYPTONITE!
<s> We've already got some.
<s> Exactly. Stoned mother.
<s> Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
<s> Watch out for them air pockets!
<s> We gonna crash?
<s> Just a second.
<s> Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
<s> You just did, with that great dinner.
<s> Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
<s> The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
<s> Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
<s> Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
<s> Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
<s> How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
<s> We can get to work on that oil!
<s> Don't bet on it!
<s> Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
<s> Do I detect a note of jealousy?
<s> Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
<s> Be my guest.
<s> Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
<s> I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
<s> Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
<s> Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
<s> Lois, I really don't see why --
<s> Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
<s> That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
<s> It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
<s> How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
<s> Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
<s> Yes.
<s> Now This I want to hear.
<s> My kind of people.
<s> I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
<s> The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
<s> Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
<s> Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
<s> Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
<s> Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
<s> Cuba.
<s> Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
<s> Put down Lex Luthor?
<s> Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
<s> Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
<s> And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
<s> Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
<s> This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
<s> If you say so. Here goes.
<s> Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
<s> I'm not so sure you do.
<s> It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
<s> Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
<s> Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
<s> Absolutely!
<s> Stuff it.
<s> An angle?
<s> Who?
<s> Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
<s> Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
<s> But why the hair?
<s> Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
<s> You're just an experiment, freako!
<s> Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
<s> For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
<s> You are . . .
<s> Wait! Not yet! Back!
<s> You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
<s> I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
<s> Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
<s> No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
<s> Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
<s> I've been on the job.
<s> I know.
<s> No.
<s> Actually, she's silver-haired.
<s> You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
<s> Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
<s> Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
<s> They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
<s> He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
<s> Okay.  Take me to your leader.
<s> Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
<s> Tough guy, huh?
<s> I read the article.
<s> See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
<s> I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
<s> The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
<s> Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
<s> Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
<s> Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
<s> It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
<s> Folks'll ask question.
<s> Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
<s> Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
<s> Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
<s> What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
<s> -- as we will be.
<s> Twenty-four.
<s> Okay, but...why?  No offense.
<s> Oh, God! I'm going to die!
<s> Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
<s> I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
<s> Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
<s> The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
<s> Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
<s> No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
<s> Maybe I should get help.
<s> You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
<s> On radio waves?
<s> Alison Jones.
<s> Ally.  That was my nickname.
<s> I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
<s> He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
<s> How is Mrs. Stephens?
<s> Which clinic?
<s> It turns to steaming piss.
<s> I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
<s> Alison.
<s> I'll tell her that.
<s> Mister, I don't want to know your name.
<s> No you don't.
<s> Not unless you can raise the dead.
<s> You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
<s> Why are you telling me this?
<s> Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
<s> And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
<s> She's resting.  In her room.
<s> It does concern me.
<s> Why not?
<s> So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
<s> A while.
<s> No.  It should be dry by now.
<s> Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
<s> Do they have any reputation for drugs?
<s> Berries.
<s> Were his parents...attentive to him?
<s> You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
<s> That would complicate things.
<s> What other people?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
<s> Hi, Dolores.
<s> Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
<s> The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
<s> How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
<s> Well, winter's far behind us now.
<s> No.  What's this lawyer business?
<s> Did he say what about?
<s> That's what he said.
<s> What's a ditty again?
<s> Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
<s> What, Mason?
<s> So he was mean?
<s> You hate that.
<s> That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
<s> I won't lie.
<s> Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
<s> Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
<s> Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
<s> ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
<s> Perfect.
<s> Thanks.
<s> A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
<s> You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
<s> I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
<s> Is there shrimp on it?
<s> Who are you?
<s> No.
<s> You've been retained?
<s> Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
<s> Do you have this agreement with you?
<s> Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
<s> And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
<s> Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
<s> You remember that much?
<s> Yes.
<s> You mean it?
<s> Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
<s> Oh.  I better get some spackle.
<s> No.
<s> Great.
<s> You don't know that.
<s> Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
<s> I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
<s> Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
<s> See my mother?
<s> I'm late for a date with a dame.
<s> And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
<s> You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
<s> No, I wouldn't...
<s> Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
<s> Who said Sidney?
<s> I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
<s> J.J., Steve isn't...
<s> Susan!...
<s> Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
<s> Can I come in for a minute?
<s> Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
<s> Not "we", Sidney, you!
<s> What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
<s> Get Steve back his job...please...
<s> No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
<s> Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
<s> Don't go wild, Sidney.
<s> The man in jail is always for freedom.
<s> You're incapable of the truth...
<s> I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
<s> He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
<s> Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
<s> You're sure.  Find out for me.
<s> But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
<s> That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
<s> Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
<s> Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
<s> Nothing I didn't think of you before.
<s> It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
<s> Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
<s> Yes.
<s> That's no way to talk...
<s> Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
<s> Why not you?
<s> Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
<s> Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
<s> What ship?
<s> Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
<s> But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
<s> Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
<s> If the stores are open -
<s> Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
<s> Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
<s> I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
<s> Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
<s> My mission is to protect you.
<s> You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
<s> Liquid metal.
<s> Max.
<s> Anything it samples by physical contact.
<s> That is one of my mission parameters.
<s> Of course.  I'm a terminator.
<s> Cool.
<s> No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
<s> Chill out, dickwad.
<s> Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
<s> Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
<s> No problemo.
<s> What?
<s> I'm sorry, John.
<s> Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
<s> But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
<s> Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
<s> Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
<s> Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
<s> And what it that?
<s> I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
<s> Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
<s> Unknown.
<s> So do you.
<s> Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
<s> Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
<s> I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
<s> No.  There is another chip.
<s> On all what?
<s> I don't know.
<s> For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
<s> Some.
<s> I guess it's possible.
<s> Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
<s> Yeah.
<s> With more what? More what?
<s> David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
<s> In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
<s> Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
<s> But... he only wrote nine, Major.
<s> Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
<s> What's not right?
<s> I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
<s> I don't buy that.
<s> I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
<s> Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
<s> And what was that?
<s> Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
<s> Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
<s> No!
<s> Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
<s> I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
<s> Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
<s> What?
<s> Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
<s> That's what I asked.
<s> Do you know what's in this archive?
<s> Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
<s> The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
<s> One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
<s> Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
<s> Who's he?
<s> Jeez, and I never heard of him.
<s> Right. Claims assessor.
<s> Like this bandleader.
<s> Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
<s> Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
<s> The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
<s> Alright!
<s> All.
<s> That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
<s> I hate the beige one.
<s> 
<s> What's it to ya?
<s> One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
<s> Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
<s> Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
<s> It's okay.  Forget it.
<s> I volunteered.
<s> Okay.  Talk some more.
<s> Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
<s> I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
<s> If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
<s> No.  I'm not.
<s> It's better that way.
<s> You're not supposed to.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why?
<s> Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
<s> Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
<s> There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
<s> You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
<s> I don't think he's breathing.
<s> He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
<s> What <u>is</u> your problem?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Why... ?
<s> Right.  Call me Christy.
<s> Seriously?  What did they say?
<s> Come here...
<s> Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
<s> Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
<s> I don't...
<s> Get out.
<s> Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
<s> Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
<s> Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
<s> Where'd you get that gun?
<s> Shut up!
<s> You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
<s> That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
<s> I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
<s> Big family... small?
<s> Single?
<s> Boyfriend?
<s> Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
<s> Which grad-school?
<s> I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
<s> Like a stroke?
<s> Okay.
<s> They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
<s> Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
<s> Really?
<s> No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
<s> Stop this.  It's not true...
<s> Stop it!
<s> Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
<s> Have you gone to the police?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, very lucky.
<s> You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
<s> A game?
<s> Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
<s> Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
<s> What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
<s> Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
<s> Have a nice day.
<s> Thank you.  Goodnight.
<s> Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
<s> Fine.
<s> Ilsa... you're alright?
<s> He came to my mind recently, that's all.
<s> Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
<s> You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
<s> No.
<s> I know who she is.  Take a message.
<s> Why are you following me?
<s> Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
<s> Don't ask.
<s> Sam...  Thank you.
<s> Who's Watts?
<s> Do we still get paid for the week?
<s> Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
<s> Luke.
<s> Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
<s> And that will be a good place to end this study.
<s> Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
<s> She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
<s> You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
<s> I got more scared.
<s> It was.
<s> Why?
<s> It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
<s> Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
<s> No --
<s> Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
<s> There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
<s> Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
<s> I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
<s> It's all I could afford.
<s> I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
<s> Yes.  I've missed it.
<s> You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
<s> Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
<s> Maybe you did it yourself.
<s> I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
<s> I have a loft.
<s> I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
<s> I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
<s> We all did.
<s> I'm a gracious host.
<s> All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
<s> We think?
<s> Not bad.
<s> Where do we go?
<s> What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
<s> Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
<s> Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
<s> Not me, man.
<s> Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
<s> He's gotta know why.
<s> Not much -- you?
<s> No, but I know what he means.
<s> Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
<s> If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
<s> Not ashamed.
<s> Footloose and fancy free.
<s> Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
<s> He give me your address.
<s> Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
<s> My employer.
<s> Depends, don' it.
<s> You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
<s> You ever been to London?
<s> What'd your father do?
<s> Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
<s> Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
<s> How do you know?
<s> No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
<s> All of what?
<s> My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
<s> Unless I'm not who I think I am.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
<s> The forever kind.
<s> So what.
<s> Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
<s> Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
<s> What do you think?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Since when?
<s> I don't want you here, Terry.
<s> No trouble.
<s> That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
<s> I don't.
<s> I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
<s> At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
<s> A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
<s> The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
<s> Hello, Tony.
<s> Boy.
<s> I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
<s> Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
<s> And how do we share--
<s> I'll have it in a week.
<s> Way out of line.
<s> That'll be fine.
<s> Look, uh... Creighton...
<s> *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
<s> No, Dave, I wasn't.
<s> Mm.
<s> How's business, Dave?
<s> Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
<s> Big Dave--
<s> Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
<s> So?
<s> Mm.
<s> Honey...
<s> You don't have to tell me anything.
<s> *I* was with her.
<s> ...who among us is in a position to say...
<s> Sure you don't need one?
<s> OK. Boy. Jesus!
<s> Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
<s> I'm fine. Thanks.
<s> Sure, Walter. Thanks.
<s> Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
<s> I know who you are, Mr Crane.
<s> Sorry, I just didn't remember.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, yeah--go home.
<s> What the--
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> That's very generous.
<s> Crane. Ed Crane.
<s> Yeah--
<s> Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
<s> Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
<s> I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
<s> The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
<s> Why not?
<s> He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
<s> Do they have to wear uniforms?
<s> I don't want to scare people.
<s> What's the combination?
<s> Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
<s> That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
<s> Like hell!
<s> Whose footprints?
<s> So the method of death is the only connection?
<s> We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
<s> The sub-basement?
<s> The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
<s> All right everybody, hold up!
<s> Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
<s> Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
<s> You're right.
<s> Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
<s> Don't stop now.
<s> No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
<s> Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
<s> And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
<s> Yes.
<s> Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> You're color blind.
<s> He's right.  Follow me.
<s> Keep the animal quiet.
<s> Margo, you haven't heard?
<s> Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
<s> Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
<s> An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
<s> Maybe not.
<s> You have time to talk?
<s> I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
<s> You were afraid of him, weren't you?
<s> A monster?
<s> Would you mind showing it to me?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Where did you see it?
<s> No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
<s> Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
<s> How?
<s> It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
<s> I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<s> You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
<s> Why wouldn't I?
<s> All prop cars accounted for?
<s> We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
<s> Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
<s> No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
<s> They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
<s> Now.
<s> If we don't go now, it won't happen.
<s> So when are you leaving?
<s> Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
<s> --Truman, what are you doing here?
<s> No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
<s> Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
<s> Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
<s> They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
<s> I've been thinking--
<s> How do you know?
<s> Good night, Mother.
<s> Put some butter on it--or ice?
<s> I won't be here Sunday.
<s> There's been an accident, Truman.
<s> They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
<s> You're not FBI agents.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Brought on by what?
<s> Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
<s> Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
<s> Kurtzweil, we think.
<s> No. Don't bother.
<s> Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
<s> I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
<s> How?
<s> What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
<s> What did it look like?
<s> Where are you, Scully?
<s> Did you find something?
<s> You're looking for a bomb.
<s> The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
<s> I'm in the vending room.
<s> Nice try, Mulder.
<s> Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
<s> Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
<s> All I told them was the truth.
<s> I was until about an hour ago.
<s> According to this tag.
<s> Mulder --
<s> This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
<s> It looks pretty green for this climate.
<s> I don't know why I think they went right.
<s> This is great. This is fitting.
<s> They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
<s> What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
<s> Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
<s> Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
<s> I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
<s> You can't quit, Scully.
<s> That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
<s> Thank you.
<s> She was with me.
<s> I'm not taking any chances.
<s> I've got to find Scully.
<s> What do you mean, walked?
<s> The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
<s> I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
<s> And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
<s> A pocketful of rye...
<s> Lucien Baines?
<s> A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
<s> Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
<s> Four and twenty blackbirds...
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
<s> Give a kiss to Edward.
<s> Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
<s> I did, yeah.
<s> Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
<s> You're sure of that?
<s> It doesn't matter...
<s> I need you to find something in the basement...
<s> Sometime yesterday morning.
<s> That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
<s> I don't have to.
<s> Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
<s> Do you understand German?
<s> I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
<s> That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
<s> Dr. Winkel told me that.
<s> I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
<s> The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
<s> They're forged.
<s> Need we go through it all again?
<s> In German?
<s> Well you read this.
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> Wait here.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
<s> Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
<s> How did you know I would be here?
<s> His.
<s> If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
<s> And my passport?
<s> No.
<s> Two weeks ago.
<s> I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
<s> I don't...
<s> I was a friend of Harry Lime.
<s> Just around the corner.
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> Martins.
<s> When did you see him last?
<s> I can't say that I have.
<s> What are you trying to say?
<s> Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
<s> Calloway.
<s> Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
<s> Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
<s> Bring him in.
<s> I'm not asking you to.
<s> She's right. It's none of my business.
<s> I said you win.
<s> I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
<s> Two thirty.
<s> This way, miss.
<s> I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
<s> Of course, of course, of course.
<s> Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
<s> You wouldn't do anything.
<s> Why not?
<s> Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
<s> At the end of every chapter --
<s> Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
<s> I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
<s> What's the name of this girl?
<s> But you will.
<s> The Roumanian?
<s> I have guests waiting.
<s> I understand...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Mr. Lime - yes.
<s> Yes, yes, I remember you.
<s> Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
<s> Yes.
<s> You don't mean that doctor?
<s> Well make it your business.
<s> Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
<s> What else?
<s> He didn't want to get involved.
<s> With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
<s> We moved rooms because of him.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
<s> Hi there. Here, take a look.
<s> Where did you lose it?
<s> So?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
<s> Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
<s> What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
<s> Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
<s> How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
<s> People still need values, beliefs....
<s> Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
<s> That's stupid. Why would they?
<s> Why won't you talk to me?
<s> You can't.
<s> No.
<s> I stole it. From a synagogue.
<s> No difference.
<s> Don't curse in front of it.
<s> You shouldn't.
<s> 'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
<s> Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
<s> I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
<s> And be crushed.
<s> Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
<s> I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
<s> Obviously.
<s> How would you kill him?
<s> They're liars and cowards.
<s> It's the truth....
<s> No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
<s> What about Curtis Zampf?
<s> What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
<s> I don't know. Is that right?
<s> Why?
<s> Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
<s> He has Israel.
<s> Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
<s> I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
<s> You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
<s> The arguments, anyway.
<s> How did you...?
<s> I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
<s> Daniel Balint.
<s> Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
<s> No, I don't admit it's stupid.
<s> Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
<s> No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
<s> You could do it.
<s> You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
<s> Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
<s> I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
<s> You said they didn't have night guards.
<s> Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
<s> No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
<s> Why me?
<s> I can tell....
<s> I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
<s> Dennis Leary.
<s> No.
<s> Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
<s> None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
<s> I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
<s> Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
<s> I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
<s> Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
<s> ... So am I.
<s> The documents are forged.
<s> I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
<s> What was he like, when he was little?
<s> Enzo!
<s> Don't.
<s> You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Then tell him to wax it too.
<s> "That"!  This is not a "that"...
<s> Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
<s> Enzo...
<s> Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
<s> Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
<s> Not at all!
<s> What?
<s> ... For the mermaids.
<s> ... I'm listening.
<s> Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
<s> You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
<s> What is it?
<s> Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
<s> No... in the hut.
<s> I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
<s> Lucky I was there to save you.
<s> ... The way she moves.
<s> I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
<s> You'll understand.
<s> Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
<s> Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
<s> What?
<s> Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
<s> ... Sally?
<s> Again?
<s> Way past it.
<s> No.  I'm just depressed.
<s> They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
<s> Of course, that's what they're for.
<s> Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
<s> ... Yes?
<s> Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
<s> I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
<s> Sure. Why not.
<s> I said, yeah, about once a week!
<s> Yes Esther.
<s> Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
<s> I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
<s> Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
<s> ...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
<s> Mazel Tov!
<s> She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
<s> No, it was the perfect level.
<s> Good looking?
<s> What about me?
<s> I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
<s> But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
<s> You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
<s> Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
<s> Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
<s> That's right, of course.
<s> Yes?
<s> It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
<s> Charlie likes his leopard.
<s> A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
<s> I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
<s> There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
<s> That was a calamity!
<s> Why?
<s> Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
<s> Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
<s> Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
<s> Don't be soft.
<s> The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
<s> Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
<s> We will 
<s> It's all right. I'm not hurt.
<s> I know -- Teresa -
<s> We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
<s> Must it?
<s> Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
<s> And that is the last time any...
<s> Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
<s> Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> The man who sold the boy to your brother.
<s> Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
<s> Paul Lamont...?
<s> How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> Leon hung himself.
<s> Leon hung himself...
<s> ...You-you spoke to him?
<s> If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
<s> Something like that.
<s> Here we go again.
<s> Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
<s> What are you doing? You cant. I...
<s> On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
<s> Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
<s> No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
<s> Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
<s> I know where to look.
<s> Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
<s> So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
<s> That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
<s> Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
<s> Ill call again.
<s> Can I have the reception desk, please.
<s> No.
<s> Should I?
<s> Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
<s> Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
<s> Its not.
<s> Your secretary, huh!
<s> What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
<s> Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
<s> I hope its not too significant.
<s> You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
<s> Do what, Mr Lombard?
<s> Then you should not have sought an explanation.
<s> Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
<s> Shut up and drive!
<s> Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
<s> Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
<s> Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
<s> Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
<s> I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.
<s> The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
<s> Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
<s> Ill be alone.
<s> Should I be?
<s> Can I get up now?
<s> His mother would be pleased to hear that.
<s> Do you know Leons parents names?
<s> My sister... She lives in the next valley.
<s> The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
<s> Los Angeles?
<s> Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
<s> Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
<s> Shut up and walk...
<s> It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
<s> Cost what?
<s> No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
<s> Do you think I could have some water?
<s> Now?
<s> Uh... they said... they will think about it.
<s> But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
<s> Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
<s> Not yet!
<s> You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
<s> I'm staying, Jean.
<s> I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
<s> Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
<s> Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
<s> No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
<s> We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
<s> So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
<s> Scared of a girl?
<s> But where are you going to be?
<s> Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
<s> My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
<s> Nineteen... or thereabouts...
<s> Last night.
<s> So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
<s> Silence her!  Take her away...!
<s> Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
<s> I'm... I'm not the king...
<s> Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
<s> Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
<s> There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
<s> Go and ask him yourself.
<s> I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
<s> I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
<s> Everywhere.  Where is the food?
<s> We need another ten minutes...
<s> Not yet.
<s> Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
<s> Yes.  We can pray.
<s> I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
<s> Of course I do?  Bring them up!
<s> No...
<s> That's now what I meant...
<s> Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
<s> I might ask you the same question.
<s> Yes!
<s> I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
<s> Why not?
<s> No, but... he sent me so many signs!
<s> Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
<s> No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
<s> ... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> I need to confess.
<s> I need to confess again.
<s> Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
<s> Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
<s> I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
<s> A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
<s> My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
<s> That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
<s> What are you doing?
<s> American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
<s> What?
<s> We use what?
<s> Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
<s> I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
<s> Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
<s> You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
<s> I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
<s> I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
<s> Out of Warsaw. Where?
<s> Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
<s> Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
<s> The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
<s> We're getting out.
<s> Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
<s> I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
<s> No sound at all?
<s> That is good, yes.
<s> Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
<s> Yes, it's unholy.
<s> No, no bible readers.
<s> I'll be back.
<s> I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
<s> Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
<s> Spoken words?
<s> What are they?
<s> I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
<s> I just want to listen.
<s> What happened?
<s> She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
<s> Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
<s> What will I play?
<s> Who told ya this guy was in here?
<s> I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
<s> I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
<s> I had some appointments.
<s> I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
<s> What?
<s> He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
<s> Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
<s> Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
<s> He was a con man, wasn't he?
<s> The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
<s> You sure he didn't just pocket it?
<s> Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
<s> Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
<s> He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
<s> I picked something up on the way.
<s> I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
<s> You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
<s> And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
<s> Why?
<s> If we ever get to it.
<s> Yeh, it was easy.
<s> I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
<s> Did he say he wouldn't?
<s> All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
<s> Then why you doin' it?
<s> If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
<s> What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
<s> The name is Lonnegan.
<s> Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
<s> Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
<s> Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
<s> 2:00 A.M.
<s> No.  What's wrong with the front?
<s> Yeh, this time anyway.
<s> You move right along, don't ya.
<s> All right, when?
<s> Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
<s> Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
<s> I feel lucky tonight.
<s> He cheats.
<s> Then why the rat?
<s> That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
<s> 660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
<s> I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
<s> Give 'em a little time.
<s> You got a system, Carver?
<s> All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
<s> With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
<s> I don't know.  He took it hard.
<s> Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
<s> What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
<s> He was?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> But tonight is Christmas Eve!
<s> Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
<s> Said he stole his invention.
<s> Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
<s> I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
<s> I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
<s> was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
<s> Yes.
<s> Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
<s> Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
<s> Forgive me.  How are you?
<s> Yes, she would.
<s> What would your mother say to that?
<s> A new invention?
<s> We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
<s> It's a promise?
<s> Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
<s> Do you mind if I come down and see it?
<s> I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
<s> We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
<s> So you say -  Go on, Bob.
<s> Nothing yet to cinch it.
<s> Who's your candidate?
<s> They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
<s> I think we're on the right track.
<s> She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
<s> Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
<s> I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
<s> I'll take care of him.
<s> Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
<s> You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
<s> Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
<s> He did!
<s> When was that?
<s> Did you go?
<s> A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
<s> Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
<s> How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
<s> What bonds?
<s> What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
<s> supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
<s> Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
<s> You're going to return every cent of it!
<s> Good.
<s> I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
<s> I trust you.
<s> Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
<s> My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
<s> Hello, Mimi.
<s> Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
<s> Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
<s> They'll want more than your word for that.
<s> You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
<s> Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
<s> I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
<s> Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
<s> I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
<s> We need ice.
<s> I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
<s> She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
<s> Maybe it would if I took it.
<s> Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
<s> Breakfast.
<s> That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
<s> He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
<s> You did.
<s> I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
<s> Let's see.  Where's it from?
<s> I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
<s> Why, I believe the little woman cares.
<s> Sure.
<s> I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
<s> I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
<s> Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
<s> After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
<s> Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
<s> Yes.  Nick!
<s> I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
<s> Home!
<s> Baghdad.
<s> No, please, not again.
<s> He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Maybe I do.
<s> I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
<s> How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
<s> We're at war.
<s> It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
<s> I did it!  I got the box open.
<s> Wait.  Wait.
<s> Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
<s> We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
<s> I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
<s> Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
<s> I got that...sir.
<s> Mine.
<s> Shut up and listen!
<s> It's a fire fight.
<s> Stay low.
<s> I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
<s> What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
<s> Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
<s> What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Damn.
<s> Okay.  Then we go this way.
<s> Don't you touch it.
<s> Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
<s> I don't have a weapon.
<s> We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
<s> We go this way.
<s> You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
<s> Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
<s> Really?
<s> He'll slow down.
<s> Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
<s> I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
<s> Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
<s> I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
<s> Yeah.  So?
<s> Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
<s> You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
<s> What?
<s> How the hell should I know how much?
<s> A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
<s> ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
<s> Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
<s> Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
<s> Guess we know what the next stop is.
<s> Yeah, we're down.
<s> He lived through that?
<s> I'm not wasting my water on him.
<s> What happened?
<s> Now.
<s> Don't go.
<s> Looks like dirt.
<s> But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
<s> AH UGH.
<s> No one can see us now we're alone.
<s> I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
<s> What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
<s> We're leaving.
<s> THX and me.
<s> I want you for my roommate.
<s> I don't feel well.
<s> Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
<s> No, I...
<s> All the insides are gone!
<s> All right...
<s> You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
<s> Yes...
<s> You should know better than that!
<s> Where are they?
<s> -Where?
<s> We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
<s> No thanks, Bev.
<s> Hang on.
<s> She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
<s> Oh yeah? Prove it.
<s> Just how easy is it to build a... device?
<s> Look, it's a longshot...
<s> What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
<s> I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
<s> No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
<s> Be right back.
<s> Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
<s> Stay to your left.
<s> It's from an IRA.
<s> Take him!
<s> I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
<s> Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
<s> Look, it's important.
<s> Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
<s> Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
<s> Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
<s> What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
<s> Don't talk.
<s> You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
<s> My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
<s> Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
<s> I thought I told you--
<s> It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
<s> So you lost a handbag, madame?
<s> At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
<s> Yes, M'sieu Laval?
<s> I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
<s> <u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
<s> Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
<s> Umm.
<s> Um-hum ...
<s> Just a second.
<s> No--proud. Very proud!
<s> Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Gaston Monescu.
<s> Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<s> <u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<s> Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
<s> I know that niche.
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Oh!
<s> M'sieu Laval!
<s> What's wrong now?
<s> Peaches and cream.
<s> That sounds sensible. 
<s> What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
<s> And so will M'sieu Giron.
<s> What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
<s> You would?
<s> I <u>believe</u> you.
<s> Please! 
<s> No--thirty-five! 
<s> What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
<s> Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
<s> But it could have been glorious.
<s> Yes--uh--
<s> I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
<s> Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
<s> Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
<s> Well--uh--yes and no.
<s> I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
<s> Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
<s> I don't want your money!
<s> He started it.
<s> That's true.
<s> Well, he was in the navy.
<s> Yes, my bag!
<s> But you saw it here.
<s> Well, where is it?
<s> The pumps --
<s> About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
<s> Yes, I understand. Thank you.
<s> Hurry, Rose.
<s> Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
<s> It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
<s> Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
<s> Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
<s> The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
<s> I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
<s> Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
<s> What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
<s> Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
<s> Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
<s> We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
<s> Bollocks.
<s> We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
<s> No, but we're making excellent time.
<s> Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
<s> I've got you. I won't let go.
<s> Could I speak to you in private?
<s> No, no! Just with her hands.
<s> I'm sorry. Really... I am.
<s> Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
<s> They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
<s> I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
<s> I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
<s> You're right. Only you can do that.
<s> He does landscapes.
<s> Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
<s> I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
<s> We'll find out.
<s> Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
<s> I can't feel my body.
<s> We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
<s> It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
<s> This is Miss Marsh.
<s> I'll join you later.
<s> --and I can tell you where to get off.
<s> I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
<s> That's a date. 
<s> Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Isn't that interesting?
<s> Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
<s> I'll bet a couple of hundred.
<s> Sure!  Excuse me.
<s> I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
<s> Very much--
<s> --sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
<s> Never eat before the show.
<s> You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
<s> What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
<s> Very--your mother?
<s> You asked me to dine with you tonight.
<s> Well, I can't.
<s> But I'll have cocktails with you.
<s> Okay.
<s> Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
<s> For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
<s> Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
<s> I'll be waiting on deck.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
<s> Shortie, look!
<s> Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
<s> Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
<s> Change?
<s> Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
<s> You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
<s> Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
<s> Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
<s> Partners, ain't we?
<s> <U>Me</U>!
<s> Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
<s> Think again--
<s> Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
<s> I wouldn't be surprised--
<s> Hey!--you're tickling me.
<s> Wait a minute--let's match for it.
<s> Send that.
<s> Next month is June.
<s> June? That's my wife's name.
<s> O.K.! Send that!
<s> I thought I put you to bed.
<s> This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
<s> She's in New York.
<s> Who won?
<s> I was never stiffer in my life.
<s> Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
<s> Is this your gun?
<s> You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
<s> Like it?
<s> News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
<s> Very serious?
<s> Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
<s> But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
<s> No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
<s> Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
<s> Good-night, folks.
<s> Eh?... Oh.
<s> Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
<s> Thanks to me.
<s> Not a chance--I'm through. 
<s> S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
<s> Sure, Sis.
<s> If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
<s> Nice voice.
<s> That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
<s> Maybe even my destiny.
<s> Beauty, ain't he?
<s> Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
<s> They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> But wait, you don't understand-
<s> Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
<s> Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
<s> Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
<s> I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
<s> You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
<s> Sorry, sorry...
<s> No...
<s> I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
<s> Then what do I do?
<s> Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
<s> Not half as bad as I feel.
<s> Wyatt Earp is my friend.
<s> What?  But I saw 'em-
<s> You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
<s> What was that all about?
<s> I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
<s> What?
<s> All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
<s> I know.  Me neither.
<s> Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
<s> Where do you get these questions?
<s> The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
<s> Fortuitous even.
<s> I forgave you the moment you said it.
<s> Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
<s> I think I'll just lie down awhile
<s> I don't know.  I'm all right.
<s> Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
<s> Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
<s> 'Least they don't scare women.
<s> McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
<s> If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
<s> All right, run 'em off.
<s> They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
<s> Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
<s> Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
<s> Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
<s> Fine.  Better.
<s> I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
<s> Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
<s> Jack...
<s> Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
<s> I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
<s> Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
<s> You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
<s> I see.
<s> Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
<s> Good-bye, Mister Bond.
<s> Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
<s> Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
<s> Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
<s> I appreciate your time -
<s> Where can I find him?
<s> Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
<s> - We all want what we can't have?
<s> - Four wheel drive?
<s> Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
<s> Do you?
<s> Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
<s> Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
<s> I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
<s> Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
<s> Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
<s> This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
<s> I hope so.
<s> No. I'm going with you.
<s> My father left me the business.
<s> Cleans dirt. Let's go.
<s> We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
<s> Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
<s> I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
<s> Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
<s> Captain Morton.
<s> You leave me no alternative.
<s> No -
<s> Excellent.
<s> Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
<s> - I told you! He was there! -
<s> Approaching the first gate.
<s> You have to leave -
<s> You come with me -  You stay here.
<s> It's Bond!
<s> No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
<s> Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
<s> You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
<s> You always got something to say.
<s> My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
<s> What is a sip of coffee going to do?
<s> He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
<s> Like a veil has been lifted?
<s> I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
<s> Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
<s> This would be a bad time for me to leave.
<s> Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
<s> Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
<s> Babe Brother is a poor boy.
<s> I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
<s> You better come sit down. You are still sick.
<s> I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
<s> He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
<s> Why didn't you catch a plane?
<s> Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
<s> That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
<s> You should go back and rest.
<s> He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
<s> Let me get you a cup?
<s> You must have done something to her.
<s> I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
<s> You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
<s> That's nice.
<s> Girl, do you still sing and dance?
<s> That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
<s> You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
<s> What's a toby?
<s> Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
<s> I was just trying to make conversation.
<s> I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
<s> You can bring ONE toy...
<s> No, I haven't seen him.
<s> Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
<s> Where was the last place you left him?
<s> Bye, house.
<s> What?  What is it?
<s> HO-YAAAHH!!!
<s> I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
<s> Watch yourself!!
<s> No, you can't.
<s> Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
<s> You're mocking me, aren't you?
<s> You mean that happy child?
<s> I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
<s> Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
<s> Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
<s> Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
<s> Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
<s> Woody!  The rocket!
<s> We're not aiming for the truck!
<s> Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
<s> I can't see a thing!
<s> Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
<s> Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
<s> Alright!  That's it!
<s> I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
<s> That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
<s> No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
<s> Toss 'im overboard!
<s> Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
<s> Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
<s> He got it, Woody!
<s> Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
<s> Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
<s> Got it.
<s> See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
<s> Slink!  Hang on!
<s> You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
<s> She got away.
<s> I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
<s> You're not so old yourself!
<s> Well ... yes. All right. But -
<s> Finn -
<s> He'll be looking for another apprentice.
<s> Can you move over a wee bit?
<s> Did you now.
<s> Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
<s> He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
<s> He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
<s> Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
<s> Arnie, thank God.
<s> Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
<s> What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
<s> I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
<s> I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
<s> That's frustrating.
<s> Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
<s> I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
<s> Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
<s> Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
<s> Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
<s> Me, too.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Hi.
<s> I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
<s> Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
<s> Nope.
<s> She ain't in on it.
<s> I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
<s> There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
<s> You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
<s> I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
<s> That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
<s> Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
<s> We agree.
<s> It was an anonymous tip.
<s> Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
<s> If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
<s> Any idea how much?
<s> Just tell me where she is.
<s> It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
<s> Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
<s> Diane.
<s> It's where I live.
<s> Eh-
<s> Out.
<s> Sixteen next month.
<s> Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
<s> Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
<s> Oh, really?
<s> Of course, the motto, the motto --
<s> No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
<s> I'm sorry, Tommy.
<s> Right.
<s> And you might get the fucking job.
<s> My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
<s> Another dab?
<s> One hundred and sixteen minutes.
<s> Eh - Ian Fleming?
<s> Roald Dahl.
<s> OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
<s> Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
<s> It wasn't that bad.
<s> No, he didn't make me touch it.
<s> When are you going to visit him?
<s> We're two thousand short.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> As you wish.
<s> And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
<s> The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
<s> Sure will, pal, sure will.
<s> It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
<s> Six weeks.
<s> But where?
<s> No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
<s> And how did you breach the Barrier?
<s> Then I shall make use of this starship.
<s> Rescued at last.
<s> Is there a problem, gentlemen?
<s> And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
<s> Plotting our new course.
<s> DO it. Go to Red Alert.
<s> I don't have a clue.
<s> Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
<s> What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
<s> Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
<s> Goodnight, Doctor.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Fascinating.
<s> Damn.  Let's go.
<s> An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
<s> No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
<s> The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
<s> But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
<s> That's a little vague, Spock -
<s> The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
<s> Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
<s> Not possible. You were never alone.
<s> I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
<s> James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
<s> Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
<s> No conditions.
<s> 
<s>   
<s> 
<s> Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
<s> It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
<s> Do you?
<s> You invented Space Paranoids?
<s> Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
<s> Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
<s> I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
<s> Uh... got any cinnamon?
<s> And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
<s> You call that getting over it?
<s> To warn him.
<s> Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
<s> Yes, okay, exactement!
<s> It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
<s> There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
<s> Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
<s> The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
<s> It can be arranged...
<s> I... have come to communicate with my User.
<s> Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
<s> Where did you hear that name?
<s> You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
<s> Yes.
<s> A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
<s> Alan-One...
<s> Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
<s> We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
<s> I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
<s> You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
<s> End of line.
<s> Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
<s> I had to...in the games...
<s> As long as it gets us out of here
<s> I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
<s> So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
<s> Simon?  Ohmygod.
<s> It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
<s> He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
<s> Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
<s> Yeah, Dad.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
<s> Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
<s> Why?
<s> Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
<s> Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
<s> I still don't believe it.
<s> Put a tap on her phone.
<s> Yeah, but for who?							*
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
<s> If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> It's certainly... dramatic.
<s> Is that why you got into this business?
<s> Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
<s> Yeah, it was wild.
<s> It's not okay.  It's extortion.
<s> What'd you do, honey?
<s> It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
<s> My husband the hero.
<s> Well, maybe a little.
<s> You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
<s> Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
<s> My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
<s> What about Juno?
<s> I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
<s> So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
<s> What about the husbands?
<s> I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
<s> Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
<s> You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
<s> I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't.
<s> Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
<s> Find out who this Renquist it.
<s> His wife.
<s> Wait a minute -
<s> What letter?
<s> You can't have just one.
<s> And here we are.
<s> It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
<s> Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
<s> How 'bout me what?
<s> What's your favorite movie star?
<s> Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
<s> At the movies?
<s> Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
<s> You didn't do nothing.
<s> I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
<s> Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
<s> Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
<s> I just gotta get somethin'.
<s> What?
<s> You don't know him -
<s> You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
<s> Really?
<s> Cancoon.
<s> It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
<s> I heard that.
<s> In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
<s> Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
<s> You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
<s> You wanna get unhaunted?
<s> Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
<s> Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
<s> She's with me.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
<s> Get the fuck outta here!
<s> Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
<s> It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
<s> Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
<s> Elliot.
<s> What's to think about?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah, let's just get outta here.
<s> Really?
<s> I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
<s> How 'bout me what?
<s> Sure. I didn't hear anything.
<s> They'll be along.
<s> I guess so. Follow me.
<s> No. No you're not.
<s> The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
<s> I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
<s> Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
<s> A Norms in Van Nuys.
<s> Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
<s> Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
<s> You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
<s> She seems very nice.
<s> Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
<s> Do tell. Why drug related?
<s> Who is he?
<s> Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
<s> I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
<s> That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
<s> I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
<s> Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
<s> I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
<s> I believe he believes him.
<s> Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
<s> No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
<s> Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
<s> We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
<s> Pussy love pink rocks.
<s> Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
<s> I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
<s> Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
<s> Yeah, I live here.
<s> No.
<s> I didn't mean -
<s> Uh, I didn't hear the...
<s> Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
<s> Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
<s> I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
<s> I need to go now.
<s> "James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
<s> No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
<s> You wouldn't understand.
<s> I have to go.
<s> What?
<s> You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
<s> I've got one now.
<s> James, why don't we...?
<s> And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
<s> I thought you didn't know how to drive.
<s> No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
<s> No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
<s> We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
<s> I don't know -- I don't remember.
<s> A Carpet Cleaning Company?
<s> Well, you look pretty different, too.
<s> Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
<s> I need to make a telephone call.
<s> Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
<s> How did you find me?
<s> The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
<s> And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
<s> Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
<s> You really want to know?
<s> That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
<s> You want to go in?  Examine him?
<s> James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
<s> Might be tight.
<s> You want something, old man?
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> Yeah, yeah.
<s> I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
<s> Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
<s> That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
<s> Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
<s> Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
<s> We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
<s> Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
<s> Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
<s> That's my morning's pay.
<s> I got more brains than you've got teeth.
<s> Out of here.
<s> How much.
<s> The ticket is thirty dollars.
<s> Yep.
<s> Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
<s> Time.
<s> You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
<s> There you go, sweet talking me again.
<s> I want my car.
<s> Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
<s> Genuine Draft?
<s> You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
<s> Yes.  Yes it is.
<s> I . . .
<s> John . . .
<s> I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
<s> I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
<s> You didn't hear something?
<s> What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
<s> My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
<s> Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
<s> Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
<s> I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> I pack up and go somewhere else.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
<s> I guess it must.
<s> From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
<s> Come here.
<s> I have ideas.
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.
<s> I can't.
<s> If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
<s> What about us?
<s> Because I know you're full of shit.
<s> Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
<s> We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
<s> After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
<s> I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
<s> What about him?
<s> I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
<s> Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
<s> You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
<s> What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
<s> He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
<s> What for?
<s> Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
<s> I'm her husband.
<s> Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
<s> I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
<s> How do you know if you've never tried?
<s> I did?
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
<s> Is the job done?
<s> You didn't kill her?
<s> I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
<s> Trouble with the car again?
<s> Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
<s> That's a thick change of heart.
<s> Wh . . . what are you talking about?
<s> What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
<s> You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
<s> You're too quick for me.
<s> For what?
<s> Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
<s> How old are you?
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
<s> You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
<s> A hundred-forty-five really.
<s> Yes, Mr. Vesci.
<s> Wouldn't know anything about it.
<s> Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
<s> Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
<s> I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> Christ!
<s> I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
<s> Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
<s> No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
<s> Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
<s> I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
<s> Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
<s> Give it to me!
<s> Who the hell are you?
<s> Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
<s> You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
<s> Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
<s> Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
<s> You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
<s> I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
<s> That country shit all sounds the same to me.
<s> Will you shut up!
<s> Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
<s> Yep.
<s> Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
<s> That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
<s> It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
<s> What?
<s> Eh?
<s> No! No police.
<s> You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
<s> No trouble at all, really.
<s> You're welcome, Grace.
<s> Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
<s> I guess I've got wander in my blood.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
<s> Did you like it; me watching you?
<s> A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
<s> From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
<s> Those are white words, not ours.
<s> Still playing?
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.
<s> You could leave him.
<s> You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
<s> Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
<s> Try me.
<s> Is it pretty?
<s> If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
<s> Because I know you're full of shit.
<s> I thought you couldn't get your car.
<s> No! You get it!
<s> Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
<s> I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
<s> And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
<s> He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
<s> Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
<s> Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
<s> With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
<s> Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
<s> One way.
<s> The ticket is 30.55.
<s> I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
<s> No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
<s> More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
<s> Oh?
<s> No baby, you got it wrong.
<s> You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
<s> ...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
<s> You didn't hear something?
<s> Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
<s> What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
<s> I want my lawyer!
<s> Oh.
<s> You've made a considerably wise decision.
<s> I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
<s> Yes.
<s> My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
<s> I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
<s> Jesus.
<s> I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
<s> You assumed wrong.
<s> The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
<s> You've misunderstood.
<s> Is there a problem?
<s> Have you ever tried to develop it?
<s> The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
<s> That's not what I witnessed David.
<s> What's he look like?
<s> Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
<s> Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
<s> How much can you lift?
<s> I lied.
<s> You're lying.
<s> Jeremy listen to what--
<s> This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
<s> Fine.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
<s> Where is it?
<s> Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
<s> Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
<s> Three days. Are you hungry?
<s> Advances?
<s> I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
<s> Alive?
<s> Property.
<s> Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
<s> Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
<s> Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
<s> Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
<s> You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
<s> "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
<s> D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
<s> You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
<s> He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
<s> Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
<s> In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
<s> Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
<s> For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
<s> I don't never see nobody anyhow.
<s> Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
<s> He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
<s> He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
<s> If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
<s> What happened, did you hit him?
<s> Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
<s> Yup.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Eleven.
<s> You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
<s> Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
<s> Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
<s> I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
<s> What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
<s> Huh? Uh... yeah.
<s> Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
<s> Two more hogs got the fever.
<s> You gonna share your half with him?
<s> Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
<s> Move the candle closer, I can't see.
<s> We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
<s> All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
<s> We'll bury him.
<s> You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
<s> And ?
<s> I'm having a stroke.
<s> No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
<s> They'll never stop.
<s> Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> You are a criminal.
<s> Then who goes?
<s> RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
<s> Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
<s> Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
<s> They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
<s> McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
<s> McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
<s> Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
<s> Just do what I tell you.
<s> I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
<s> What time is it?
<s> Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
<s> Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
<s> Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
<s> Which is shit.
<s> Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
<s> Kobayashi.
<s> Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
<s> Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
<s> No.
<s> You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
<s> Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
<s> If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Edie.
<s> Keaton was Keyser Soze
<s> He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
<s> I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
<s> Abrams...
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Very good.
<s> As far as we know, nothing.
<s> Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
<s> Yes.
<s> ... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
<s> Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
<s> I was her doctor.
<s> Yes.
<s> `Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
<s> Tell me one?
<s> She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
<s> ...We did everything we could...
<s> Yes!
<s> My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
<s> No.
<s> I know of him.
<s> I am seventy-four years old.
<s> Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
<s> Huh!
<s> Nothing further, your Honor.
<s> I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
<s> You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
<s> I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
<s> You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
<s> Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
<s> That's what I'd planned to...
<s> ...What difference would...
<s> There's nothing they can do to me.
<s> No, you did fine.
<s> Yes...I...yes.
<s> No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
<s> I.  Yes.  It is.
<s> To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
<s> No.
<s> I've got nothing to say to you.
<s> You know, you're pushy, fella...
<s> My client can't walk, your Honor.
<s> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
<s> I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
<s> Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
<s> No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
<s> I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
<s> ...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
<s> If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
<s> Yes.  Price...
<s> Kathy Price.
<s> Missus...
<s> I changed my room at the Hotel.
<s> And are they going to get it?
<s> Maybe what?
<s> And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
<s> We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
<s> They, uh, they got to my witness.
<s> Is there going to be a later...?
<s> You, you don't under...
<s> No...no...
<s> He's not in, Sir.
<s> ...I'm going to need your help...
<s> What?
<s> I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
<s> Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You use their witness.
<s> ...one of the other nurses?
<s> ...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
<s> I don't want a mistrial.
<s> ... You saw her?
<s> We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
<s> You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I did.
<s> ...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
<s> Thanks, Franky.
<s> Huh.  And why is that?
<s> How'm I doing so far?
<s> I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
<s> No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
<s> I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
<s> Well?
<s> Have you talked to the doctors at all?
<s> All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
<s> Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
<s> What happened?
<s> 0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
<s> What about?
<s> Why?
<s> You're not far wrong.
<s> You won't have to.
<s> Your name. And --
<s> No, you don't owe me anything.
<s> I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
<s> Okay.
<s> I'll take care of you.
<s> No, Judy, you don't understand.
<s> No.
<s> I just want to see you as much as I can!
<s> Yes.
<s> Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
<s> I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
<s> It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
<s> Is that the best you can do?
<s> No, Ernie's is fine.
<s> I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
<s> I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
<s> Some money.
<s> I loved you, Madeleine.
<s> Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
<s> Why?
<s> I... didn't know where you lived.
<s> Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
<s> Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
<s> Knowing I have to die...
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Madeleine!
<s> And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
<s> No... it's in shadow.
<s> A grave...
<s> No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
<s> But I'm the woman in the mirror!
<s> I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
<s> But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
<s> No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
<s> And it's a all real.
<s> Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
<s> I love you too... too late... too late...
<s> You can't.
<s> Let me go.
<s> It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
<s> I won't lose you.
<s> I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
<s> Ah, Johnny-O...
<s> To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
<s> I'm having one now.
<s> Oh!
<s> Uh-huh!
<s> That's Skid Row... isn't it?
<s> What.
<s> All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
<s> For what?
<s> Who's the guy, who's the wife?
<s> I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
<s> Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
<s> I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
<s> Oh... this and that.
<s> How?
<s> But you said grey, sir.
<s> What?
<s> You're interrupting a personal conversation.
<s> I don't have to...
<s> Franco mother-fucking Harris!
<s> You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
<s> They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
<s> And you're a little fucking reject.
<s> You're a loser.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Why?
<s> Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
<s> Just giving the facts.
<s> You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
<s> Have you ever done this before?
<s> What?
<s> Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
<s> Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
<s> Any time fat boy!
<s> I can't do this.
<s> They won't figure it out.
<s> No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
<s> There is no candy!
<s> No...we want padded chairs...okay?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
<s> Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
<s> Sweet deal.
<s> Fish?
<s> Not tonight.
<s> Who's up for making some real money?
<s> That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
<s> Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
<s> Nobody knows.
<s> What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Isn't it a little late?
<s> You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> Moore?
<s> They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
<s> What? What's your point?
<s> What?
<s> You will not screw this up.
<s> Ball park sausages.
<s> Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
<s> It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
<s> I think so.
<s> Yes.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> He's quiet.
<s> Problems?
<s> I'm not. What's the problem?
<s> More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
<s> We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
<s> Not yet.
<s> We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
<s> No. Just like an hour or so.
<s> "At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
<s> After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
<s> I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
<s> She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
<s> What money?
<s> You put him down or don't bother coming back.
<s> You did all right dad.
<s> I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
<s> Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
<s> Buzzing?
<s> The wahoo?
<s> I think so.
<s> A move?
<s> Yup.
<s> Okay great. What will that be?
<s> What song?
<s> Drum banging real times.
<s> That's right.
<s> I KILLED MY BROTHER!
<s> I don't think that's a good idea.
<s> You'd like me to kill them?
<s> So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
<s> Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
<s> Who is she?
<s> I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
<s> Nothing. I didn't say anything.
<s> Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
<s> Whatever you like.
<s> Don't go!
<s> Yes, sir. Good night.
<s> Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
<s> And in the vegetable plot?
<s> Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
<s> Thank you; but it's missing something.
<s> Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
<s> Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
<s> If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
<s> There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
<s> Why?
<s> It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
<s> I know that you used to work with an architect.
<s> Leave him alone.
<s> You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
<s> No.
<s> What's he called?
<s> Are you sure it isn't contagious?
<s> Things seem to be getting better.
<s> Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
<s> Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
<s> This louse is looking for trouble.
<s> But, miss ...
<s> In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
<s> The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
<s> Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
<s> I'm only good at making people laugh.
<s> You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
<s> It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
<s> Why wasn't I told?
<s> But only you will know he's not human.
<s> If you can catch him.
<s> Where's my gun?
<s> You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
<s> On my life, I promise you I will.
<s> Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
<s> I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
<s> Only because I got pulled out early.
<s> If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
<s> You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
<s> Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
<s> I was assured the problem was corrected.
<s> I'M WHAT?!
<s> You're...such a wimp.
<s> This is supposed to be years away.
<s> What I need is a nymphomaniac.
<s> What's wrong with Parker?
<s> Then fix it.
<s> True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
<s> Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
<s> Help me get out of here.
<s> Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
<s> In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
<s> Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
<s> How did you get your hand out?
<s> You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
<s> I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
<s> Nothing.

<s> Now! Tell everyone to dump!
<s> Coulda been a contender.
<s> Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
<s> 50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
<s> Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
<s> No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
<s> Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
<s> Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
<s> So you're hot on this stock?
<s> Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
<s> ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
<s> Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
<s> ...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
<s> What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
<s> ...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
<s> Allright. Wait here...
<s> Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
<s> I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
<s> ...I can't make it tonight.
<s> Gordon.
<s> I gather you're a decorator.
<s> Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
<s> The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
<s> Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
<s> I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
<s> I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
<s> What the hell's that supposed to mean?
<s> Get the hell out!
<s> Why?
<s> Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
<s> No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
<s> ...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
<s> Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
<s> No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
<s> I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
<s> You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
<s> With Mark?
<s> Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
<s> Businessman!
<s> Yeah, yeah, OK
<s> But he still has something Mark hasn't.
<s> Thank you
<s> Thank you
<s> Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
<s> Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
<s> Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
<s> Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
<s> Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
<s> So Mark, what's so urgent?
<s> But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
<s> Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
<s> I'll come back all the time.
<s> Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
<s> No, he wouldn't.
<s> A ghost?
<s> No.  But once I heard...
<s> Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
<s> Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
<s> What does she look like?
<s> I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
<s> I am.
<s> No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
<s> Give me that shit.  Your wife.
<s> Um...yes.
<s> Is everything alright?
<s> Who?  Your husband?
<s> I can't, no, no, I can't...
<s> Please leave me alone.
<s> I came in from my room...
<s> I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
<s> Why does everyone find that so surprising?
<s> Okay, I'm a little tender.
<s> Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
<s> I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> The planchette?
<s> It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
<s> Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
<s> If she was dangerous before--
<s> Like what?
<s> Did he say that?
<s> What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
<s> We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
<s> Don't.
<s> I am, really.
<s> Not the focus.
<s> You are...
<s> We did.
<s> Nope.
<s> Shhh.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> More or less.
<s> To make sure she's all right.
<s> Unless you need me to come home...
<s> Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
<s> Well, that's nice.
<s> Huh.
<s> A flare?
<s> Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
<s> Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
<s> What can it hurt to talk to someone?
<s> He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
<s> Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
<s> Claire, please...
<s> Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
<s> You told me that I was...
<s> I...
<s> But I don't remember.
<s> It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
<s> Stop...
<s> Since when?
<s> STOP IT!
<s> So you fucked a student?!
<s> What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
<s> Who?
<s> It's alright.
<s> Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
<s> But why would they do that...?
<s> Come.  There is a lot to read
<s> Michael, Rowan should -
<s> Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
<s> I had you sent away.
<s> A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
<s> Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
<s> 'He'...?
<s> You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
<s> The door, Michael.  find the key...
<s> Anybody got a BP yet...?
<s> He just went out like & light-
<s> Like this...?
<s> It is from love.
<s> It's too soon to know.
<s> No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
<s> Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
<s> You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
<s> It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
<s> Rowan...
<s> Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
<s> You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
<s> And whose houses do you design...?
<s> Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
<s> Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
<s> Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
<s> Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
<s> You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
<s> God knows, I'm intriguing.
<s> What about you coming down here...?
<s> Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
<s> - a witch.
<s> Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
<s> Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
<s> Hello..
<s> He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
<s> No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
<s> Mm-hmmm...
<s> I love you too.
<s> A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
<s> Lock the door.  Lock it
<s> I don't know.
<s> What were you talking about...?
<s> Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
<s> It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
<s> You can't just -
<s> If you like that type.
<s> Just don't fall off any ladders.
<s> You really love this guy...?
<s> Is that a crack about our singing...?
<s> Papers...?
<s> I'm sorry - I didn't think
<s> Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
<s> BRIAN...
<s> Yes - I have had it for years.
<s> Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
<s> No she didn't...
<s> You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
<s> I don't know...
<s> I have something I have to show you...
<s> I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
<s> STEPHANIE?
<s> Then make it stop...
<s> I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
<s> Nothing could be better...
<s> No thanks - 
<s> CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
<s> Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
<s> No - I'll have you after
<s> At 2.00...
<s> No he had to - he's just - he's out...
<s> At home alone - where were you?
<s> Get out...
<s> No worries
<s> Yes...?
<s> Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
<s> Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
<s> You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
<s> Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
<s> Well, Dad said...
<s> Maybe he got promoted.
<s> This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
<s> I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
<s> Yeah, whatever.
<s> Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
<s> It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
<s> With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
<s> Oh, god.  Look. Look.
<s> Jealousy is so unattractive.
<s> Ladies first.  I insist.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
<s> You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
<s> I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
<s> Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
<s> Just say it, Dad.
<s> It's okay. You need me?
<s> I will not have my boys arguing.
<s> I always knew there was more. I felt it.
<s> Of course we were.
<s> If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
<s> Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
<s> What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
<s> You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
<s> Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
<s> You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
<s> I didn't forget.
<s> It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
<s> Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
<s> That's not ENTIRELY true.
<s> Interesting.
<s> Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
<s> I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
<s> And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
<s> You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
<s> I doubt it.
<s> Your dad taught you everything.
<s> A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
<s> Eventually you'll let go.
<s> You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
<s> You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
<s> Maybe someday.
<s> That's hard to believe.
<s> Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
<s> You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
<s> The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
<s> I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
<s> I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
<s> No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
<s> What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
<s> Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
<s> Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
<s> Thanks, Principal Merkin.
<s> Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
<s> I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
<s> A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
<s> Seldom? No kidding?
<s> Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
<s> Yeah.  Everything's cool.
<s> I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
<s> Really? You'd do that for me?
<s> I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
<s> You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
<s> What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
<s> She still work there?
<s> I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
<s> Take your time.
<s> No.
<s> She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
<s> Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
<s> You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
<s> It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
<s> You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
<s> You don't think Sam could've put it there?
<s> And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
<s> And what do they say?
<s> Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
<s> I wanna go home now.
<s> I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
<s> You and Suzie used to come out here together?
<s> Oh, for Christ's sake.
<s> Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
<s> I think we just need to get wasted.
<s> Police -- God -- get a life.
<s> I'm not on your property!
<s> Hi, Mon.
<s> I would hardly say you look like trash.
<s> I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
<s> I won't.
<s> In back of the garage.
<s> Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
<s> Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
<s> Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
<s> That's not your line.
<s> I love you.  Now give me the line.
<s> You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
<s> Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
<s> Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
<s> Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
<s> I did.  At Blue Balls.
<s> About what?
<s> That's right.
<s> Sit down, Lombardo.
<s> But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
<s> We?
<s> Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
<s> Can't.  Got a passenger.
<s> I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
<s> To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
<s> So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
<s> Jim West.
<s> You need that real often?
<s> Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
<s> Aha?
<s> Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
<s> It's a repeating steam cannon!
<s> What way is that?
<s> I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
<s> Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
<s> Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
<s> Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
<s> Of course not.
<s> I'm sure we will.
<s> My Lord, he was telling the truth!
<s> Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
<s> Really?
<s> I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
<s> Would that include me?
<s> Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
<s> Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Nicely said, sir.
<s> I deal with some tough customers.
<s> Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
<s> Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
<s> That would be... the Mexican War?
<s> It is?
<s> Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
<s> They're not after me.  They want the baby.
<s> Then come with us.
<s> Yes...?
<s> What is Tir Asleen?
<s> Not today, Willow.
<s> I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
<s> Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
<s> Are you okay?
<s> I hate this.
<s> Absolutely!
<s> Elora Danan!
<s> My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
<s> Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
<s> Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
<s> What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
<s> No!
<s> What do I need for that?
<s> As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
<s> I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
<s> The limitless power of...
<s> Shhhhh!
<s> There's nobody here.
<s> Surrender!!
<s> Me neither!
<s> Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
<s> I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
<s> No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
<s> Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
<s> I can't see anything--she's too bright!
<s> The sorceress.
<s> Good, you start tomorrow.
<s> Guess I'm not used to so much.
<s> John, I don't understand any of this.
<s> Pretty much.
<s> Okay, Mr. Book.
<s> It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
<s> Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
<s> I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
<s> Sure have, Sam.
<s> Oh, he's good.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Who else knows?
<s> Johnny 
<s> Don't try me, Johnny!
<s> Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
<s> I was wrong.
<s> What?
<s> You tell him. When you're able.
<s> Hochmut?
<s> I know what he said.
<s> Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
<s> I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
<s> I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
<s> Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
<s> There was.
<s> Aren't you? After today?
<s> Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
<s> Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
<s> Say again?
<s> Wrong.
<s> He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
<s> I don't know where he is.
<s> You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
<s> No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
<s> Tight. But I'm working on him.
<s> You might have killed him!
<s> My son is out there!
<s> Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
<s> Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
<s> Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
<s> Oh, I hope we got them in time.
<s> Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
<s> If she...
<s> Is morally, ethic'ly
<s> Who are you?
<s> Goodbye, folks!
<s> All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
<s> That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
<s> The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
<s> No, I'm afraid I didn't.
<s> But, how do I start for Emerald City?
<s> Toto, too.
<s> How did you guess?
<s> Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
<s> Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
<s> Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
<s> Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
<s> Stop her!
<s> Did you say something?
<s> Oh...
<s> ...Oh, did that hurt?
<s> I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
<s> The nerve.
<s> Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
<s> Hah!
<s> Not nobody, not nohow!
<s> I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
<s> Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
<s> Huh?  What'd he say?
<s> It's pleasant down that way, too.
<s> They would?
<s> Where's Kansas?
<s> You're going to see a Wizard?
<s> To Oz?
<s> Yes --- there.
<s> Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
<s> I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
<s> Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
<s> Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
<s> Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
<s> It's too late!  There they....
<s> You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
<s> Ah --
<s> I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
<s> Who at?
<s> What was that?
<s> Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
<s> Imposserous!
<s> She - she can have my Witch Remover.
<s> I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
<s> Don't push!
<s> Ohhhh -- it's me!
<s> It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
<s> Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
<s> Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Well, I --
<s> You promised us real things -- a real...
<s> Th.D.?
<s> This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
<s> With this?
<s> Then its no longer a bomb?
<s> I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
<s> Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
<s> Like riding a bike.
<s> We cant.
<s> I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
<s> Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
<s> Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
<s> The inside man?
<s> Indeed.
<s> Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
<s> Funerals arent exactly memorable.
<s> Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
<s> Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
<s> I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
<s> No. Youll be safe here.
<s> I have to go to work.
<s> You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
<s> Not at that price. Time to surrender.
<s> Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
<s> You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
<s> Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
<s> Whats your business with Elektra King?
<s> You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
<s> Where?
<s> To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
<s> Your father...
<s> How would you know?
<s> What do you think?
<s> What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
<s> The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
<s> Wrong answers?
<s> Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
<s> Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
<s> I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
<s> You're the only human being I care for.
<s> I won't do that.
<s> Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
<s> If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
<s> Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
<s> The missing scientists.
<s> Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
<s> What if youre wrong??
<s> You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
<s> Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
<s> Damn straight!  We were heroes.
<s> Maybe not, but why take chances?
<s> I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
<s> -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
<s> What are you up to?
<s> Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
<s> Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
<s> The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
<s> With lots of ketchup?
<s> What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
<s> Am I free to go?
<s> I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
<s> I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
<s> Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
<s> Maybe I'll do that.
<s> Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
<s> The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
<s> A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
<s> ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
<s> Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
<s> You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
<s> Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
<s> Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
<s> Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
<s> Yes it does.
<s> If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
<s> You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
<s> Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
<s> You wanna check it out? Come here.
<s> Naturally.
<s> He gets to be the hero.
<s> Yorgi asked me to.
<s> Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
<s> I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
<s> I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
<s> When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
<s> Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
<s> Let me.
<s> That's would be me.
<s> I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
<s> That one I'm real familiar with.
<s> It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
<s> Alright, so I'll get more.
<s> Yeah, thanks a lot.
<s> You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
<s> Is this what you're looking for?
<s> This is a gift. From me to you.
<s> Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
<s> You wanna see my politics?
<s> How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
<s> I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
<s> Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
<s> Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
<s> What's that?
<s> Into the Hudson?
<s> I wanted to talk to you.
<s> You know, you --
<s> What if they're naughty?
<s> He's busy right now.
<s> I've seen a lot of rings.
<s> I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
<s> Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
<s> INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
<s> Let's just say, God works too slowly.
<s> I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
<s> I'll go.
<s> They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
<s> Victor Frankenstein.
<s> Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
<s> What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Is it that music?
<s> MMmmm.
<s> Of course.
<s> Oh, nice.
<s> You're incorrigible!
<s> Goodbye, darling!
<s> That's my good boy.
<s> A week.  Ten days at most.
<s> The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
<s> One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
<s> Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
<s> Dr. Fronkonsteen!
<s> How old are you, young man?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> No.
<s> Wockers with the knockers???
<s> Just putting up some tea.
<s> Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
<s> He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
<s> This guy means business.
<s> Wait till he sees the bill.
<s> I'm not trying to be funny.
<s> ... I'm glad that's...
<s> Can you play it?
<s> Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
<s> That sound good, boss.
<s> Is everything ready?
<s> MMmmm!  MMmmm!
<s> Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
<s> No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
<s> Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
<s> Perhaps we'd better leave.
<s> And look at this, Doctor!
<s> I thought it was wonderful.
<s> I think I'll...carry him.
<s> Stop -- singing!!!
<s> No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
<s> Why don't we talk inside?
<s> MMmmm.
<s> MMMMmmmmm!
<s> His schwanzstucker.
<s> Do Something!  Stall them!
<s> Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
<s> Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
