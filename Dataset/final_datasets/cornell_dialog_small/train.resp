<s> Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
<s> Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
<s> Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
<s> Where?
<s> I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
<s> Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
<s> What crap?
<s> I hope so.
<s> They do not!
<s> No.
<s> Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
<s> Expensive?
<s> Hopefully.
<s> Queen Harry?
<s> It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
<s> It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
<s> I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
<s> I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
<s> You did what?
<s> After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
<s> No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
<s> You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
<s> Never
<s> Just sent 'em through.
<s> So they tell me...
<s> Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
<s> You burn, you pine, you perish?
<s> Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
<s> Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
<s> They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
<s> I thought you hated those people.
<s> Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
<s> It's her favorite band.
<s> Yeah -- we'll see.
<s> So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
<s> She kissed me.
<s> Not at all
<s> What do you think?
<s> You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
<s> How much?
<s> Fine, thirty.
<s> Fifty, and you've got your man.
<s> Do what?
<s> Does this conversation have a purpose?
<s> Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
<s> An attempted slit.
<s> I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
<s> I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
<s> Oh, right.  Friday.
<s> You know who The Raincoats are?
<s> Funny, you're the only one
<s> I told you
<s> Sure, I do
<s> Who?
<s> I hate him.
<s> What?
<s> But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
<s> He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
<s> BIANCA
<s> You 're so --
<s> Unwelcome.
<s> Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
<s> I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
<s> For. . . ?
<s> No what?
<s> So I have to have a motive to be with you?
<s> It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
<s> I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
<s> Because I like to torture you.
<s> I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
<s> Then tell them I had a seizure.
<s> Yeah.  I guess.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Good enough.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm likin' you guys better
<s> No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
<s> With the teeth of your zipper?
<s> Touch of the flu.
<s> Tumescent!
<s> Pirate -- no question.
<s> Dr. Ruth?
<s> Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
<s> I find that hard to believe.
<s> I don't want you to wait for me.
<s> Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
<s> Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
<s> Yes... I remember...
<s> Appointment to what?
<s> There'll be a time.
<s> This time with me!
<s> Not bad.
<s> Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
<s> Thousands.
<s> You did the same to your God!
<s> Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
<s> I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
<s> I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
<s> Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
<s> Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
<s> Give me absolution.
<s> You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
<s> My horse doesn't work.
<s> He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
<s> Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
<s> Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
<s> No, he is here.  Shit...
<s> What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
<s> What else do you need?
<s> Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
<s> Divorced.
<s> ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
<s> You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
<s> It was my decision, not his.
<s> I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
<s> A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
<s> I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
<s> Yeah.
<s> When?
<s> Stay with her.
<s> This isn't homicide school.
<s> Something back home?
<s> Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
<s> How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
<s> Then do it, asshole.
<s> You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
<s> I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
<s> Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
<s> Alright?
<s> I'm not.
<s> Answer it.
<s> Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
<s> Tonight.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
<s> Jesus Christ.
<s> That's unique.
<s> I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
<s> What?  It doesn't work that way.
<s> I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
<s> Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
<s> Don't want to film this?
<s> Surprise!  Surprise!
<s> A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
<s> You want the tape?  There it is!
<s> What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
<s> Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
<s> Thanks.  Appreciate it.
<s> He's my collar!
<s> He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
<s> Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
<s> A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
<s> Oh yeah, why?
<s> He knew all along.
<s> There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
<s> Aren't you tired?
<s> But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
<s> Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
<s> I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
<s> We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
<s> Sure, what is it?
<s> Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
<s> Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
<s> I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
<s> He's got a point.
<s> I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
<s> I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
<s> Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
<s> Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
<s> Yes, Daddy.
<s> Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
<s> Well, where are all of you off to?
<s> Well, that does sound very odd.
<s> Yes, very pleasant.
<s> Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
<s> You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
<s> Certainly.
<s> How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
<s> Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
<s> Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
<s> I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
<s> True.
<s> Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
<s> There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
<s> Roger.
<s> I want to pick up my car.
<s> Hammond.
<s> Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
<s> And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
<s> Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
<s> Yeah, i been waiting three years.
<s> I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
<s> Now you're talkin'. See ya...
<s> Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
<s> I don't think you're gonna make it.
<s> It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
<s> What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
<s> What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
<s> Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
<s> Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
<s> She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
<s> You have a good time?
<s> Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
<s> You need five years training to handle a joint like...
<s> What are you talkin' about?
<s> My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
<s> Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
<s> While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
<s> Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
<s> ...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
<s> If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
<s> You sure that's the reason?
<s> Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
<s> I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
<s> I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
<s> Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
<s> If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
<s> Partnership?
<s> You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
<s> They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
<s> Shit.
<s> Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
<s> I'm heading out. How about you?
<s> I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
<s> You're hopeless.
<s> I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
<s> Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
<s> What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
<s> That's the way I see it, too.
<s> You sure you want me to?
<s> Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
<s> No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
<s> So what?
<s> What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
<s> Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
<s> Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
<s> That's what I always say.
<s> How would you know?
<s> In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
<s> Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
<s> Naw, right here's okay.
<s> San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
<s> ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
<s> No thank you.
<s> I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
<s> Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
<s> What kind of mission?
<s> Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
<s> That's what I'm saying.
<s> One more reason to shoot first eh?
<s> Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
<s> Thank you, Mr. President.
<s> Yes. Of course..
<s> Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
<s> Who?
<s> I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
<s> Don't exist bud.
<s> ...'Scuse me?
<s> Vito Cornelius?
<s> ...Leeloo.
<s> You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
<s> I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
<s> This is a police control action..
<s> Crystal.
<s> Not without Leeloo.
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> Fuck it! Hold tight!
<s> I've had enough good news for today
<s> What is it?
<s> Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
<s> Apipoussan!
<s> OK, you can turn around!
<s> ...The rain falls...
<s> I'm so tired...
<s> Because...
<s> I love you...
<s> The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
<s> You gotta push the little yellow button...
<s> Actually only one cell survived..
<s> This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
<s> There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
<s> Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
<s> I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
<s> Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
<s> Mrs. Christian.
<s> Dino...
<s> And they are?
<s> Machine.
<s> Machine's in?
<s> Where are the women?
<s> What are you... ?
<s> Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
<s> You betrayed us.
<s> Why don't they come to me?
<s> I'm not so sure about this.
<s> I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
<s> You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
<s> I don't know...
<s> You enjoy it?
<s> I'm listening.
<s> That's right.
<s> Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
<s> Yeah... guess so.
<s> Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
<s> You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
<s> Sounds good, pops.
<s> Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
<s> Interesting theory.
<s> I don't know, where are yours?
<s> I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
<s> Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'll do whatever I can to help.
<s> Do you want to tell me what you found?
<s> I'm here.
<s> For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
<s> You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
<s> Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> Will you let me look?
<s> Who is this... ?
<s> No... no... no...
<s> Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
<s> You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
<s> Those are her belongings.
<s> That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
<s> None too discreet, is he?
<s> Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
<s> But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> It was bad.
<s> Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
<s> Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
<s> Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
<s> It's okay, we're just about there.
<s> You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
<s> Save it for later.  Come on!
<s> Alright, I think I see salvation...
<s> I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
<s> She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
<s> She knew she was gonna die.
<s> About Freddy?
<s> Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
<s> Your distraught.  It'll help...
<s> Oh God!  He killed them!
<s> Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
<s> What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
<s> How did you know that?
<s> Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
<s> It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
<s> No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
<s> No.  A deal's a deal.
<s> You sure you don't want a ride to work?
<s> Alice...
<s> But Dad --
<s> Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
<s> When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
<s> I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
<s> Krueger is reality.
<s> What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
<s> That's the only reason you're alive...
<s> Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
<s> I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
<s> Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
<s> Well we gotta do something!
<s> I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
<s> Mark!
<s> My baby!
<s> That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
<s> She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
<s> Makes you look like a nun--
<s> Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<s> You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
<s> Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
<s> Huh?
<s> A lot of people think like that.
<s> Right at our one-eyed friend!
<s> Yes, Griff?
<s> What about time...?
<s> Under <u>water</u>?
<s> Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
<s> <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
<s> As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
<s> That's what I said!
<s> Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
<s> Your friend was to remain where he was!
<s> I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
<s> Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
<s> Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
<s> This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
<s> Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
<s> Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
<s> You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
<s> Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
<s> In the chest.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I don't want to.
<s> I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
<s> Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
<s> Grandpa. My father. It's his.
<s> I know.
<s> Where's the plow?
<s> What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
<s> I figured you already heard.
<s> Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
<s> You want me to follow them to Littleton?
<s> Maybe.
<s> Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
<s> Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
<s> Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
<s> Yeah, lots.
<s> Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
<s> I know who it is.
<s> Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
<s> You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
<s> But not now.
<s> Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
<s> Wade.
<s> There's a furnace.
<s> Jack?
<s> No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
<s> A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
<s> Twombley.
<s> Who?
<s> No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
<s> What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
<s> No thanks. I don't drink.
<s> They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
<s> A hunting accident is perfect.
<s> I'm sure he's busy.
<s> Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
<s> Did we warn them off?
<s> Got it.
<s> Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
<s> Lemme take a look.
<s> This doesn't make sense.
<s> We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
<s> I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
<s> Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
<s> Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
<s> My loyalty was never to my country.
<s> About goddamn time.
<s> Roger.
<s> Dead.
<s> Nine.
<s> why did they do that?
<s> Well it worked.
<s> Stand by.
<s> Tower, here.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Come on, Alice.
<s> Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
<s> Yes
<s> You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
<s> Gravity.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> That isn't necessary.
<s> Can't it wait?
<s> Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
<s> No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
<s> You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
<s> But...
<s> This is the President.
<s> You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
<s> Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
<s> DO YOU SEE TEEM?
<s> We're hooked. Hove into position.
<s> That just doesn't make any sense.
<s> Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
<s> Commissioner, Aquarius.
<s> Yes I did...
<s> There's nothing wrong with me!
<s> Who's that, Ted?
<s> I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
<s> We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
<s> Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
<s> There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
<s> That was very well put, Ted.
<s> Compute!
<s> Maybe.
<s> I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
<s> You can do it from up here, Captain.
<s> No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
<s> Negative.
<s> Scraps.
<s> A b...
<s> Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
<s> Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
<s> Yes.
<s> Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
<s> You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
<s> Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
<s> Don't try to stop me!
<s> I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
<s> Thank you. Cream?
<s> Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
<s> Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
<s> Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
<s> Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
<s> Well...not for another two hours.
<s> I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
<s> I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
<s> It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
<s> But if you'll just give me...
<s> I remember everything. All I have are memories.
<s> Headquarters!? What is it?
<s> Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
<s> ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
<s> ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
<s> Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
<s> Yes?
<s> The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
<s> Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
<s> Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
<s> That's right.
<s> Yes...
<s> I am George.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
<s> And still it fits?
<s> Did you learn anything?
<s> Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
<s> You are married?
<s> I appreciate your honesty, George.
<s> Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
<s> George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
<s> Why?
<s> Thank you.
<s> You must leave me alone on this.
<s> Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
<s> We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
<s> ... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
<s> Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
<s> You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
<s> Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
<s> Departmental policy.
<s> Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
<s> Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
<s> I got him.  Don't get pinned.
<s> Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
<s> Yes.  That follows.
<s> PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
<s> Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
<s> Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
<s> Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
<s> If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
<s> Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
<s> Bullshit!
<s> Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
<s> Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
<s> We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
<s> So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
<s> Shut up.  Just shut up!
<s> They're but off!  Do something!
<s> All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
<s> Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
<s> Alive?
<s> Fuckin' A!
<s> On my way.
<s> Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
<s> But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
<s> All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
<s> No.  Have you?
<s> Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
<s> How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
<s> No.. I've slept enough.
<s> What about me?
<s> You promise?
<s> The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
<s> I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
<s> Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
<s> Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
<s> Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
<s> At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
<s> Good morning.
<s> Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
<s> A Turkish brothel.
<s> My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
<s> What??
<s> Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
<s> Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
<s> Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
<s> Who the devil are you? What do you want?
<s> We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
<s> No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
<s> What?
<s> Eat
<s> You borrowed money from your mother?
<s> No!
<s> I love you! I love you!
<s> Wolfi! Your father is dead.
<s> Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
<s> Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
<s> No, sir. This is my own idea.
<s> Tonight?
<s> No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
<s> He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
<s> Gertrude!
<s> Ah, now! Here she comes.
<s> Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
<s> Your Highness.
<s> Of course not.
<s> It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
<s> Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
<s> Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
<s> Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
<s> Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
<s> Enchanted, Madame.
<s> Ah! By all means.
<s> Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
<s> Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
<s> Ah, love again.
<s> Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
<s> Well. There it is.
<s> I will.
<s> Am I not welcome?
<s> Don't you have a maid?
<s> This is just a game, Papa.
<s> I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
<s> No one calls you that.
<s> Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
<s> Do any pupils come to the house?
<s> I don't know. He has pains.
<s> I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
<s> Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
<s> What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
<s> And which one of them do you want me to teach?
<s> Madame.
<s> Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
<s> It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
<s> You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
<s> What exactly are you working on?
<s> I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
<s> Thank you! Oh, thank you.
<s> I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
<s> What dead? Who is dead?
<s> Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
<s> This is only a vaudeville.
<s> The doctor thinks I am. But -
<s> Finish what?
<s> Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
<s> Consigned to flames of woe.
<s> What time?
<s> I think so.
<s> Certainly, Herr Director.
<s> Mozart -
<s> Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
<s> Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
<s> In the sight of God that is a sin.
<s> My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
<s> I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
<s> You cannot say that!
<s> His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
<s> I did.
<s> Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
<s> Italian?
<s> Incredible.
<s> Well done, Sire!
<s> Did we?
<s> Excuse me, my dear.
<s> Show her in. Then go to bed.
<s> He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
<s> They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
<s> Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
<s> Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
<s> Is David acting strangely?
<s> Yes?
<s> Please, really. I'm not hungry.
<s> How is that?
<s> I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
<s> I dream of death mostly.
<s> That's not really a very proper question.
<s> Twenty-eight.
<s> Shall I read to you?
<s> No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
<s> I would think so.
<s> Lovely.
<s> Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
<s> A doper werewolf.
<s> Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Why on earth do you say that?
<s> Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
<s> Oh, come on, tell us.
<s> You could have told them!
<s> What time is it?
<s> Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
<s> You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
<s> You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
<s> I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
<s> Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
<s> I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
<s> Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
<s> I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
<s> You ask them.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Pecos Bill.
<s> This is too much. I can't handle this.
<s> What?!
<s> David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
<s> Yes.
<s> David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
<s> You must believe me.
<s> Hi, David.
<s> Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
<s> Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
<s> No.
<s> Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
<s> I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
<s> It was more than that last week.
<s> It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
<s> Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
<s> I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
<s> That's very simple. I was home.
<s> Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
<s> They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
<s> But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
<s> Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
<s> I haven't got it.
<s> Why, I needed a
<s> Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
<s> Well
<s> Well, aren't you going to invite me?
<s> Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
<s> A misunderstood bachelor.
<s> Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
<s> You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
<s> This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
<s> Of course, let them in! You're late now.
<s> It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
<s> But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
<s> Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
<s> In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
<s> I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
<s> Now don't you worry about it.
<s> Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
<s> And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
<s> Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
<s> The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
<s> Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
<s> Don't you think I know it?
<s> Oh, is that so?
<s> Oh, ten dollars
<s> Yeah, swell.
<s> He was here?
<s> Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
<s> Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
<s> You stay out of this, Bob.
<s> What have you done?
<s> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<s> Swear.
<s> Oh no...
<s> They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
<s> Best damn plan I heard all war.
<s> Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
<s> Hey!
<s> Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
<s> What?
<s> Tell me.
<s> I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
<s> Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
<s> You're not scared, are you?
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> So what do we do, General Lee?
<s> I got three.
<s> Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
<s> A trap.
<s> You ride like a Comanche.
<s> Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
<s> Shakespeare.  He's European.
<s> All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
<s> It's a secret.
<s> Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
<s> Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
<s> Heard of him.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
<s> Ma.
<s> Jesse, we're outlaws.
<s> It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
<s> I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
<s> We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
<s> If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
<s> Nuh-huh ...
<s> No! I mean, of course not. No.
<s> What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
<s> A river pirate.
<s> Me neither.
<s> When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
<s> That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
<s> Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
<s> Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
<s> What?
<s> You are a hell of a woman.
<s> I'm not hanged yet.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
<s> I hope I'm not being too forward.
<s> They had to be dealt with!
<s> Move you fools!
<s> Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
<s> I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
<s> We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
<s> I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
<s> Oh, that's the best part.
<s> I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
<s> No.
<s> Can you put men at all four?
<s> Vengeance.
<s> What? Oh, I'm...busy.
<s> Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
<s> I'm thinking Dorsia.
<s> Take it off.
<s> You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
<s> Yes?
<s> No-I can't take the time off work.
<s> I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
<s> We never really shared one.
<s> I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
<s> Oh God, I can't believe this.
<s> No, he doesn't.
<s> There was no ad in the Times.
<s> Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
<s> Yes, naturally.
<s> But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
<s> But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
<s> No, you...didn't?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
<s> I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
<s> I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
<s> Oh really? That's great.
<s> When?
<s> Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
<s> Can you bring Mr...
<s> No, come on. Anywhere you want.
<s> Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
<s> I'm on a diet. But thank you.
<s> No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
<s> No, not really.
<s> Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
<s> Jean? Hello? Jean?
<s> No. Flattering, but no.
<s> I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
<s> Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
<s> No. I really don't.
<s> Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
<s> Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matine of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
<s> Uh huh?
<s> He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
<s> You're at Paul Owen s.
<s> Paul Owen.
<s> No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
<s> Who do you ask?
<s> He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
<s> No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
<s> It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
<s> 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
<s> Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
<s> Wait. That's not what I've got.
<s> But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
<s> And?
<s> Marcus?
<s> Where was Marcus?
<s> It's cold out, too, isn't it?
<s> I'm not...
<s> What am I gonna do?
<s> Al.
<s> Yeah, well, you're late.
<s> Yes, Owen?
<s> What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
<s> They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
<s> Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
<s> If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
<s> We're not gonna let it.
<s> Milo! What about --?
<s> You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
<s> Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
<s> You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
<s> You can't just walk in, either.
<s> ...Whaddo I do?
<s> Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
<s> He has thousands of employees, Milo --
<s> Milo, you --
<s> I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
<s> Look at me! I'm gonna change.
<s> It's gonna get cold.
<s> No.
<s> He wasn't acting?
<s> ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
<s> I am. I am, sir.
<s> It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
<s> You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
<s> You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
<s> Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
<s> He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
<s> Maybe I'm going too fast.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Were the flags for Teddy?
<s> Talk about work? Never!
<s> 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
<s> ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
<s> I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
<s> I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
<s> Just do it.
<s> You do?
<s> Keep looking.
<s> They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
<s> I'm calling Gary.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
<s> Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
<s> Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
<s> Certainly not at my happy home.
<s> A what?
<s> 'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
<s> But you said the other --
<s> Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
<s> What?!
<s> Jesus, Teddy.
<s> I didn't plan this.
<s> You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
<s> I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
<s> You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
<s> We won, Austin.
<s> Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
<s> My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
<s> Thank you, Exposition.
<s> Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
<s> What?
<s> That's not your mother, that's a man!
<s> I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
<s> Yes, Basil?
<s> Yes Basil?
<s> Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Here, use mine.
<s> Why?
<s> I couldn't have another bite.
<s> Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
<s> I am not.
<s> Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
<s> Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
<s> Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
<s> Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
<s> Indeed.
<s> Lay it on me.
<s> That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
<s> Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
<s> I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
<s> Where did you learn to shoot?
<s> In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
<s> Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
<s> Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
<s> My son?
<s> It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
<s> They're mutated sea bass.
<s> We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
<s> Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
<s> Yeah. What?
<s> Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
<s> Blow me.
<s> Show me.
<s> I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
<s> Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
<s> I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
<s> Well, it's kind of weird.
<s> OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
<s> OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
<s> Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
<s> There are limits?
<s> No need. I'll call again.
<s> ... love ...
<s> Sir August...?  What now?
<s> We have met ...
<s> This isn't a game.
<s> Rules are made to be broken.
<s> Then who wins?
<s> You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
<s> The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
<s> Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
<s> But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
<s> Valentine, listen to me ...
<s> You're mad.
<s> Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
<s> What are my choices?
<s> I'll never marry you.
<s> And just what is the game?
<s> Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
<s> Mother?
<s> We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
<s> Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
<s> As per mother's instructions.
<s> After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
<s> An eccentric recluse?
<s> Frankly that's how I remember it.
<s> Very good, Steed ...
<s> Is that written in his shoe?
<s> Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
<s> Orders.
<s> Keeping a stiff upper lip?
<s> Not for a moment.
<s> Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
<s> Winning isn't everything.
<s> You don't trust me?
<s> You lied.
<s> Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
<s> Why's he called 'Invisible'?
<s> Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
<s> Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
<s> Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
<s> I see.
<s> Surveillance? By whom?
<s> Getting to what?
<s> I fail to see --
<s> You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
<s> She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
<s> Guilty until proven innocent?
<s> I feel sure of it.
<s> Perish the thought.
<s> Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
<s> Bobbie, what are you talking about?
<s> I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
<s> Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
<s> Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
<s> He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
<s> Ooh, be still, my heart.
<s> Yes I did.
<s> Sure have...
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
<s> I'm going now, Cole.
<s> But a fabulous cook.
<s> Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
<s> About what?
<s> Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
<s> You better not have too much joy.
<s> How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
<s> Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
<s> Let's get naked.
<s> Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
<s> Ilene, we don't really know that.
<s> What are you talking about, asshole?
<s> What are you...
<s> Gary, you're quite an animal.
<s> Milt?
<s> Larry, you and your wife got problems?
<s> Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
<s> Ha, ha, ha.
<s> It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
<s> Can't I just maim it a little?
<s> Rick!
<s> The phone made me do it!
<s> Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
<s> Olivier's in that, right?
<s> Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
<s> Got me.
<s> Very.
<s> Take care.
<s> Who's your friend?
<s> You got it.
<s> You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
<s> Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
<s> Yeah...
<s> Stevie... I...
<s> My Lt. might have something to say about that.
<s> Not likely.
<s> -- C'mon, Stephen.
<s> What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
<s> Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
<s> You got a problem with drilling, probie?
<s> Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
<s> Everybody did.
<s> I know.
<s> What are we going to do about this?
<s> You look great.
<s> So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
<s> Yeah? What have you been up to?
<s> Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
<s> Homey.
<s> Hi.
<s> Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
<s> -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
<s> You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
<s> Pest control.
<s> What?
<s> But he killed these guys.
<s> Fire.
<s> Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
<s> How ya feeling?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
<s> You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
<s> No need to be modest, Brian.
<s> Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
<s> Backdraft.
<s> Management were pin heads.
<s> Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
<s> -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
<s> In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
<s> Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
<s> McCaffrey, hold this for us.
<s> Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
<s> Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
<s> I know you.
<s> Investigator Rimgale.
<s> I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
<s> You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
<s> He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
<s> Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
<s> Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
<s> Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
<s> What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
<s> Let me think about it.
<s> Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
<s> I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
<s> Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
<s> Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
<s> Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
<s> It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
<s> B-L-A-K it is.
<s> I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
<s> Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
<s> Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
<s> Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
<s> What are you talkin' about?
<s> Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
<s> You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
<s> My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
<s> Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
<s> We was coming to see you.
<s> To what?
<s> Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
<s> No costume.  No blackface.
<s> Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
<s> I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
<s> ...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
<s> I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
<s> I'm wid it.
<s> So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
<s> It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
<s> Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
<s> What are there character traits?
<s> I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
<s> They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
<s> The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
<s> Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
<s> I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
<s> How did you end up here?
<s> I didn't mean that, in life.
<s> Always keep 'em laughing.
<s> Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
<s> You getting cold feet?
<s> And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
<s> Hello.
<s> Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
<s> The pleasure is mine.
<s> Everybody shut up.
<s> This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
<s> It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
<s> To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
<s> You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
<s> Give me the gun.
<s> Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
<s> Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
<s> Same thing Giuliani said.
<s> Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
<s> Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
<s> Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
<s> It looks delicious.
<s> I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
<s> It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
<s> Soon.
<s> Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
<s> Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
<s> ...the big apple, New York, New York.
<s> You tellin' the truth.
<s> ...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
<s> You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
<s> I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
<s> Never read a book in my whole life.
<s> Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
<s> After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
<s> And what?
<s> You can go now.
<s> If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
<s> I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
<s> I never was more in earnest.
<s> It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
<s> How do you do, sir?
<s> Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
<s> The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
<s> It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
<s> The coward!
<s> Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
<s> Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
<s> I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
<s> The gentleman has nothing contraband.
<s> No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
<s> Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
<s> Certain?
<s> What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
<s> That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
<s> It is my only object.
<s> Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
<s> Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
<s> We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
<s> Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
<s> Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
<s> Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
<s> The Prince left him only that choice.
<s> Yes, papa.
<s> Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
<s> Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
<s> You know that was like a quadruple negative?
<s> Fine.
<s> Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
<s> Can anybody hear me!
<s> We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
<s> Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
<s> What do you mean, alone?
<s> I just don't like it.
<s> C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
<s> They're dead, aren't they?
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm not telling you what happened.
<s> This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
<s> He's lying.
<s> Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
<s> Do what?
<s> Epilepsy.
<s> No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
<s> One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
<s> We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
<s> How do you know that?
<s> You hated West more than any of us.
<s> Just look. Little pocket.
<s> Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
<s> That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
<s> They?
<s> But not the only victim, right?
<s> I didn't kill him --
<s> Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
<s> I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
<s> Stop.
<s> How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
<s> So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
<s> Well?
<s> Maybe --
<s> Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
<s> Well, he's a good soldier.
<s> The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
<s> Who killed Pike?
<s> That's horseshit and you know it.
<s> The Senator...
<s> I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
<s> You knew Sergeant West?
<s> Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
<s> Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
<s> See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
<s> I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
<s> You're right. We should sit in silence.
<s> Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
<s> I lost a bet.
<s> The very same.
<s> I lied. Wait for it...
<s> I don't think that has anything to do with --
<s> Watch me.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
<s> Good, just making sure.
<s> Isn't this how your story goes?
<s> Hardy, for Chrissakes --
<s> Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Poor fucker my ass...
<s> Fifty minutes.
<s> The fuck are you talking about --
<s> He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
<s> He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
<s> I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
<s> We know.
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
<s> That's great.
<s> Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
<s> Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
<s> Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes.
<s> The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
<s> No one's ever left.
<s> Fine, I'm doing it.
<s> Was she nekkid?
<s> Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
<s> I'm not convinced you should be happy.
<s> I see. I thank you for your time.
<s> Lucky girl.
<s> You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
<s> No, I understand.
<s> Can I take your picture?
<s> I never knew.
<s> Oh, so this is a tall tale?
<s> You were talking about your wedding.
<s> I like your stories.
<s> Really?
<s> That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
<s> No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
<s> You think I'm up for it?
<s> No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
<s> I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
<s> Oh, so you know.
<s> I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
<s> The river?
<s> You say...
<s> Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
<s> I have the rest of my life to find out.
<s> I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
<s> You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
<s> Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
<s> We'll have to pick up a copy.
<s> I'll help you.
<s> Did you?
<s> Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
<s> But it's not true.
<s> You're not.
<s> Of course.
<s> Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
<s> No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
<s> Yes?
<s> I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
<s> We'll stop then.
<s> You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Oh.  We are Russian.
<s> Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
<s> Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
<s> What?
<s> Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
<s> No. It is too judgmental.
<s> I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
<s> Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
<s> What? What does he want?
<s> I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
<s> He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
<s> Yes.
<s> Syevodnya
<s> You don't understand anything.
<s> It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
<s> I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
<s> So you're just going to be vindictive
<s> What? No you're not..
<s> It's none of your business.
<s> Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
<s> He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
<s> Why not?
<s> And. It's wrong.
<s> Why?
<s> Get out.
<s> Thank Christ for that.
<s> What was her name?
<s> No. I think I better just go.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Okay. Promise?
<s> I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
<s> Cash.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> You hurt it?
<s> Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
<s> You liked what I brung ya?
<s> Yeah. Transmission's shot.
<s> They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
<s> You been home yet?
<s> You need a ride?
<s> It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
<s> I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
<s> Let go of my arm...
<s> Careful how you point that gun, boy.
<s> Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
<s> You sayin' you'll do what?
<s> BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
<s> How long... how long I been out?
<s> Get this Goddamn thing off me!
<s> Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
<s> The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
<s> You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
<s> I CAN'T!
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Itches.
<s> I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
<s> I don't fuckin' cook.
<s> I ain't in a hurry.
<s> You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
<s> You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
<s> Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
<s> What I love.
<s> I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
<s> Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
<s> She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
<s> Don't know if God wanna see me.
<s> This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
<s> Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
<s> Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
<s> Ask the chef.
<s> Not like that.
<s> We ain't here to talk about that shit.
<s> Yes'sir.
<s> So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
<s> You could put it that way.
<s> Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
<s> Rae don't do this now...
<s> Ronnie. Please, baby...
<s> You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
<s> What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
<s> Charlie...
<s> Where is the subway station, please.
<s> Hey, when in Rome --
<s> I'd feel better if we had some heat.
<s> Give me a break, would you?
<s> Where would you look for the mafia?
<s> That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
<s> What's the problem here?
<s> Give us a break...
<s> Why weren't you at the platform?
<s> Yeah...
<s> I can see that.
<s> You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
<s> If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
<s> Ichiro --
<s> Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
<s> Shut-up.
<s> San is an honorable title.
<s> A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
<s> No.
<s> Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Yes...
<s> Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
<s> We can't lose.
<s> There was a change in plans.
<s> You have a helluva way of asking for help.
<s> Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
<s> He's on duty.
<s> It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
<s> You met her.
<s> What do you chant?
<s> The cheese...
<s> What if I chant?
<s> I'm amused.
<s> What...?  What if I say no?
<s> Why me?
<s> He killed a police officer.
<s> Why don't you ask your chief detective?
<s> For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
<s> If anything happens to her while I'm here --
<s> The families who control the casinos?
<s> Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
<s> He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
<s> We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
<s> Can the maker repair what he makes?
<s> Death.
<s> Come here.
<s> Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
<s> I am?
<s> Like what?
<s> Just thought I'd...
<s> Hello, glad to meet you.
<s> There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
<s> What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
<s> Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
<s> Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
<s> Why, yes, of course.
<s> I know all that.
<s> Do you have something against science?
<s> My pleasure.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm doing okay.
<s> Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
<s> No.  I got a problem.
<s> Yes?
<s> Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
<s> I think you need more help than you've got.
<s> Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
<s> I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
<s> Like?
<s> Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
<s> I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
<s> You mean a woman?
<s> Go ahead.
<s> If she is, the machine works.
<s> How do you know I'm not?
<s> Don't move.
<s> But how come I'd be there?
<s> I keep a lot of provisions right here.
<s> You like it?
<s> Thank-Q!
<s> I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
<s> Young man, stop right there!
<s> It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
<s> What is it?!
<s> I haven't brushed yet.
<s> Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
<s> It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
<s> No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
<s> Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
<s> A wife?
<s> You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
<s> Two weeks.
<s> Of course.
<s> He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
<s> Sure.
<s> Uh...yeah.
<s> So, what are you seeing?
<s> Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
<s> Look unimpressed.
<s> Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
<s> You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
<s> I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
<s> Eve, I'm sorry.
<s> Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
<s> What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
<s> Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
<s> Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
<s> Well, you had better!!
<s> No.
<s> Yes, Eve?
<s> Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
<s> It was at least as good as the sky.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> They're pretty.  Can I have them?
<s> Gerade aus dann links!
<s> Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
<s> It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
<s> No. Sit down.
<s> Why?
<s> Then why go there?
<s> It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
<s> You nut!
<s> 1959.
<s> How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
<s> Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
<s> Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
<s> I'm not wearing his pants.
<s> Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
<s> How old do I look?
<s> I guess living up here makes people look older.
<s> You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
<s> How do you do, ma'am.
<s> Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> I'll go up.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> A psychiatrist?!
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
<s> Yeah.
<s> "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
<s> Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
<s> I never know anymore.
<s> I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
<s> Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
<s> Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
<s> Yes, dear!
<s> No.
<s> No, Calvin, you're favorite.
<s> Would you like a tranquilizer?
<s> No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
<s> Hi.
<s> If he tells, it won't come true!
<s> Yes...
<s> Yes, dear, I know.
<s> Some time.
<s> Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
<s> Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
<s> Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
<s> Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
<s> It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
<s> He left with Sophie.
<s> Coward!
<s> Then what?
<s> What?!
<s> None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
<s> Where?!
<s> You bet, Mom! Coming up!
<s> Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
<s> Roger, Wolf One.
<s> No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
<s> Okay honey.
<s> Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
<s> I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
<s> It's blue. Blue velvet.
<s> Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
<s> Nobody.
<s> You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
<s> No. Come on.
<s> Nothing. Are you alright?
<s> I'll go then.
<s> Yes.
<s> See my nipples?
<s> Yes, I like you.
<s> Yeah, hurry up though.
<s> That's not crazy. I like you too.
<s> Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
<s> I sure don't hate you.
<s> Kiss me.
<s> Just get outta my bed.
<s> No, it's not Don.
<s> You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
<s> Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
<s> It's okay. It's okay.
<s> Don? Where is he?
<s> I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
<s> 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
<s> My bourbon.
<s> Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
<s> Speak to me Fucker.
<s> No thanks. What does that mean?
<s> Nothing.
<s> This is it.
<s> Jeffrey, when you see your father.
<s> You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That sounds great!
<s> Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
<s> Hey Jeff.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah. What are you doing now?
<s> I don't know. He moved away.
<s> I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
<s> Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
<s> Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
<s> Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
<s> That's what I thought.
<s> I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
<s> Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
<s> Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
<s> No.
<s> What is it?
<s> Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
<s> Let's wait for some slow one.
<s> No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
<s> No Jeffrey!!
<s> Stop it Mike.
<s> Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
<s> Aye.
<s> Any tips on where these guys may be?
<s> Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
<s> What happened?
<s> Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
<s> I-I'll tip her.
<s> I know what the fuck he looks like!
<s> You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
<s> I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
<s> BLAME...
<s> Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
<s> What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
<s> We... met them last night.
<s> An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
<s> We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
<s> Aye.
<s> No pictures, either.
<s> What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
<s> Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
<s> Yes, we are.
<s> Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
<s> So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
<s> It is your corrupt we claim.
<s> With every breath we shall hunt them down.
<s> You... oh god, why?
<s> It was... It was...
<s> The fat man.
<s> Eight.
<s> Who were the victims?
<s> Hallelujah, Jaffar.
<s> Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
<s> I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
<s> Well, what'ya do?
<s> Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
<s> Y-Yes my son.
<s> You feel?
<s> Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
<s> Just go!
<s> Right. The blond guy.
<s> Dignan, it's --
<s> He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
<s> As part of his plan. I don't know why.
<s> That sets it off.
<s> Eight dollars.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
<s> We know there's another stocker.
<s> We got it. We got it.
<s> Because my mom gets the bill.
<s> I don't want to use it.
<s> You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
<s> I'll say it.
<s> Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
<s> Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
<s> No. We didn't.
<s> No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
<s> No kidding.
<s> Where was it parked?
<s> This morning.
<s> Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
<s> I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
<s> No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
<s> OK.
<s> I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
<s> I know that. But --
<s> That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
<s> Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
<s> Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
<s> Take your second position.
<s> Good. It's supposed to be.
<s> It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
<s> Nobody move!
<s> Let's go. Come on.
<s> I'll see you there.
<s> I'll get him.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
<s> Dignan, I --
<s> Dignan, I --
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't want to die.
<s> Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
<s> It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
<s> See you, Bob.
<s> There's a million places to hide around here.
<s> I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
<s> He looked too shaken-up.
<s> I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
<s> I'm not playing any more golf.
<s> No, I don't mind.
<s> That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
<s> No. I wasn't adopted.
<s> Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
<s> No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
<s> I didn't do anything.
<s> Cuba.
<s> God, yes. Like silk.
<s> You're Anthony?
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Is that Buckethead?
<s> True.
<s> Bob! Get back in position!
<s> I thought your parents were in Italy.
<s> What are you talking about, Bob?
<s> You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
<s> I can't believe you said that.
<s> I told you he's crazy.
<s> I warned you, Dignan.
<s> I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
<s> His name was Swifty?
<s> That's true. That would give me nightmares.
<s> It's registered in my mother's name.
<s> You're the one who kept saying ram him.
<s> Come on, Dignan.
<s> I'm going back.
<s> What is it?
<s> Not bad.
<s> I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
<s> I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
<s> I know it, man. Hang on.
<s> I think so.
<s> I didn't think there was an alarm.
<s> 26 weeks.
<s> He's damn good.
<s> We're just going over a few things.
<s> Who? Applejack?
<s> In the cash register. Step away from the door.
<s> No, my friend knows her.
<s> You Hoto?
<s> It's locked.
<s> There was a mistake.
<s> Will it track back to us?
<s> One last push. One.
<s> Bourne comes here? Why?
<s> Never heard of it.
<s> He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
<s> What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
<s> And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
<s> Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
<s> It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
<s> Don't know.
<s> I'm sorry, Ward.
<s> 'Why' would be enough for me.
<s> And Danny Zorn, what was that?
<s> The sooner the better.
<s> What?
<s> Is this really happening?
<s> Sorry. Old habits.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I did.
<s> -- take the back -- get another car --
<s> No. There's nothing new.
<s> Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
<s> I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
<s> We can't wait to be sure.
<s> -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
<s> What?
<s> But you found another choice.
<s> It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
<s> Yes.
<s> Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
<s> I killed him???
<s> No. You never worked Berlin.
<s> I was here!
<s> There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
<s> Careful...
<s> But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
<s> Here?
<s> Me? Four years.
<s> Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
<s> You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
<s> You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
<s> What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
<s> It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
<s> No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
<s> He will. I know he will.
<s> You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
<s> ...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
<s> Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
<s> You mock us with a smile?
<s> Fourteen? --
<s> My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
<s> The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
<s> That depends on the man.
<s> Humbly, M'lord.
<s> Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
<s> I... accept your proposal!
<s> You scare me.
<s> Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
<s> And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
<s> I am trying.
<s> Aye. But it won't let me dream.
<s> Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
<s> So what did you find.
<s> The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
<s> But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
<s> Okay.
<s> Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
<s> Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
<s> How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
<s> Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
<s> You need to see the prison shrink, man.
<s> Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
<s> I thought you were a December baby.
<s> Like Ozzy.
<s> Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
<s> You really don't remember anything that happened?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
<s> Wow. That must've taken some courage.
<s> Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
<s> Go on. Sit down.
<s> I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
<s> No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
<s> He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
<s> It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
<s> Thumper had a busy afternoon.
<s> Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
<s> Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
<s> My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
<s> If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
<s> What's wrong with you?!
<s> Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
<s> Huh?
<s> None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
<s> I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
<s> I thought I was the bad guy!
<s> Oh my God oh my God...
<s> You're such a retard!
<s> Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
<s> I came with Captain Renault.
<s> I thought so. Where's your husband?
<s> Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
<s> In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
<s> Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
<s> I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
<s> Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
<s> Come up here a minute.
<s> I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
<s> It has been a pleasure to meet you.
<s> Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
<s> Suppose we do.
<s> And the carrying charges?
<s> Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
<s> Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
<s> Well, so long.
<s> Good day.
<s> You needn't be concerned about me.
<s> How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
<s> And I was wondering.
<s> I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
<s> No, no, no, no. We must leave.
<s> -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
<s> I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
<s> Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
<s> Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
<s> It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
<s> -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
<s> Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
<s> And Laszlo?
<s> But what about us?
<s> And I said I would never leave you.
<s> Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
<s> Won't you join us?
<s> -- Yes?
<s> Of course, I'll be careful.
<s> Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
<s> Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
<s> My office.
<s> What of it?
<s> Keep it. You'll need it in America.
<s> Yes. What is it you want?
<s> Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
<s> No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
<s> Very well.
<s> No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
<s> We'll be there.
<s> I slept very well.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
<s> Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
<s> Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
<s> I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
<s> Champagne and a tin of caviar.
<s> How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
<s> Why? What's in Lisbon?
<s> What, again?
<s> Yeah? Have a brandy?
<s> Yeah? What's his name?
<s> Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
<s> It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
<s> Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
<s> He'll take one.
<s> And got well paid for it on both occasions.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
<s> That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
<s> What friend?
<s> I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
<s> I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
<s> I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
<s> You think of everything, don't you?
<s> Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
<s> What is your nationality?
<s> -- You thought what?
<s> For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
<s> I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
<s> Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
<s> Not right now.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, boss?
<s> Uh, my watch stopped.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Worse than Warsaw.
<s> Catch another fish tomorrow.
<s> Do too much, I'll die.
<s> Take it.
<s> Survive today, that's the point.
<s> If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
<s> They're harder to do than they look.
<s> Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
<s> Not if you work for FedEx.
<s> He's your cute thing.
<s> No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
<s> I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
<s> Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
<s> Hey...hey...it's okay!
<s> I would have done the same thing.
<s> That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
<s> Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
<s> Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
<s> Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
<s> Not when you have no choice.
<s> Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
<s> You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
<s> So did I.
<s> Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
<s> Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
<s> What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
<s> Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
<s> We're on.
<s> Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
<s> Want to see my raft?
<s> Time I had lots of.
<s> What?
<s> Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
<s> He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
<s> I'm *not* a doctor!
<s> I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
<s> I doubt it. She's just an...
<s> Two.
<s> No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
<s> Really?
<s> It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
<s> When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
<s> You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
<s> It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
<s> Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
<s> So we should "wait and see." For how long?
<s> Fine. That's all there is to it then.
<s> Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
<s> You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
<s> No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
<s> Please don't...
<s> Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
<s> I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
<s> Yes, I *have*!
<s> No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
<s> Well, this *is* an orphanage.
<s> Nobody's asked for me, have they?
<s> You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
<s> *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
<s> She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
<s> Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
<s> Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
<s> It's okay--I don't mind.
<s> Have you enlisted?
<s> You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
<s> Oh, I would love that, Wally.
<s> Right.
<s> Okay...
<s> What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
<s> This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
<s> You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
<s> One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
<s> That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
<s> I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
<s> You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
<s> Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
<s> Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
<s> Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
<s> You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
<s> Why was he missing for twenty days?
<s> They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
<s> Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
<s> You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
<s> Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
<s> She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
<s> It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
<s> That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
<s> On me. For the seat. Cheers.
<s> No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
<s> A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
<s> Sort of like a letter of intent.
<s> The standard ten.
<s> Two million.
<s> We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
<s> Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
<s> My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
<s> It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
<s> Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
<s> We're going to give him the money back?
<s> People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
<s> Jake, I mean, come on --
<s> We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
<s> Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
<s> She's up for it.
<s> You sure?
<s> What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
<s> What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
<s> We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
<s> You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
<s> I think two million.
<s> Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
<s> Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
<s> Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
<s> Help me.
<s> You interested in a little work?
<s> I'll worry about Customs.
<s> Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
<s> What?
<s> It's what I do. It's my job.
<s> It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
<s> You sure we're clear?
<s> Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
<s> How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
<s> Wait a second... Who's the mope?
<s> Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
<s> Escorts!
<s> Do you have a ticket?
<s> Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
<s> In over your head?
<s> It's not history.
<s> I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
<s> Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
<s> We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
<s> Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
<s> We're here.
<s> That's it?
<s> Whoa, whoa... There he is.
<s> That's what I'm talking about.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> It's the tension.
<s> I can imagine.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Seven-fifty.
<s> Who was he?
<s> You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
<s> Tension. It'll go.
<s> It's only hair. I haven't changed.
<s> What about a drink on the way home?
<s> -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
<s> Never. Why do you ask?
<s> Then what?
<s> I want to buy a car.
<s> It's not that.
<s> So why did you come to my casino?
<s> Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
<s> What kind of trouble?
<s> Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
<s> It won't.
<s> What about my neck?
<s> No thank you.
<s> It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
<s> Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
<s> Who did it? Tell me!
<s> Are you going to put a spell on me?
<s> Too much. Eighteen hundred.
<s> Over the river.
<s> No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
<s> What the fuck are you talking about?
<s> Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
<s> That bitch? No.
<s> No thanks.
<s> I'd like to buy you a drink.
<s> I put them on together.
<s> Give me 365.
<s> They've been tested.
<s> What happens if I want to sneeze?
<s> I said good call.
<s> Yes.
<s> Very impressive.
<s> A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
<s> Bruised.
<s> Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
<s> I think he's talking to it.
<s> The key!
<s> Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
<s> It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
<s> Time to start talking.
<s> Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
<s> He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
<s> Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
<s> Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
<s> I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> Of course.
<s> All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
<s> To explode, of course.
<s> Of course not.
<s> I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
<s> I have no proof that it was false data.
<s> Mafhkin oble groop...
<s> Doolittle...
<s> Any of 'em any good?
<s> Fred.
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
<s> I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
<s> ...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
<s> Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
<s> Yes, Talby, what is it?
<s> Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
<s> Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
<s> No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
<s> Phenomenology...
<s> You didn't tell me you lived with her.
<s> Where?
<s> You mean until you showed up?
<s> Justine was not an unwilling participant.
<s> She was there...
<s> And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
<s> It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
<s> Police drone.
<s> So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
<s> It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
<s> And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
<s> Every week.
<s> Girl's gotta make a living.
<s> We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
<s> Logan Cale.
<s> Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
<s> People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
<s> I won't be staying.
<s> Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
<s> You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
<s> My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> Look, thank you for this but--
<s> To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
<s> How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
<s> You did.
<s> Here's your money.
<s> You and me both.
<s> I just don't go in with any expectations.
<s> Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
<s> Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
<s> Where?
<s> And because he's my friend.
<s> And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
<s> They're prisoners to their genes.
<s> But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
<s> I'll bet you can.  Sit.
<s> What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
<s> I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
<s> What if he's on the level?
<s> But I'll take a rain check...
<s> Max--
<s> I was on call. 
<s> I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
<s> How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
<s> Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
<s> Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
<s> I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
<s> Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
<s> Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
<s> You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
<s> Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
<s> What's in Sandusky?
<s> Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
<s> Check!
<s> I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
<s> Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
<s> Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
<s> Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
<s> The easy way.
<s> It's my Bullworker.
<s> Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
<s> NOW!
<s> It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
<s> Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
<s> If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
<s> Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
<s> You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
<s> Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
<s> Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
<s> Not if I shoot first!
<s> Yeah.
<s> So... that's it?
<s> If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
<s> When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
<s> Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
<s> You'll know soon enough.
<s> Take it off. I want to see you.
<s> That's easy. Antiseptics.
<s> Why is that?
<s> You want to kiss me...
<s> No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
<s> And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
<s> What's wrong with you?
<s> Hey. You OK?
<s> Where is she?
<s> But you're OK?
<s> No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
<s> We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
<s> Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
<s> That is a terrible nickname.
<s> It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
<s> Do they know yet?
<s> I guess she just lost faith in the world.
<s> Why should we care?
<s> Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
<s> I don't own a television.
<s> Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
<s> No.  That's stupid.
<s> Yes.
<s> I met a girl.
<s> Gretchen. We're going together now.
<s> I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
<s> No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
<s> I know.
<s> Have you ever made love, Donald?
<s> I... I was playing with fire.
<s> If God exists?
<s> I have the power to build a time machine.
<s> I was just being honest.
<s> Her name is Gretchen.
<s> Okay, but it has to be a small one.
<s> Come again?
<s> You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
<s> You're not a bitch.
<s> You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
<s> Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
<s> He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
<s> How did you know --
<s> But now you can't go.
<s> Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
<s> I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
<s> My mom wanted me to have this?
<s> Your parents'd kill you.
<s> Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
<s> Yah?
<s> Huh?
<s> Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
<s> Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
<s> Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
<s> Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
<s> Yes...
<s> NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
<s> I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
<s> Loretta, shut it.
<s> I got a hairdo.
<s> Anyone?
<s> She's the winner and we're going to state.
<s> My dress'll reek.
<s> Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
<s> What?
<s> Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
<s> A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
<s> I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
<s> Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
<s> Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
<s> I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
<s> I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
<s> Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
<s> He should be king!
<s> The king can do no wrong! 
<s> We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
<s> "My"...
<s> I'll have to enclose the check first.
<s> If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
<s> Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
<s> You was insulted, but you don't know it.
<s> We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
<s> I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
<s> Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
<s> We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
<s> Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
<s> If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
<s> You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
<s> Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
<s> Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
<s> Yes.
<s> No, that wasn't it...
<s> No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
<s> Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
<s> He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
<s> I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
<s> But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
<s> Now -- er --
<s> Why -- why -- of course.
<s> Take a seat -- you're next. 
<s> The king can do no wrong!
<s> Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
<s> Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
<s> I didn't come here to be insulted.
<s> With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
<s> How lovely.
<s> No, I think a whiskey.
<s> I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
<s> I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
<s> Do you?
<s> ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
<s> I'll get my bag.
<s> Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
<s> Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
<s> Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
<s> Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
<s> I feel much better. Thank you.
<s> Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
<s> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
<s> I am very pleased to meet you.
<s> You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
<s> O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
<s> Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
<s> It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
<s> No, but I certainly shall.
<s> You're English.
<s> Yes.
<s> Thank you... very much.
<s> I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
<s> Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
<s> My name is...
<s> Say "Mmmerrick."
<s> Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
<s> Yes.
<s> How is your tea, John?
<s> Oh yes.
<s> Good morning.
<s> Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
<s> You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
<s> Yes.
<s> Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
<s> John.... how can you ever forgive me?
<s> Yes, very soon.
<s> Then I shouldn't change anything?
<s> I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
<s> I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
<s> Ah! It's my father!
<s> There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
<s> These? What are THESE? They're swords.
<s> Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
<s> What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
<s> And I thought you said it was something special...
<s> Five this week; how many the week before?
<s> Who?
<s> But, Erik...
<s> Why?
<s> No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
<s> Goodbye, Aud...
<s> No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
<s> I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
<s> I... but I...
<s> Not quite...
<s> But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
<s> I shouldn't have come.
<s> I see the world.
<s> Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
<s> They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
<s> I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
<s> Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
<s> Yes... oh, yes...
<s> You DON'T like it, do you?
<s> But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
<s> And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
<s> Ah.
<s> You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
<s> He was lucky...  Sit there.
<s> Very deep... usually...
<s> Sorry!
<s> Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
<s> ROW!
<s> What "magic"?
<s> You'll see!
<s> We don't HAVE to help anybody.
<s> So?
<s> Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
<s> Oh... I feel a little... oh...
<s> Who gets killed?
<s> Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
<s> Keitel Blacksmith?
<s> But how could he know... unless...
<s> I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
<s> It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
<s> Over the Edge of the World.
<s> I have to go...
<s> Bye... sorry...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
<s> Well... I... I thought...
<s> How can we stops him now?
<s> She knows it was our fault!
<s> Like you got rid of Snorri!
<s> Not now, Sven...
<s> It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
<s> Dad!
<s> You liar!
<s> Yes, Mother.
<s> Yes, Mum.
<s> I told you that later.
<s> Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
<s> I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
<s> I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
<s> Okay, I guess.
<s> Well, I didn't want to assume.
<s> Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
<s> Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
<s> Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
<s> I don't know any jokes about your name.
<s> Well, anyway... Sorry.
<s> Probably see you at the book store.
<s> No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
<s> I don't want to take you out of your way.
<s> It's okay. I didn't think you were.
<s> Sort of, um...
<s> Well, I wouldn't want to be --
<s> Very much.
<s> Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
<s> No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
<s> Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
<s> It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
<s> I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's scary sounding.
<s> I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
<s> ...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
<s> Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
<s> No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
<s> I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
<s> Yeah, Tangerine?
<s> I don't know.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
<s> Naomi, I guess.
<s> I'll buy that. Black's always good.
<s> So what. Infatuation is good, too.
<s> And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
<s> I'm Joel.
<s> I know.
<s> Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
<s> I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
<s> I love her.
<s> I think she's great.
<s> Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
<s> Seems too coincidental that way.
<s> I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
<s> Oh, um...
<s> Well, you obviously don't know me.
<s> Says you were a bully...
<s> That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
<s> Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
<s> I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
<s> Oddly enough, I do.
<s> I guess so.
<s> I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
<s> Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
<s> There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
<s> It's too late.
<s> Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
<s> I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
<s> Well... I did.
<s> No. I just need some space, maybe.
<s> It's not somebody else.
<s> I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
<s> Hi, Mary. How's it going?
<s> Nah, I don't know.
<s> Very cool. Trippy.
<s> I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
<s> I better do this, Stan.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Where?
<s> Hi.
<s> They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
<s> Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
<s> Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
<s> Welcome, Howard.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Alexander Pope?
<s> It's no big deal.
<s> We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
<s> It was a mutual decision.
<s> He went home sick.
<s> December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
<s> That's fine, Stan.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Then check the connections.
<s> It's a quote book.
<s> Patrick, we're in the middle of --
<s> Easy come, easy go.
<s> Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
<s> Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
<s> FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
<s> She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
<s> She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
<s> Well.... er...
<s> I have to go, Julian.
<s> American Cheese. The king of road food.
<s> When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
<s> Tired...
<s> I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
<s> Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
<s> Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
<s> I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
<s> Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
<s> You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
<s> I'll get him.
<s> You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
<s> Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
<s> No, he didn't.
<s> It is not.
<s> I don't know, the screens are dead...!
<s> You're okay now, it's over...
<s> Hurry.
<s> "Another man?" Who?
<s> No.
<s> I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
<s> It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
<s> Hear what?
<s> Nothing. It's nothing.
<s> A power drain --
<s> Pressure?
<s> He's crashing...
<s> You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> The dark inside me.
<s> "The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
<s> How do you know all this?
<s> That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> Justin. I won't let you die.
<s> The crew? Could they still be alive?
<s> No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
<s> I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
<s> Starck, you still showing those readings?
<s> ...you okay?
<s> Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
<s> Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
<s> They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
<s> It's complicated...
<s> I don't know...
<s> Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
<s> Son of a bitch!
<s> I'm not the Devil.
<s> Better if I just show you.
<s> NOOO!
<s> ...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
<s> Love to.
<s> We don't have time to fart.
<s> You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
<s> We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
<s> She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
<s> Justin?
<s> Let's go.
<s> We're all here.
<s> But you can breathe it.
<s> How much oh-two do we have?
<s> Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
<s> No. It was someone else.
<s> "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
<s> There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
<s> You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
<s> I did.
<s> Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
<s> Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
<s> We're losing atmosphere...
<s> All boards are green, everything's five by five.
<s> Range 3000 meters and closing.
<s> No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
<s> The forward airlock.
<s> It means nothing.
<s> You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
<s> Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
<s> My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
<s> I like the sound of that.
<s> Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
<s> Oh, he did.
<s> I'm worried about you.
<s> Ben. This is business. Just work.
<s> Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
<s> External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
<s> Five times.
<s> Should?
<s> Well maybe you should date him.
<s> Ben. Are you okay?
<s> Got it, teach.
<s> Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
<s> Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
<s> Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
<s> Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
<s> The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
<s> I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
<s> Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
<s> Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
<s> They're not costumes.
<s> But all these people...
<s> Dude. That's my sister.
<s> Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
<s> It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
<s> History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
<s> That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
<s> I was talking about us. Working together.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
<s> I gave him twenty.
<s> Ben did this.
<s> He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
<s> Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<s> I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
<s> Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
<s> For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
<s> I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
<s> I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
<s> Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
<s> See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
<s> Sis.
<s> Your friends use the pool too.
<s> They're not home yet.
<s> Where did you hear that?
<s> Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
<s> Why?
<s> See you later.
<s> Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
<s> Oh, really?
<s> Well...
<s> I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
<s> I know it's yours.
<s> It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
<s> Damone, you gotta listen to me.
<s> No.
<s> No. It's too soon.
<s> Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
<s> What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
<s> All right. Pay attention.
<s> I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
<s> I'm really pretty busy...
<s> Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
<s> Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
<s> Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
<s> I thought he was out of town.
<s> Then don't hassle it.
<s> All right.
<s> You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
<s> Should we buy a frame for that?
<s> Believe it.
<s> What's the big deal?
<s> It was okay.
<s> Climax together.
<s> I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
<s> You're right. I didn't tell you that.
<s> That little prick.
<s> There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
<s> Yeah, like maybe never.
<s> Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
<s> You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
<s> And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
<s> Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
<s> No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
<s> How about your phone number?
<s> Thanks. So do you.
<s> I don't know. Wherever you want.
<s> Thanks. Thanks a lot.
<s> It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
<s> Sure thing.
<s> Yeah. It's my sister's.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
<s> Do you want to come inside?
<s> Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
<s> Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Two Cokes.
<s> I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
<s> Yes... It makes sense.
<s> Not for me.
<s> You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
<s> Not where we operate.
<s> Naked.
<s> WHAT?
<s> Dobermans don't talk.
<s> You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
<s> They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
<s> Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
<s> No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
<s> Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
<s> Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
<s> And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
<s> God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
<s> If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
<s> Why what?
<s> Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
<s> It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
<s> Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
<s> What for?
<s> He told me he was turning in early...
<s> Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
<s> Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
<s> I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
<s> Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
<s> Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
<s> They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
<s> They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
<s> Me?
<s> It's gone too far.
<s> You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
<s> How much is the lemon meringue pie?
<s> Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
<s> Spare me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nah, I got the gun.
<s> Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
<s> Come on, come on.
<s> If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
<s> No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
<s> My truck.
<s> Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
<s> What's in the back?
<s> Magic potion.  You should try a little.
<s> How much I got, what?
<s> You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
<s> Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
<s> No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
<s> Two.
<s> Seven.
<s> Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
<s> HOLD THAT TIGHT!
<s> MOVE YOUR ASS!
<s> HELLLPPP!
<s> Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
<s> Nothing, just lookin'.
<s> She's not very nice, is she?
<s> That's fine.
<s> Not without you!!!
<s> All right.
<s> I'd love to.
<s> Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
<s> Um, well...
<s> This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
<s> Who's this?
<s> Very fine bone structure.
<s> Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
<s> But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
<s> I'd like nothing better.
<s> Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
<s> My clothes?
<s> It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
<s> Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
<s> Huh.
<s> I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
<s> Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
<s> I know, but --
<s> Right now we have to be practical.
<s> In my eyes, officer.
<s> Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
<s> GET OUT!
<s> Who?
<s> The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
<s> I know you believe that.
<s> I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
<s> Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
<s> We'll get you home, Frances.
<s> No.
<s> He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
<s> He's a socialist, then?
<s> They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
<s> Good.
<s> I wouldn't miss it.
<s> Are you an actor?
<s> Are you really serious? About acting?
<s> Then don't go to Hollywood.
<s> They'll mend.
<s> Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
<s> Not me. But other people seem to.
<s> Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
<s> Yeah, well --
<s> Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
<s> Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
<s> Harry.
<s> I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
<s> What?
<s> Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
<s> I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
<s> If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
<s> You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
<s> Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
<s> Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
<s> That's right.
<s> Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
<s> What's that?
<s> Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
<s> Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
<s> ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
<s> Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
<s> How did I look?
<s> Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
<s> Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
<s> I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
<s> Who're you?
<s> Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
<s> Yes, Ma.
<s> Mama, what's...
<s> Why are these all opened?
<s> You kill me, Mama.
<s> Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
<s> Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Not long.
<s> Yes, Mama.
<s> I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
<s> And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
<s> Thank you for understanding, Mama.
<s> But what -- 
<s> Don't I know you?
<s> Oh bullshit.
<s> You're telling me you feel guilty.
<s> Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
<s> She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
<s> But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
<s> Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
<s> Frances, I'm warning you...
<s> What is that to you? Evil as you are.
<s> What kindness?
<s> The music? Or the fire?
<s> Kill me and have done with it.
<s> Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
<s> Materials. Nothing more.
<s> I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
<s> Yes. I want this over and done with.
<s> What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
<s> She's not for you.
<s> SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
<s> And you look so lovely.
<s> It's been months. It's not like him.
<s> Fine.
<s> Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
<s> I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
<s> I'm all right. I'm safe,
<s> Now husband and wife.
<s> Open this door for no-one!
<s> Very well then.
<s> That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
<s> Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
<s> And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
<s> I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
<s> Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
<s> Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
<s> Good night, Brenda.
<s> I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
<s> Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
<s> Not if they're where I think they are.
<s> Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
<s> Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
<s> Somebody'll see.
<s> I need you so much, Claudette.
<s> Where'd you get that stuff?
<s> A short somewhere.
<s> God, but I love that sexy talk.
<s> I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
<s> Rocky Road.
<s> Sure.
<s> Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
<s> What's this about, money?
<s> That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
<s> Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
<s> Yes, they do.
<s> I was a minister.
<s> Yes.
<s> How do I know you'll keep your word?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
<s> I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
<s> To yours.
<s> You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
<s> Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
<s> I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
<s> Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
<s> No!
<s> Sure.
<s> Where are you taking us?
<s> What's in Mexico?
<s> What you said to me in the room.
<s> Yes.
<s> You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
<s> Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
<s> Daddy's dead.
<s> You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
<s> Later.
<s> He signaled the Ranger.
<s> I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
<s> -- This conversation is over.
<s> Or what?
<s> They broke when you fell.
<s> No, Richie, what do I look like?
<s> No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
<s> It don't look together.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, it's mine.
<s> Don't say my name.
<s> "Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
<s> Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
<s> -- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
<s> Standing right here in my office.
<s> "Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
<s> Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
<s> Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
<s> It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
<s> The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
<s> Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
<s> Sir?  What did he say?
<s> Smoke her.
<s> I'll act surprised.
<s> Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
<s> This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
<s> Yes, dear.
<s> Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
<s> Sounds familiar.
<s> Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
<s> The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
<s> I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
<s> I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
<s> I'll work on it, ma'am.
<s> If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
<s> Sir?
<s> You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
<s> You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
<s> Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
<s> You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
<s> Blank faces here, O'Neil.
<s> Just like you would be.
<s> I take it you don't either.  Feet.
<s> Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
<s> Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
<s> Me?  Why me?
<s> What about him.
<s> Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
<s> "Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
<s> Whose orders were those?
<s> And how do you know that?
<s> He was married?
<s> How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
<s> Sure, sure.
<s> I don't know...
<s> "Dad."
<s> We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
<s> Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
<s> Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
<s> Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
<s> O'Neil, Jordan.
<s> Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
<s> You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
<s> I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
<s> Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
<s> Oh yes he will.
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> Most people don't.
<s> Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
<s> I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
<s> Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
<s> Nick Tatopoulos.
<s> That's the problem. He did.
<s> Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
<s> This is not the place...
<s> Call me Charlie.
<s> Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
<s> Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
<s> Get your people out of there or I will.
<s> It's Tatopoulos.
<s> We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
<s> We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
<s> You don't have the authority to do that.
<s> I am not permitted to speak of such things.
<s> You were right.
<s> It's okay. I know her.
<s> It's Raymond.
<s> I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
<s> Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
<s> Is that the bathroom?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
<s> I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
<s> Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
<s> I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
<s> They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
<s> The guy is terminally selfish!
<s> Why didn't you stop at the market?
<s> Alex? Where are you going?
<s> Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
<s> It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
<s> Raise the glass and push the blue button.
<s> The enemy is matching velocity.
<s> No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
<s> All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
<s> That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
<s> What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
<s> Right.
<s> You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
<s> You... know us?
<s> The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
<s> Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
<s> BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
<s> Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
<s> We're doing episode 31?
<s> You smiled at me.
<s> One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
<s> Let me think. I need time to think.
<s> Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
<s> Computer, can it be repaired?
<s> Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
<s> Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
<s> Turn on the translation circuit.
<s> Right.
<s> TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
<s> This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
<s> That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
<s> Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
<s> Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
<s> No! I swear I don't know! Please!
<s> Thanks
<s> It's perfectly safe. I promise.
<s> NO, Thank God he has not.
<s> Our former Commander was not... Strong.
<s> I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
<s> Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
<s> But...Why?
<s> Oh god...
<s> Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
<s> It doesn't have eyes.
<s> It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
<s> Patience, Lt. . Patience.
<s> The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
<s> But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
<s> Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
<s> Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
<s> Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
<s> Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
<s> More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
<s> The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
<s> It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
<s> I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
<s> March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
<s> Who's in command out there?
<s> As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
<s> I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
<s> Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
<s> Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
<s> Gag on your own invention, then.
<s> I understand, George.
<s> A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
<s> They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
<s> I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
<s> I only meant...
<s> Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
<s> My God, what?
<s> Martha!  For God's sake!
<s> Yessir!
<s> It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
<s> Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
<s> Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
<s> You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
<s> Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
<s> I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
<s> You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
<s> But not more than your comfort.
<s> Really?  Which precious homily was it?
<s> Africa, of course.
<s> Or, 'civilized'.
<s> The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
<s> Well, we must be who we must be...
<s> I think I will disappoint you.
<s> Just because they are born?
<s> Who says so?
<s> That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
<s> Juba was a Numidian.
<s> You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
<s> Come here, Farrah...
<s> No. What's this?
<s> It's what he said, I'm his associate.
<s> That's right, me.
<s> Yeah, we're getting Martin.
<s> I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
<s> Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
<s> What?
<s> It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
<s> Bear, you're not really gonna -
<s> It's a different kind of deal.
<s> Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
<s> Chili Palmer showed you my script?
<s> Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
<s> Whatever you want, Ray.
<s> He owes me money.
<s> I don't like waiting.
<s> I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
<s> It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
<s> Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
<s> I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
<s> We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
<s> I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
<s> Harry, look at me.
<s> Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
<s> Who's the star?
<s> She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
<s> I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
<s> Read it. It's a grabber.
<s> You're kidding, right?
<s> I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
<s> You have it?
<s> Who?
<s> Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
<s> Personally?
<s> What Get Away jet?
<s> Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
<s> With what? Wiseguy money?
<s> Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
<s> Compass.
<s> How'd you know I was here?
<s> I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
<s> Sit down, Leo.
<s> I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
<s> Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
<s> Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
<s> Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
<s> Don't go out of your way.
<s> Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
<s> And you think the movie business is any different?
<s> Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
<s> Hey, Chili? Look at me.
<s> Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
<s> You're as bad as Harry...
<s> Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
<s> I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
<s> What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
<s> Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
<s> You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
<s> I'm going into the movie business.
<s> I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
<s> Be quiet and listen.
<s> Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
<s> 'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
<s> Yeah, Karen knows him.
<s> Thanks.
<s> A passenger liner. Over.
<s> Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
<s> Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
<s> With that coxswain dickhead.
<s> They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
<s> Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
<s> Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
<s> I don't know. Tuesday?
<s> Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
<s> Roger?
<s> Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
<s> Maybe he isn't alone.
<s> Like I always say --
<s> The right way and the wrong way.
<s> I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
<s> What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
<s> How about you Epps?
<s> Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
<s> And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
<s> Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
<s> What do you propose?
<s> You smashed it!
<s> Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
<s> Right.
<s> There's a charming thought.
<s> Sorry.
<s> I bet you did.
<s> He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
<s> Because of the gold.
<s> Better than starving to death.
<s> Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
<s> No cowboy shit. Right.
<s> Yup.
<s> Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
<s> I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
<s> Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
<s> What?
<s> If it was a ship she hit.
<s> Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
<s> He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
<s> Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
<s> Maybe it was more than that.
<s> It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
<s> The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
<s> Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
<s> Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
<s> So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
<s> Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
<s> Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
<s> You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
<s> Who?
<s> YES.
<s> God, how horrifying.
<s> I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
<s> What is it now?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
<s> Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
<s> It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
<s> Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
<s> I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
<s> So what do you think?
<s> Huh?
<s> What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
<s> But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
<s> Jesus...
<s> In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
<s> Oh my God, that's HIM!
<s> Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
<s> Hi.
<s> Why?
<s> "Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
<s> Hey Josh.
<s> You loser.
<s> How perfect.
<s> Just look at them!
<s> In fact, never.
<s> Can we call you "Weird Al"?
<s> I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
<s> God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
<s> Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
<s> God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
<s> I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
<s> He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
<s> We should follow him home.
<s> I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
<s> I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
<s> It'll only take a second.
<s> This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
<s> Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
<s> What? Where?!
<s> Where did you get that?
<s> You cunt!
<s> No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
<s> Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
<s> God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
<s> Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
<s> I can't afford stuff like this right now.
<s> I can't imagine spending money on towels.
<s> Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
<s> Do you still want to do something tonight?
<s> Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
<s> Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
<s> What are you doing here, Melorra?
<s> That's not even --
<s> So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
<s> NO!!!
<s> Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
<s> Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
<s> Oh my god! We have to go in here!
<s> Fine, I'll go by myself then...
<s> C'mon, Seymour, please?
<s> I'm not holding my breath in that department.
<s> Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
<s> But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
<s> What? Why?
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> I won't even dignify that with a response.
<s> Really?
<s> ...I better not...
<s> I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
<s> It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
<s> So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
<s> What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
<s> Does that mean you don't like me?
<s> I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
<s> Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
<s> Do you have anything to drink?
<s> I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
<s> I dunno, I...
<s> I will if you want to.
<s> I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
<s> They're Seymour's.
<s> Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
<s> I am.
<s> It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
<s> It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
<s> Why? What did she tell you?
<s> Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
<s> -malaria epidemic; very sudden.
<s> -you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
<s> Am I to take it you want to live?
<s> You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
<s> How could it be? I hate Africa.
<s> Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
<s> I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
<s> Then we agree. 
<s> We have hunted since childhood.
<s> I assure you we came close many times-
<s> He just gave me his "monster" speech.
<s> Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
<s> Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
<s> And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
<s> What?
<s> You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
<s> You mean nobody died?
<s> That's very considerate.
<s> No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
<s> Has it ever done that before?
<s> Have you ever failed?
<s> You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
<s> What happened to them?
<s> Don't they have to be?...
<s> I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
<s> This is more difficult-
<s> You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
<s> Thank you, Samuel.
<s> He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
<s> I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
<s> I don't believe you had a mother. 
<s> Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
<s> We don't have a relationship.
<s> Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
<s> I won't.
<s> I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
<s> Didn't I do it?
<s> Okay, that's no problem.
<s> There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
<s> Oscar!  You poor kid!
<s> Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
<s> Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
<s> Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
<s> I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
<s> For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
<s> Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
<s> Same difference.
<s> So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
<s> Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
<s> Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
<s> Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
<s> So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
<s> We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
<s> It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
<s> I await the word of Vigo.
<s> Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
<s> I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
<s> Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
<s> You need the exercise.
<s> Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
<s> Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
<s> I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
<s> And it's all flowing toward the museum.
<s> Dana!  Dana Barrett!
<s> Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
<s> Okay, let's heat 'em up!
<s> This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
<s> You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
<s> I hate Jello.
<s> Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
<s> We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
<s> The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
<s> I'm ready.
<s> Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
<s> To the bathroom, where do you think?
<s> No.  They're just coming to me.
<s> Eight o'clock?
<s> Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
<s> I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
<s> So what do you think it was?
<s> What?
<s> Out!
<s> I'll scream.
<s> I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
<s> Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
<s> I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
<s> You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
<s> Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
<s> There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
<s> I think it's the food of the future.
<s> I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
<s> Has this ever happened before?
<s> Because you didn't say the magic word.
<s> See!  They are using drugs.
<s> I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
<s> I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
<s> The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
<s> When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
<s> What have you got, Egon?
<s> I'm always serious.
<s> What is it?
<s> Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
<s> I agree.
<s> If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
<s> I blame myself.
<s> God, it's ugly!
<s> Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
<s> Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
<s> Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
<s> I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
<s> If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
<s> You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
<s> To go into business for ourselves.
<s> Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
<s> I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
<s> No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
<s> He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
<s> Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
<s> Mmmhmmm.
<s> Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
<s> And the seas would boil ...
<s> Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
<s> Right.  We'll believe anything.
<s> LATER, MAN!!
<s> What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
<s> Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
<s> I'm sure, I don't know.
<s> Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
<s> Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
<s> The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
<s> If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
<s> Gladly Caesar.
<s> How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
<s> We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
<s> Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
<s> Jerses -- tomorrow...
<s> This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
<s> That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
<s> Yes, because I know they'll read it.
<s> God of passages and changes?
<s> Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
<s> The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
<s> When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
<s> I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
<s> Why you?
<s> Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
<s> Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
<s> I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
<s> There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
<s> You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
<s> On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
<s> Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
<s> You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
<s> Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
<s> They're studying with Cynics.
<s> I can see that...
<s> I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
<s> I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
<s> No!
<s> You teach them!
<s> General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
<s> Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
<s> Chain him.
<s> Alive... I'm alive...
<s> Don't be ridiculous.
<s> What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
<s> No.
<s> I'm sorry I took you in there.
<s> Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. She had a husband and a son.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> That woman --
<s> Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
<s> GET OUT!
<s> Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
<s> Come in.
<s> What?
<s> What did she say?
<s> Elaine -- that is not what happened.
<s> All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
<s> -- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
<s> -- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
<s> The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I might.
<s> I have to go back now.
<s> Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
<s> Why wouldn't it?
<s> Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, Benjamin.
<s> Is the doctor anywhere?
<s> Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes I am.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm in the bathroom.
<s> All right. Put it in the room where we were.
<s> A room. I'd like a room, please.
<s> Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
<s> That's right.
<s> What?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
<s> Oh. Well, goodnight.
<s> I know that. But I'm --
<s> What if he did?
<s> Waiter!
<s> Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
<s> Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
<s> That's fine.
<s> Well -- do you want to go up first?
<s> The number.
<s> I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
<s> Either one will be fine.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> INADEQUATE!
<s> Well what do you want to talk about?
<s> How about art.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
<s> There's no risk?
<s> Calm down, Benjamin.
<s> We don't.
<s> I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
<s> That's enough.
<s> Then let's hear them.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> I see.
<s> Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
<s> Of course you did.
<s> Then give me your word you won't.
<s> Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
<s> I can makes things quite unpleasant.
<s> I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
<s> Yes, but I'm afraid --
<s> Sure.
<s> Goodnight, Benjamin.
<s> About an hour ago.
<s> -- worried?
<s> What about it?
<s> I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
<s> No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
<s> No. She doesn't know about it.
<s> No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
<s> I've got to go.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh no.
<s> I will.
<s> Why?
<s> That's quite a statement.
<s> It's Benjamin.
<s> Not now.
<s> I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
<s> No.
<s> Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
<s> You can't.
<s> Who?
<s> Have you seen it?
<s> Oh -- work!!
<s> No -- why? -- should I?
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
<s> All right. We'll dance.
<s> Chasing what?
<s> Would you like to make a man happy?
<s> I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
<s> And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
<s> You mustn't talk Russian to me.
<s> I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
<s> No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
<s> Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
<s> I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
<s> Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
<s> Oh -- 
<s> For Vienna?
<s> Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
<s> Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
<s> Don't.
<s> Bless you --
<s> No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
<s> Ready, Baron.
<s> Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
<s> Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
<s> The war dropped him here and forgot him.
<s> Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
<s> Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
<s> Don't do that. 
<s> No, Doctor.
<s> Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
<s> For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
<s> Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
<s> No.
<s> I didn't like Preysing right off.
<s> Oh yes, of course.
<s> Moreover...
<s> Me.
<s> Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
<s> That's from skiing.
<s> Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
<s> That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
<s> Well?
<s> I understand perfectly.
<s> Shhh -- here he is now.
<s> All you have to do is phone for it.
<s> Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
<s> You've decided against the merger?
<s> Then, it's all over?
<s> Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
<s> We did not approach you.
<s> I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
<s> You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
<s> Why waste time -- it's getting late.
<s> Ah, come on -- we're going home.
<s> I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
<s> I'm cancelling the engagement.
<s> Why not?
<s> You haven't time.
<s> I wish to be alone.
<s> What -- what is it? Last night...
<s> There was -- there was.
<s> Good morning, Gru -- your --
<s> Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
<s> But when did he go? How do you know?
<s> Again?
<s> Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
<s> Me?
<s> I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
<s> Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
<s> I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
<s> Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
<s> That.
<s> Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
<s> I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
<s> Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
<s> On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
<s> Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
<s> Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
<s> Can't move.
<s> Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
<s> What? He's going to be all right!
<s> Well, make it stop!
<s> Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
<s> Why? What's wrong?
<s> I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
<s> Hello.
<s> I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
<s> Perk.
<s> That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
<s> You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
<s> Get off the grift, Roy.
<s> We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
<s> Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
<s> She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
<s> Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
<s> You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
<s> I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
<s> Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
<s> I don't?
<s> Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
<s> I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
<s> My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
<s> I want to know everything about you.
<s> That's just Lilly's way.
<s> Oh, don't be stupid.
<s> It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
<s> I thought these people were broke.
<s> And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
<s> Upstate where?
<s> Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
<s> I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
<s> Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
<s> Open your door.
<s> I went out to Delmar.
<s> I saw her.
<s> But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
<s> No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
<s> Gun?
<s> It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
<s> One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
<s> Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
<s> Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
<s> We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
<s> Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
<s> Girl scouts.
<s> What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
<s> It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
<s> Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
<s> It's Amy Kramer.
<s> My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
<s> I think someone broke into my house.
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> No.
<s> My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
<s> I was trying to get away from someone.
<s> Yes.
<s> Call me Laurie, will ya?
<s> It's always John.
<s> It's not going to happen.
<s> Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
<s> I did alright.
<s> Shit, Linda!
<s> Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
<s> Guess so ...
<s> The voice man!  He's here!
<s> The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
<s> But I've seen him!
<s> No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
<s> Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
<s> Jamie?  But I thought she was --
<s> No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
<s> I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
<s> Him.
<s> Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
<s> To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
<s> He's gone.
<s> You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
<s> I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
<s> I'll meet you over there.
<s> Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
<s> Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
<s> I dunno, boy.
<s> How all the magazines show tits today.
<s> You know what gets me?
<s> Oh, shit.
<s> Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
<s> So long, Colonel.
<s> I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
<s> Go home!
<s> She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
<s> Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
<s> I dunno.
<s> Maybe it's time you got out.
<s> You're an imbecile.
<s> The posies are for her?
<s> What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
<s> Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
<s> We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
<s> Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
<s> Out!  Out!
<s> As a matter of fact--I am home.
<s> She has a master's degree in English literature.
<s> He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
<s> And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
<s> No, no, no, no, no.
<s> Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
<s> She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
<s> That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No.
<s> I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
<s> Daughter--I love you very much.
<s> My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
<s> The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
<s> Situation.
<s> I have a brain.
<s> "Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
<s> Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
<s> Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
<s> It's a big and busy funeral home.
<s> I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
<s> Just one favor.
<s> Rifle?
<s> He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
<s> He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
<s> If he thinks he's man enough.
<s> I plan to live one hundred years!
<s> Don't!
<s> Stop!
<s> Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
<s> Ooops.
<s> You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
<s> Hello, Mother.
<s> Oh dear.
<s> We'll miss you so.
<s> And her fianc!
<s> What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
<s> Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
<s> What a brilliant diagnosis!
<s> Are you've seen it work cures?
<s> It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
<s> Now who's being cruel?
<s> Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
<s> Comical?
<s> You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
<s> Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
<s> You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
<s> I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
<s> I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
<s> I'm utterly satisfied.
<s> No!
<s> Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
<s> You don't know?
<s> Premature ejaculation.
<s> I was afraid to ask.
<s> To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
<s> Don't know.
<s> That man is your father.
<s> Oh?
<s> Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
<s> He isn't any friend of Father.
<s> I know.
<s> He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
<s> How long has this been going on?
<s> Marry me instead.
<s> Take plenty of cigars.
<s> What?
<s> It's suicide!
<s> It's a jungle out there.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
<s> He died of a massive rupture.
<s> Yes, we do.
<s> Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
<s> What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
<s> Pull out your cock.
<s> Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
<s> ...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
<s> Wait?
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
<s> What girls you got here?
<s> I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
<s> Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
<s> Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
<s> What's that shade of blue called?
<s> Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
<s> You know her?
<s> I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
<s> What rate?
<s> Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
<s> You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
<s> But it's all you do.
<s> What do you care about?
<s> Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
<s> If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
<s> Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
<s> Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
<s> So then, Mr. Mast...
<s> Where is she?
<s> Hmm.
<s> Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
<s> Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
<s> Like what?
<s> Just leave me alone.
<s> Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
<s> Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
<s> Rucker.
<s> I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
<s> That's all right.
<s> Film making can be pretty expensive...
<s> Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
<s> ...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
<s> Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
<s> Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
<s> I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
<s> Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
<s> 'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
<s> Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
<s> Out!
<s> You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
<s> Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
<s> Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
<s> Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
<s> I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
<s> Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
<s> Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
<s> No, thank you. I have my car.
<s> Your hearse?
<s> Oh.
<s> It's very interesting.
<s> Oh, at the dentist's?
<s> Oh. Eh, I like it.
<s> Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
<s> I don't know. Just one of those. 
<s> Well...
<s> That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
<s> But what?
<s> But we can't just dig it up!
<s> It is kind of rough.
<s> Look, the ice is melting.
<s> Well, I really don't drink...
<s> No more revolts.
<s> Superb.
<s> The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
<s> How ingenious! Tell me about them.
<s> Of course.
<s> I like you, Maude.
<s> Well, why don't you?
<s> Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
<s> Really. Just put it there, Harold.
<s> Well, they're my species.
<s> Here.
<s> It's true. I can't live without you.
<s> Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
<s> Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
<s> Does that worry you?
<s> Why?
<s> Huh?
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
<s> To pit your own life against another.
<s> Another man's life in your sights.
<s> Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
<s> Souvenirs?
<s> Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
<s> Harold!
<s> Oh yes. That's fine.
<s> Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
<s> Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
<s> No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
<s> Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
<s> She certainly has.
<s> Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
<s> Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
<s> You were ALL human!
<s> You mean, outside... with her.
<s> Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
<s> "Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
<s> I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
<s> No. It's not.
<s> Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
<s> How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
<s> That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
<s> Oh, as opposed to -- ?
<s> Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
<s> As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
<s> "In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
<s> 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
<s> Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
<s> We're on the move.
<s> This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
<s> Anung-un-Rama...
<s> I can live with that.
<s> You never, ever light a cigar that way.
<s> Father's back?  Still angry?
<s> Oh-n-no -- I --
<s> Yes?
<s> Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
<s> Not from you.
<s> On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
<s> No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
<s> No. Myers is taking me.
<s> I like that...
<s> Doesn't sounds like him.
<s> I know.
<s> Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
<s> Look, do you want the bed in or not?
<s> Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Julia's my second wife.
<s> Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
<s> You can keep them.
<s> Oh Christ.
<s> Kirsty?
<s> No.
<s> What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
<s> Poor baby.
<s> Who are you?
<s> Tell me who you are.
<s> Who?
<s> What?
<s> Let me see.
<s> Yes. They'll never find us.
<s> Hi. I got soaked.
<s> Which is where?
<s> Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
<s> Where's Daddy?
<s> I have to see my father.
<s> We're going to freeze to death.
<s> The best part of ten years.
<s> He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
<s> I hear you.
<s> Why not?
<s> I'll be scarred for life.
<s> Larry....
<s> O.K.
<s> What's wrong with you?
<s> I don't know where to begin...
<s> Just soda.
<s> Please.
<s> There's a first time for everything.
<s> Am I?
<s> I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
<s> I found a room.
<s> Well come over, will you? See the place?
<s> You like?
<s> Surprise.
<s> I want to see.
<s> That's right. Cointreau.
<s> It's late.
<s> Are you alright ?
<s> Your father told me you were working here.
<s> What things?
<s> Will you GO, damn you?
<s> 'Bye.
<s> Really.
<s> I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
<s> That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
<s> Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
<s> Well what's the point in that?
<s> Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
<s> We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
<s> He offended me with his terrible taste.
<s> I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
<s> To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
<s> Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
<s> Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
<s> But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
<s> Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
<s> How do you know about that?
<s> Suck my ass.
<s> How many tickets can I put you down for?
<s> So?  You even said they're good.
<s> No.  We need the gig.
<s> We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
<s> No, you can't.
<s> Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
<s> I have all of the others.
<s> It's the new --
<s> On Clark Street!
<s> Why?
<s> Nobody.
<s> Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
<s> Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
<s> Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
<s> That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
<s> What's his name?
<s> There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
<s> Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
<s> Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
<s> Fine.
<s> Liz, hold on a second --  What?
<s> Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
<s> I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
<s> Think about it, Rob.
<s> I should be so lucky.
<s> Hi.
<s> I thought I could give you a lift back.
<s> Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
<s> It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
<s> Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
<s> Good.  So.  Is it my job?
<s> I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
<s> Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
<s> So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
<s> Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
<s> Just ask it!
<s> Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
<s> You don't ever think about other people?
<s> That bad, eh?
<s> Mmm hmm.
<s> Those aren't mine.
<s> I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
<s> Uh... No.
<s> C'mon.
<s> Want to know what, exactly?
<s> I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yup.
<s> Yes.  You?
<s> Oh, right.  Alright.
<s> And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
<s> Right.
<s> Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
<s> Well call her mother.
<s> Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
<s> Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
<s> I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
<s> That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
<s> Sure.  Ten cents.
<s> Naw.  Those are for us.
<s> I'm Vince.
<s> Nice.
<s> Maybe he's hiding from something.
<s> It's in good condition.
<s> There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Carl Smith.
<s> You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
<s> -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
<s> Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
<s> Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
<s> Are you?
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> Follow me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> You kill with your left hand?
<s> Come here, Brenna.
<s> I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
<s> Yes.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Four?
<s> You're an asshole, Moran.
<s> It's that important?
<s> I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
<s> Why are you here?
<s> Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
<s> What?
<s> And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
<s> That is not me.
<s> I'll be back when I can.
<s> That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
<s> I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
<s> Like you.
<s> I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
<s> Finish yours?
<s> Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
<s> Figure she's with him?
<s> Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
<s> We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Should I care?
<s> Yes.
<s> It doesn't.
<s> What are you getting at?
<s> The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
<s> We were very close.
<s> No.
<s> I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
<s> Sort of a Jack London style?
<s> It doesn't have to rhyme!
<s> Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
<s> That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
<s> And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
<s> On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
<s> Yes, wasn't it?
<s> But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
<s> I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
<s> I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
<s> Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
<s> How?
<s> And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
<s> Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
<s> So long.
<s> Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
<s> She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
<s> The money? Why?
<s> Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
<s> Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
<s> You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
<s> You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
<s> Your luck's not with you now!
<s> All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
<s> Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
<s> You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
<s> Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
<s> Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
<s> Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
<s> Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
<s> Just what I said. That's what I --
<s> Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
<s> Get away, Svengali.
<s> Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
<s> Bermuda... Rich, eh?
<s> Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
<s> Say, could I meet him?
<s> Now you got me.
<s> Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
<s> I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
<s> You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
<s> I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
<s> Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
<s> It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
<s> Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
<s> Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
<s> I know. Where is he, I said.
<s> You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
<s> All right, Walter.
<s> Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
<s> Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
<s> Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
<s> Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
<s> Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
<s> Don't tell me you were worried!
<s> Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
<s> What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
<s> Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
<s> Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
<s> No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
<s> What's that -- what's that?
<s> Take that mush out of your mouth!
<s> What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
<s> Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
<s> Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
<s> I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
<s> Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
<s> Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
<s> It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
<s> Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
<s> Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
<s> Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
<s> The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
<s> I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
<s> Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
<s> I'll have it in a minute.
<s> So long, Hildy.
<s> You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
<s> Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
<s> No, I couldn't do that.
<s> Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
<s> We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
<s> And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
<s> An attempt to ruin us!
<s> Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
<s> I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
<s> Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
<s> Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
<s> I was just going to!
<s> Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
<s> Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
<s> What's the matter? Getting yellow?
<s> Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
<s> What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
<s> Huh?
<s> That's good.
<s> From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
<s> You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
<s> What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
<s> Keep away!
<s> Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
<s> They're not human!
<s> Wait a minute, Mollie.
<s> Never mind! Just play dead.
<s> Shut up, you!
<s> The reprieve for Earl Williams.
<s> Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
<s> No, I don't think so.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You're insane!
<s> Look out where you're aiming, will you?
<s> Say, Hildy...
<s> I give that marriage six months.
<s> I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
<s> Very well, Grandpa.
<s> I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
<s> You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
<s> Looking for shrapnel.
<s> They're not.
<s> Bugger off.
<s> Bugger off, you bloody sod.
<s> Won't they have maps?
<s> It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
<s> Ask her yourself.
<s> Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
<s> ...and four and five...
<s> I'm starting my own collection.
<s> Well, for the baby, really.
<s> The sodding water table.
<s> It's like telling fibs.
<s> Please yourself.
<s> ...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
<s> Kiss me Hardy.
<s> I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
<s> Propaganda. We've been had.
<s> And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
<s> I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
<s> Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
<s> No, I won't.
<s> There, there, my baby.
<s> It's not. It's happening to me.
<s> No, Mother! It's War! War!
<s> It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
<s> Grace!
<s> Play something, Grace.
<s> Look after yourself, Grace.
<s> You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
<s> You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
<s> Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
<s> Really, that's a long time.
<s> Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
<s> Huh... what cone?
<s> Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
<s> Oh yeah, the tree.
<s> Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
<s> Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
<s> OK.
<s> Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
<s> You sure do a lot of guessing.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Are you two gals all funny with each other?
<s> I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
<s> Yeah, I'll do something.
<s> Now, what makes you think that?
<s> Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
<s> I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
<s> Great story Goober, how much?
<s> Holy crap, thanks!
<s> A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
<s> Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
<s> OK, Boss.
<s> How awesome?
<s> Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
<s> Well, technically I did what ya said.
<s> He won't move.
<s> Yeah, showtime for what?
<s> Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
<s> There's not enough room.
<s> What?
<s> What!
<s> Quiet.
<s> I gotta open the gate.
<s> And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
<s> Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
<s> Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
<s> Tickets for what?
<s> Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
<s> Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
<s> Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
<s> Shhhhhh.
<s> Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
<s> What? I didn't hear anything.
<s> Shhhhhh, quiet.
<s> Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
<s> Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<s> Huh?
<s> I don't doubt that.
<s> Firefly.
<s> I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
<s> Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
<s> What! God damn, how many?
<s> Who's your Daddy!
<s> Well, go get her.
<s> George Willis...  ...any leads?
<s> I ain't got a warrant.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
<s> Right.
<s> Aw, fuck.
<s> Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
<s> No "buts." Go to your room now.
<s> Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
<s> Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
<s> I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
<s> Of course not.
<s> I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
<s> Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
<s> It's true. I wouldn't lie.
<s> Stop. Get away.
<s> No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
<s> I just want to talk.
<s> Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
<s> Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
<s> That's Lila?
<s> Where do we look for little lost Puff?
<s> Okay, my sweet. Good night.
<s> Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
<s> Won't he be able to tell?
<s> And I think I'm going to.
<s> Lila, it's Rosie.
<s> Nathan told my brother.
<s> Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
<s> No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
<s> You've got to respect that.
<s> I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
<s> How's it going?
<s> Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
<s> No biggie.
<s> It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
<s> Nathan!
<s> Of course.
<s> Fifteen.
<s> That's very funny.
<s> A deer?
<s> If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
<s> Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
<s> Your entire body?
<s> Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
<s> I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
<s> Good. Making progress.
<s> Sure. Of course.
<s> My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
<s> How come?
<s> Such as what womanly things?
<s> Thank you very much for that.
<s> Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
<s> Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
<s> Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
<s> Ooka.
<s> Yahoo!
<s> It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
<s> Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
<s> I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
<s> Yes?
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
<s> You know what's good for him?
<s> For whom and for what?
<s> Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
<s> It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
<s> Good, good.
<s> I lost twenty bucks.
<s> I got drunk.
<s> How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
<s> Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
<s> Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
<s> Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
<s> Where do I sign?
<s> You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
<s> How good is he?
<s> Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
<s> No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
<s> Come on, let's go...
<s> Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
<s> How're the hands?
<s> Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
<s> Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
<s> I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
<s> You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
<s> Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
<s> Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
<s> Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
<s> My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
<s> Glad to meet you.
<s> You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
<s> I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
<s> Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
<s> Okay, friend.
<s> You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
<s> Yeah, I'm quittin'.
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> How come you didn't catch your bus?
<s> Then why go to the bus station?
<s> I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
<s> When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
<s> I'm getting treatments right here.
<s> When you've got money, you'll pay.
<s> Eggs. How do you like them?
<s> Haven't you opened it?
<s> Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
<s> I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
<s> What's it so hot in here for?
<s> A loser?
<s> Come here. Come on, now.
<s> Leave now.
<s> Why should I?
<s> If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
<s> I'll be up later.
<s> Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
<s> Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
<s> California. Oakland.
<s> Game's over, Eddie.
<s> That's good, Eddie. For how much?
<s> I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
<s> Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
<s> Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
<s> You're not them.
<s> We don't know that --
<s> Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
<s> Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
<s> That's fine.
<s> You got that right.
<s> This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
<s> If we want it, it is.
<s> Because the sky is so clear out here.
<s> That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
<s> What, Jim, what?
<s> I was so scared.
<s> I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
<s> I left it at work.
<s> Why, yes.  Why?
<s> I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
<s> About what?
<s> No.
<s> She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
<s> I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> But it's not, Jimmy.
<s> I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
<s> There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
<s> Mom -- this is the best show all year.
<s> What?
<s> Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
<s> Oh?
<s> It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
<s> I take it you've heard.
<s> He's a good man.
<s> We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
<s> All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
<s> That's the good news?
<s> They don't know this.
<s> Dad...
<s> Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
<s> I'm making a mess.
<s> What'd I say?
<s> Oh shit, we're late.
<s> Great.
<s> You as well.
<s> Doesn't matter. Game's over.
<s> She should be shortly.
<s> Better than we thought.
<s> But what, General?
<s> Roger.
<s> That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
<s> This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
<s> He's doing a good job.
<s> Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
<s> They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
<s> You know how I like to make a big entrance.
<s> Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
<s> How to kiss ass.
<s> Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
<s> For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
<s> We should leave too.
<s> But, Mr. President...
<s> Above American soil?
<s> Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
<s> These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
<s> Air... water... your "sun."
<s> Peace? No peace.
<s> You've got it!
<s> All your life.
<s> It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
<s> It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
<s> It's war.
<s> Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
<s> I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
<s> You said go between them!
<s> Don't know. Think of something.
<s> Where is it? I want it.
<s> All I have to do is scream.
<s> I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
<s> Don't call me that, please.
<s> Don't worry -- I'm fine.
<s> Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
<s> No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
<s> There were rats, Dad.
<s> You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
<s> What?
<s> Head for the fireplace!
<s> What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
<s> Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
<s> I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
<s> Hmmm... What did we talk about?
<s> And do I detect a rebuke?
<s> I know, Dad!
<s> The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
<s> We named the dog Indiana.
<s> Ready.
<s> After you, Junior.
<s> I'll take the camels.
<s> But, Indy --
<s> Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
<s> No.
<s> Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
<s> This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
<s> Miss Scott panicked?
<s> It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
<s> You should have been there...
<s> No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
<s> Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
<s> Lao She.
<s> Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
<s> "Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
<s> Behind you!
<s> Read you loud and clear, Indy!
<s> What?
<s> Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
<s> Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
<s> I don't understand. What's happened here?
<s> Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
<s> They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
<s> I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
<s> Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
<s> No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
<s> He told me they knew I was coming here.
<s> That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
<s> It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
<s> Their children?
<s> What?!
<s> Just one arm!
<s> What does the writing say?
<s> No -- real food.
<s> You're talking to an authority in that area.
<s> I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
<s> You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
<s> What -- the bug?
<s> You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
<s> I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
<s> I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
<s> Willie!
<s> Quiet!
<s> You've got to go to sleep now.
<s> Go!
<s> Not quite.
<s> Me.
<s> Al.
<s> Yes?
<s> What is your name?
<s> Where are we?
<s> Where are we now?
<s> No.
<s> Kill myself.
<s> Who was that? Somebody out there?
<s> Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
<s> If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
<s> No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
<s> Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
<s> I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
<s> I am. You are.
<s> Find You?
<s> Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
<s> I'll sue.
<s> We have to get out of here.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
<s> Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
<s> Send a man there. A secret agent.
<s> What about it?
<s> Who cares?
<s> We'll change your appearance.
<s> Just get there.
<s> What? What do you mean?
<s> She's beautiful...! What do I do?
<s> What's happening?
<s> Try another language.
<s> Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
<s> Where are you staying?
<s> I made it work.
<s> This...is not going to work out.
<s> Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
<s> Just hold them close and stay still.
<s> I don't know!
<s> That's good. It's not better. Where?
<s> Drink lots of water.
<s> I can't see a thing.
<s> While he makes the run.
<s> And Dieter?
<s> What exactly?
<s> About what?
<s> Rene?
<s> Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
<s> Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
<s> In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
<s> Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
<s> Then how did you know?
<s> We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
<s> It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
<s> We met on the beach.
<s> It's just money.
<s> He's not an ordinary man.
<s> You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
<s> And how do you service foreigners.
<s> I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
<s> What about it?
<s> Remember what?
<s> Oh....Sure.
<s> What?
<s> No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
<s> I said...I didn't say..anything!
<s> I didn't say anything.
<s> Do what?
<s> Me still. They left you alone?
<s> You did.
<s> And you, what do you like?
<s> They left. I had to go with them.
<s> There's not much to tell.
<s> Last night?
<s> No.
<s> This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
<s> What is it?
<s> Get your things.
<s> He plays it all the time.
<s> Why?
<s> They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
<s> Why did you, then?
<s> But you did it. It was you.
<s> Why'd you invite me here?
<s> What about the others.
<s> Why?
<s> Why not?
<s> Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
<s> Okay.
<s> You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
<s> How long?
<s> Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
<s> What do you mean, what's it do?
<s> Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
<s> Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
<s> Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
<s> No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
<s> C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
<s> No, I'm not...
<s> Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
<s> You alright, Mr. Wigand?
<s> What about you, you got a crew already?
<s> How grave?
<s> Call me back in ten.
<s> I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
<s> Did you say Berman?
<s> It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
<s> They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
<s> ...you fucked me!
<s> No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
<s> You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
<s> What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
<s> Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
<s> Hardly new news.
<s> What's this?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What?
<s> Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
<s> You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
<s> Oh, lots.
<s> You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
<s> Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
<s> That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
<s> Jump in, quick, c'mon...
<s> To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
<s> And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
<s> Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
<s> You believe that?
<s> They do this with impunity!
<s> ...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
<s> ...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
<s> I heard.
<s> Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
<s> I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
<s> What?
<s> She's okay.
<s> Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
<s> Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
<s> A delivery device for nicotine.
<s> And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
<s> That's why we hire scientists...
<s> Here. Got pictures.
<s> ...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
<s> You did good, Massey!
<s> She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
<s> Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
<s> Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
<s> I had no idea until after, but --
<s> You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
<s> Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
<s> A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
<s> Who do you want me to kill?
<s> Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
<s> So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
<s> I should be in therapy.
<s> Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.

<s> Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
<s> Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
<s> Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
<s> Marylin! Listen to me.
<s> So I hear. Is that all?
<s> Miles. Miles. Miles.
<s> Have you tried the duck?
<s> I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
<s> I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
<s> I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
<s> No. Don't stop.
<s> Me. Yes.
<s> Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
<s> She didn't love you?
<s> Boy. Boy, oh boy.
<s> Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
<s> Do you want to sleep on it?
<s> Oh Miles!
<s> I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
<s> Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
<s> Hello Miles.
<s> Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
<s> Marylin?
<s> We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
<s> Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
<s> By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
<s> Oh, God!
<s> So where are you now?
<s> Shit.
<s> No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
<s> What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
<s> Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
<s> Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
<s> Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
<s> ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
<s> That's her job. You have to respect that.
<s> Mm.
<s> Well -- is that possible?
<s> Sorry.
<s> We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
<s> Who's "Patty."
<s> Who's Rex's guy?
<s> What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
<s> It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
<s> Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
<s> Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.

<s> Oh, no.
<s> I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
<s> He doesn't think so much of you either.
<s> He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
<s> I suppose so.
<s> Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
<s> You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
<s> I haven't the slightest idea.
<s> Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
<s> Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
<s> Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
<s> I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
<s> I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
<s> Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
<s> If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
<s> Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
<s> I kind of half expected you to thank me.
<s> Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
<s> Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
<s> You're not really serious about this, are you?
<s> Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
<s> No. No. It's too good a story.
<s> Um. You're doing all right.
<s> Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
<s> There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
<s> You weren't so bad yourself.
<s> How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
<s> Not as long as I'm alive.
<s> What do you meanstarvation?
<s> Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
<s> Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
<s> You're prejudiced.
<s> What?
<s> Not if you're more hungry than scared.
<s> Well, take them off.
<s> Try me.
<s> Hitch-hiking.
<s> No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
<s> Oh, no!
<s> You figured that all out yourself, huh?
<s> Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
<s> Mind your own business.
<s> Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
<s> Why not? I'm hungry.
<s> Darling!
<s> Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
<s> Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
<s> Me?
<s> I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter
<s> Why, you bully. I believe you would.
<s> Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
<s> Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
<s> Ain't gonna wait a minute.
<s> What's that?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
<s> That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
<s> That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
<s> Wait a minute, GordonI
<s> Don't "Joe" me.
<s> Well, I got it, Joe.
<s> For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
<s> Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
<s> Zeke.  Git!
<s> Why?
<s> You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
<s> Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
<s> Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
<s> Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
<s> You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
<s> Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
<s> Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
<s> Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
<s> Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
<s> Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
<s> Yeah, I guess you do.
<s> No, I'm not...
<s> Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
<s> It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
<s> To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
<s> Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
<s> That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
<s> There's a word - orders.
<s> Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
<s> No, I did not.
<s> No, I did not.
<s> What did they...
<s> What was so appealing about Houston?
<s> Why Galveston?
<s> And then Sunday?
<s> I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
<s> I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
<s> Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
<s> But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
<s> Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
<s> Hi, Freckle Face.
<s> That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
<s> No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
<s> Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
<s> Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
<s> A Perry Russo?
<s> I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
<s> It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
<s> Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
<s> Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
<s> I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
<s> Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
<s> Between six and seven seconds.
<s> Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
<s> Who?
<s> Allen Dulles?
<s> We need him back.
<s> You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
<s> Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
<s> That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
<s> Yes.
<s> Ever ask him?
<s> I don't know if I should talk about this.
<s> If you buy what you read in the paper.
<s> I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
<s> The assassination, Jack?
<s> Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
<s> It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
<s> Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
<s> I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
<s> He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
<s> The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Oh, that's not a problem.
<s> Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
<s> We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
<s> Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
<s> Hey, Jackie.
<s> She wants to make a deal.
<s> That's my diet shit.
<s> 'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
<s> Okay.
<s> We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
<s> You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
<s> Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
<s> How many trips did you make?
<s> Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
<s> I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
<s> You went out this morning and bought a gun?
<s> Sure.
<s> I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
<s> What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
<s> No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
<s> It's not really something I think about.
<s> Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
<s> Surprise.
<s> Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
<s> Sandra Bullock. You know her?
<s> She's adorable. But I had to end it.
<s> I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
<s> Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
<s> No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
<s> Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
<s> And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
<s> He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
<s> You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
<s> Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
<s> Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
<s> Why?
<s> What's he doing?
<s> I know.
<s> You'll get over that.
<s> Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
<s> Not every day?
<s> You know what's in the bag you're taking?
<s> Can I smoke?
<s> I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
<s> His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
<s> We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
<s> Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
<s> Who's the other one?
<s> Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
<s> I was told ten thousand in each pack.
<s> What? To put one of these in my pocket?
<s> You'd take a polygraph on it?
<s> Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
<s> That coke was yours, wasn't it?
<s> Dreaming.
<s> Hi, Melanie.
<s> I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
<s> Go sit over in that chair.
<s> One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
<s> I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
<s> I do okay.
<s> They already know it's you.
<s> I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
<s> A woman.
<s> And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
<s> I'll give ya ten.
<s> I can do that.
<s> What'd you care?
<s> I need to talk to you alone.
<s> What the hell you talkin' bout?
<s> How do you know she did that?
<s> Where you gonna be during all this?
<s> If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
<s> We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
<s> No.
<s> We had done time together already.
<s> That sounds like a problem.
<s> You live with him.
<s> And your point is?
<s> All right already.
<s> Okay, Lou-is.
<s> That's good money.
<s> Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
<s> Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
<s> Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
<s> It's in there.
<s> If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
<s> I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
<s> You gonna tell me who it was?
<s> How am I supposed to know that?
<s> He's a big one. You two tight?
<s> They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
<s> Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
<s> Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
<s> I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
<s> She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
<s> And you did that to protect my interest?
<s> My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
<s> That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
<s> By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
<s> I call your office, she better answer the phone.
<s> I know where to turn.
<s> It's Beaumont.
<s> No problem.
<s> What isn't happening?
<s> There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
<s> How do you know?
<s> He was upset. He thought people were following him.
<s> Maybe the demons are real.
<s> Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
<s> It was the window.
<s> You need ... a doctor.
<s> I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
<s> We should get ourselves a lawyer.
<s> I thought you said she didn't say much.
<s> You should go back to her.
<s> Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
<s> Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
<s> Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
<s> Whataya mean, no record?
<s> It's freezing.
<s> If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Your kid dropped it off.
<s> Well, personally, I never went for church names.
<s> Lemme see.
<s> Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Where's Della? Bring her here?
<s> Show me Della!
<s> That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
<s> You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
<s> What?
<s> With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
<s> You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
<s> Why didn't you call me?
<s> It might be for me.
<s> It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
<s> No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
<s> Sit down, Jake.
<s> Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<s> You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
<s> I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
<s> Sit down!
<s> Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
<s> If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
<s> Never?
<s> What is it?
<s> Just relax.
<s> Well that's good to know.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> I no from around here.
<s> Hot. Where do I sign?
<s> Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
<s> If you're lucky.
<s> For what? For seeking the truth?
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
<s> I'm awake?
<s> That's a lie. My family was here.
<s> Of course it is. What else could it be?
<s> I need to see you, Jake.
<s> No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
<s> You can't talk in Brownsville?
<s> That black car?
<s> What's goin' on Paul?
<s> God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
<s> Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
<s> I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
<s> Died?
<s> Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
<s> Speaking of which, duck!
<s> Yes it does.
<s> Alright, asshole.
<s> Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
<s> He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
<s> What do you mean, not enough time?
<s> What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
<s> He....He...
<s> Cool.
<s> Where'd you get the gun?
<s> What are you gonna do, tell me?
<s> What are you doing back?!!
<s> Two more charges to go.
<s> Bring 'em all. Let's move!
<s> You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
<s> I don't know!
<s> Suit up.
<s> I am an expert!
<s> My job.
<s> Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
<s> You got that right.
<s> wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
<s> Where is he?
<s> Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
<s> Fuckin A...
<s> Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
<s> Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
<s> We have to get off this ship.
<s> Med-kit?
<s> That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
<s> So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
<s> You?
<s> I think so, why?
<s> Old woman?
<s> What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
<s> She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
<s> I'm on my way.
<s> The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
<s> GO, GO, GO!
<s> Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
<s> Just get us to the ship!
<s> You're leaving me here alone?
<s> Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
<s> I'm just saying.
<s> I'm afraid I cannot assist.
<s> Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
<s> I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
<s> No! He's coming with us!
<s> But?!!
<s> But...I...400 years?
<s> You wanna die?
<s> 4You're not going anywhere.
<s> Hockey player? He's not a ...
<s> Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
<s> I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
<s> Sure, Dad.
<s> Here --  Take him home.
<s> You got it.
<s> I know who he is...
<s> Who's driving the boat?
<s> Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
<s> Where...?
<s> No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
<s> Have you ever had one do this?
<s> He's taken him!
<s> In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
<s> Like you're from N'Yawk. 
<s> Where is he?
<s> Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
<s> You going to be all right?
<s> I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
<s> All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
<s> That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
<s> Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
<s> No, it was local jurisdiction.
<s> Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
<s> Florida license plate.
<s> No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
<s> Chum?
<s> Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
<s> It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
<s> You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
<s> A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
<s> That means closing the beaches.
<s> No...  You think we can get back with those?
<s> No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
<s> Do I set the goddam hook?
<s> Is that a boat?
<s> This is Quint, Missus.
<s> Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
<s> Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
<s> What do you see?
<s> 25 feet. And three tons of him there.
<s> Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
<s> No way! He can't!
<s> Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
<s> I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
<s> I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
<s> What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
<s> Um, hi?
<s> No...
<s> Huh?
<s> Also, I think I'm in love with you.
<s> The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
<s> Yup.
<s> No... I guess not.
<s> Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
<s> Hon, did you get expelled?
<s> Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
<s> First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
<s> Oh, go fly a kite.
<s> It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
<s> Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
<s> Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
<s> Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
<s> Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
<s> You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
<s> Blood and guts.
<s> Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
<s> Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
<s> Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
<s> You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
<s> Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
<s> Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
<s> Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
<s> I actually know this one.
<s> No?
<s> I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
<s> No thanks. I'm off pills.
<s> Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
<s> Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
<s> Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
<s> Elbow.
<s> I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
<s> No thank you. I'm off sex.
<s> Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
<s> You're pregnant?
<s> Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
<s> No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
<s> I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
<s> Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
<s> No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
<s> Think you can narrow it down for me.
<s> Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
<s> Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
<s> It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
<s> Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
<s> I am a suicide risk.
<s> It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
<s> It was magnificent, man!
<s> I'm staying pregnant, Le.
<s> Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
<s> There are ads? For parents?
<s> No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
<s> Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
<s> I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
<s> There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
<s> I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
<s> Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
<s> Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
<s> I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
<s> Hm.
<s> Carrie.
<s> ...I said, I like your hair.
<s> ...Yeah, sure.
<s> It's a portfolio of my work.
<s> ...That's not true.
<s> That's not true!
<s> Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
<s> Not so good. You sure you have to?
<s> Who?
<s> Ain't you goin' to record it?
<s> If you say so.
<s> ...Ha.
<s> Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
<s> It was definitely the high point of the evening.
<s> ...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
<s> Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
<s> Lighten up...
<s> You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
<s> Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
<s> Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
<s> What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
<s> ...You're hurting me...
<s> You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
<s> Wasn't my fault...
<s> Where would we find him?
<s> Without his car?
<s> Umm. Altogether?
<s> Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
<s> You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
<s> To what? Virgins?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What do you want?
<s> What for? That guys a dick.
<s> I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
<s> Right.
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
<s> Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
<s> Yeah me too nigga.
<s> He looks like my uncle.
<s> Who?
<s> She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
<s> Why I do what?
<s> I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
<s> Good luck?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah probably.
<s> Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
<s> Right here.
<s> Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
<s> Na.
<s> Hold on.
<s> I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
<s> Come on.
<s> But I'm scared Telly.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
<s> Why is that?
<s> But I only had sex with Telly.
<s> Everything is wrong.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
<s> I know.
<s> I didn't bleed.
<s> Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
<s> That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
<s> Because he can like climax you up to that...
<s> Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
<s> Yeah.
<s> He still does.
<s> What?!
<s> It's me. Telly.
<s> Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
<s> It's very monotonous.
<s> He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
<s> Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
<s> Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
<s> You are!  I don't like you.
<s> You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
<s> His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
<s> What?
<s> You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> How'd you get in here?
<s> What do you want?
<s> I was at the beach.
<s> I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
<s> Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
<s> She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
<s> I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
<s> Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
<s> You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
<s> We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
<s> That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
<s> You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
<s> Where is she?
<s> Then call them!
<s> Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
<s> So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
<s> You like to brag, don't you?
<s> I've figured out the message.
<s> No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
<s> You don't understand.
<s> They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
<s> Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
<s> Never mind.  He died two years ago.
<s> You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
<s> The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
<s> You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
<s> Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
<s> You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
<s> I just can't believe it.
<s> Not really.  It's pretty boring.
<s> Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No prints.
<s> There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
<s> Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
<s> I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
<s> It's important.
<s> But we heard him.
<s> Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
<s> What did he mean by Huxley?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Ten days ago.
<s> I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
<s> "Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
<s> Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
<s> "Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
<s> How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
<s> That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
<s> I went out.
<s> He knows you're aware of that.
<s> I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
<s> I want to be the best I can.
<s> Just thought you might want to talk.
<s> Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
<s> No.  I don't.
<s> Yes.
<s> I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
<s> You sound like my mother.
<s> How can you look at it so clinically?
<s> Let's change the subject.
<s> Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
<s> No.  You were talking about chess.
<s> Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
<s> Then show me who you are.
<s> --admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
<s> Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
<s> I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
<s> No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
<s> I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
<s> It's not that easy.
<s> Because she killed herself!!
<s> Why not?
<s> Are you going to come tonight?
<s> You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
<s> Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
<s> Well, you're beautiful.
<s> If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
<s> Never mind my ears! Go away!
<s> Thank you, but I can wait.
<s> No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
<s> In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
<s> I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
<s> I won't leave you here.
<s> Does the Queen live?
<s> Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
<s> What do you see?
<s> Where the spiral begins.
<s> Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
<s> No! You cannot know that!
<s> Yes.
<s> A forest near the Valley of Needles.
<s> You and I will guard the fire.
<s> Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
<s> Hah! You don't know me, boy.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Not sleepy, either?
<s> We must try to get horses.
<s> Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
<s> Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
<s> Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
<s> No.
<s> I'd wish for a puppy.
<s> First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
<s> Would you desert your friends?
<s> Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
<s> I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
<s> Hush!
<s> The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
<s> No. He will master the leader.
<s> You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
<s> Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
<s> A match for your son, I think.
<s> How many did you lose?
<s> Fewer will survive them.
<s> Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
<s> No, she was not as beautiful.
<s> Where is he? My son.
<s> Of what?
<s> No.
<s> Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
<s> OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
<s> Yeah... How do you know it?
<s> No?
<s> No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
<s> Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
<s> Well, I don't need them...
<s> What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
<s> Perfect.
<s> You were scared, weren't you?
<s> How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
<s> ...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
<s> I never rent my gear.
<s> That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
<s> Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
<s> A little...
<s> I love you so much, Leon.
<s> Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
<s> ...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
<s> ...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
<s> It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
<s> Mathilda, listen!
<s> Huh? That's smart!
<s> ...And how much is it?
<s> Messina.
<s> Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
<s> No... Dino's.
<s> ...Even his mother wouldn't.
<s> Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
<s> High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
<s> Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
<s> Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
<s> Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
<s> You need a ride, Preacher?
<s> Pardon?
<s> You do?
<s> Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
<s> Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
<s> You've just decided, is that right?
<s> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
<s> Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
<s> I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
<s> His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
<s> If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
<s> This guy's not a murderer.
<s> Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
<s> P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
<s> Maybe.
<s> You're amazing.
<s> Pulitzer, here I come.
<s> Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
<s> Walking where?
<s> Why know?
<s> What Mr. Parker?
<s> Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
<s> Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
<s> Hello.
<s> Evening News?
<s> It's yours.
<s> Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
<s> Water.
<s> Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
<s> To death?
<s> Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
<s> No, I can't have dinner with you.
<s> You do?
<s> Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
<s> Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
<s> Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
<s> That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
<s> I know that...
<s> Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
<s> Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
<s> Oh, and what did you do?
<s> Be careful.
<s> Yes... I'll give you that.
<s> They wouldn't know.
<s> You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
<s> Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
<s> And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
<s> Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
<s> I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
<s> Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
<s> Where have you been staying?
<s> It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
<s> What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
<s> Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
<s> He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
<s> He's an ass that's gonna try.
<s> That's not what's important.
<s> I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
<s> Who could better understand than me?
<s> Did she have a weapon in her hand?
<s> I guess.
<s> She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
<s> I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
<s> Thank you.
<s> What?
<s> For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
<s> See?
<s> Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
<s> Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
<s> You know her?
<s> Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
<s> I know. He has it sent out.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, you are.
<s> You think?
<s> But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
<s> Your scrunchie?
<s> What?!
<s> The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
<s> My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
<s> How do you figure?
<s> No, she can't move for an hour.
<s> Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
<s> Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
<s> Absolutely!
<s> I got bangs!
<s> I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
<s> Why not?
<s> She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
<s> Your what?
<s> But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
<s> I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
<s> How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
<s> A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
<s> Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
<s> I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
<s> Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
<s> Cunnilingus?
<s> Yeah, luckily.
<s> Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
<s> I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
<s> Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
<s> You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
<s> Grotesque... monstrous...
<s> You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
<s> Not from me, surely...
<s> We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
<s> I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
<s> I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
<s> I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
<s> Do it now!
<s> I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> Oh, yes...
<s> It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
<s> I didn't know... I --
<s> It's terrible.
<s> Oh no... Don't you understand?
<s> No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
<s> Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
<s> We be honored, friend Ogg.
<s> And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
<s> You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
<s> I fear she's lost.
<s> What does she want from me?
<s> Big question that, lad.  Why what?
<s> How is it this hag knows the truth?
<s> Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
<s> Have we turned grave-robber, then?
<s> And who might that be?
<s> Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
<s> You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
<s> What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
<s> A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
<s> Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
<s> Something the matter?
<s> We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
<s> We'll find it.
<s> Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
<s> Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
<s> On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
<s> And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> Can you save her?
<s> Mean you to seek him out below?
<s> I've not heard a note out of you.
<s> Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
<s> No, no, no... this is different!
<s> Gonna make ogre-stew!
<s> Three cheers for our champion.
<s> Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
<s> Blackheart.  Aptly named.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> They rival the angels of paradise.
<s> My father and the Baron.
<s> I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
<s> Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
<s> A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
<s> If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
<s> Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
<s> Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
<s> Jack... Forgive me...
<s> And I... love you...
<s> I can't have been under much more than a minute.
<s> Everywhere!  Ow!
<s> Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
<s> Thought the weather terrible of late.
<s> The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
<s> Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
<s> Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
<s> Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
<s> She's dead!
<s> Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
<s> Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
<s> Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
<s> You... you... you mortal you!
<s> Heading north still?
<s> We wait.
<s> I think she's about to foal.
<s> Small miracles better than no miracles...
<s> Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
<s> May God protect you.
<s> You follow.
<s> I wanna be with you today.
<s> I guess it depends on what you give up on.
<s> I love red!  That's my favorite color!
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Uh...using Josh like that.
<s> Nope.
<s> I don't want you to!
<s> Why are you so stupid?
<s> You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
<s> What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
<s> Okay.  I guess.
<s> Floating to Catalina.
<s> He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
<s> He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
<s> And if I enclosed it?
<s> A sink?
<s> Months.
<s> Maybe that's too long.
<s> I hate this job.
<s> For everything.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> We're getting out of the ground today.
<s> Why would you be there?
<s> No I'm not!
<s> If you hit me, I'll call the police.
<s> I almost saw Catalina.
<s> No you don't.
<s> I don't know.
<s> A friend of yours is here.
<s> The gloves on the table are for you.
<s> You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
<s> Don't.  I don't want it.
<s> I know.  Why?
<s> What do you know about me?
<s> I'm telling you now.
<s> To hide a black eye.
<s> I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
<s> I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
<s> The kind where there isn't really an answer.
<s> You know what mortise and tenon is?
<s> I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
<s> I need you to do me a favor.
<s> She needs to be alone, I think.
<s> She's a little sad, is all.
<s> He doesn't answer.
<s> Why does he have a lock on his door?
<s> I want him with me.
<s> I'm married.
<s> Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
<s> Sam's favorite.
<s> I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
<s> What did I say?
<s> I can't pick you up.
<s> You bit my finger.
<s> No.  Mostly me.
<s> It's not my back that's killing me.
<s> What are you doing home?
<s> Sam took them to a movie.
<s> Do you like red?
<s> Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
<s> Nagger?
<s> Better make it a week.
<s> Cost you a pair of nylons.
<s> Hell with him. It ain't that.
<s> Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
<s> Is Spanky here?
<s> Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
<s> Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
<s> But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
<s> Take care of me?
<s> You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
<s> You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
<s> You went to Monroe?
<s> Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
<s> You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
<s> You need collateral.
<s> What'd you say?
<s> That jelly you were talking to right here?
<s> That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
<s> Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
<s> Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
<s> Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
<s> Claude.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
<s> New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
<s> Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
<s> He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
<s> Say what?
<s> Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
<s> We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
<s> They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
<s> Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
<s> The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
<s> Go where, Ray?
<s> No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
<s> They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
<s> Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
<s> Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
<s> You killed Santa Claus?
<s> No problem. Oh, boy!
<s> My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
<s> He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
<s> Hey, Ray...
<s> Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
<s> Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
<s> I prefer bourbon.
<s> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
<s> Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
<s> Something like that, yes.
<s> That's a long story...
<s> You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
<s> I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
<s> Understood.
<s> He's sick?
<s> You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
<s> Don't do it!
<s> Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
<s> Urr... uggg... errr...
<s> Show him Central Park.
<s> Maybe try the opposite of that.
<s> Angels don't get any older, son.
<s> It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
<s> I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
<s> I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
<s> Put it in your mouth.
<s> It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
<s> Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
<s> Release the evil?
<s> I think you're looking at him.
<s> Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
<s> Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
<s> Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
<s> What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
<s> Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
<s> That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
<s> I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
<s> I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
<s> By she, do you mean he?
<s> Oh, would you grow up.
<s> 'Bout time...
<s> Should we wake him up?
<s> The Dark Prince is here.
<s> You followed him?
<s> All right...
<s> Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
<s> I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
<s> My dad's an optometrist.
<s> It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
<s> Why would you be floating?
<s> Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
<s> Okay, I do. Get back up here.
<s> Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
<s> You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
<s> From? From? From?
<s> Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
<s> Just wondered... what happens?
<s> I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
<s> Please... No.
<s> No.  Just no.
<s> I thought I had to do something.
<s> Curious.
<s> I suppose. But what if you want to live?
<s> Six. I go red next year.
<s> Both... running's what I'm interested in.
<s> A Runner gave it to me.
<s> But what is this -- why?
<s> We'll convince them.
<s> How will they know we're coming?
<s> It's the only way.
<s> You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
<s> Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
<s> You know, Jessica.
<s> "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
<s> No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
<s> He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
<s> To what?
<s> I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
<s> Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
<s> It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
<s> But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
<s> No.
<s> A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
<s> No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
<s> What makes you think so?
<s> Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
<s> I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
<s> Not yet.
<s> More... many more.
<s> Stay? They lived together all their years?
<s> Yes...
<s> No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
<s> Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
<s> Texaco... What's wrong with that?
<s> What?
<s> This is our bedroom.
<s> Maid? Relative?
<s> Or not so recently?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know what I think?
<s> It's me...
<s> Me, too.
<s> So what do we do?
<s> No, honey... It was part of the deal.
<s> He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
<s> We killed him.
<s> Alice?
<s> We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
<s> Alice?
<s> No.
<s> All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
<s> I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
<s> What's the word on the street?
<s> I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
<s> I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
<s> Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
<s> He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
<s> A headache?
<s> SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
<s> No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
<s> The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
<s> I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
<s> What do you mean? You're where right now?
<s> I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
<s> I wish I knew.
<s> But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
<s> But...
<s> What job?
<s> Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
<s> No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
<s> Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
<s> It'll be ready.
<s> Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
<s> You know who it is.
<s> You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure.
<s> Sorry... I...
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't want to talk about it...
<s> I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
<s> YOU'RE SORRY!!
<s> FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
<s> Yes. Might as well - all of it.
<s> I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
<s> It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
<s> I'm a paleontologist.
<s> A paleontologist.
<s> Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
<s> Good morning
<s> Why, of course. Yes.
<s> I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
<s> That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
<s> All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
<s> Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
<s> As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
<s> Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
<s> colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
<s> Horns? What kind of horns?
<s> So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
<s> I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
<s> Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
<s> No.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
<s> How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
<s> You have no disputes over women?
<s> That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
<s> Centuries.
<s> Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
<s> Shall we have another?
<s> Yes, charming.
<s> Suppose she should leave it?
<s> Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
<s> Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why, no.
<s> I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
<s> Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
<s> Yes.
<s> No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
<s> Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
<s> I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
<s> Yes.
<s> Come on! Quick! This way.
<s> Yes.
<s> Dead?
<s> Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
<s> I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
<s> Let me go, Bob!
<s> I don't see that there's anything to say.
<s> So you think I'm mad?
<s> I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
<s> Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
<s> You're wrong, George.
<s> I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
<s> What was that?
<s> As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
<s> Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
<s> Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
<s> You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
<s> Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
<s> Bump?
<s> Struggling, why?
<s> Why?
<s> Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
<s> English!
<s> Yes.  Barney!
<s> Please don't go.
<s> I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
<s> All right, I'll be there.
<s> Hesitated, sir.
<s> Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
<s> It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
<s> I guess I lost:
<s> Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
<s> And if I say yes?
<s> I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
<s> All the time, sir.
<s> Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
<s> Sir, you can't just--
<s> Right.
<s> So what's the problem?
<s> She didn't even know you. .
<s> Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
<s> History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
<s> Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
<s> I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
<s> And what's this ... ?
<s> Where to?
<s> That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
<s> I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
<s> Kay.  All I'm saying--
<s> That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
<s> Since as long as we've been keeping records...
<s> Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
<s> Do have any idea what I just said?
<s> Actually, you may have.
<s> No.
<s> You figured what?
<s> You're not taking me in!
<s> It's... coming.
<s> Will it lower the curve?
<s> Scientific American?  Really?
<s> Don't tell me.  Insects.
<s> Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
<s> Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
<s> Is it now?
<s> Agatha...
<s> Wait.
<s> Agatha, you're never going back there.
<s> Then who was he?
<s> Found?  Where?
<s> How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
<s> Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
<s> How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
<s> -- go blind.  I know.
<s> No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
<s> Try again.
<s> So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
<s> Hang on, Lamar --
<s> I understand.  What's the other thing?
<s> He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> We won't let them.
<s> Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
<s> And who the hell is that?
<s> Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
<s> I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
<s> Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
<s> All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
<s> Run the subscription list...

<s> We're in motion on something.
<s> Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
<s> There's no question.  You don't have any.
<s> Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
<s> I need help with her.
<s> I guess that's all of it.
<s> Uh, I'll try...
<s> What a big boy.  How old are you?
<s> I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
<s> I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
<s> No.  He got tired of pretending.
<s> The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
<s> I'm your son.  I'm you.
<s> No.
<s> The precogs were wrong.
<s> Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
<s> I'm... not... a... killer.
<s> You say some of the children died?
<s> Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
<s> Hold that thought.
<s> It's always in the more gifted of the three.
<s> He's dead, Lara.
<s> Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
<s> You look great.
<s> Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
<s> I'll be right there.
<s> What?
<s> Where are you?
<s> I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
<s> Shhh.  You know what I hear?
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> I know who you are.
<s> Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
<s> You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
<s> So you haven't seen his apartment?
<s> I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
<s> Shhh!  They're sleeping.
<s> Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
<s> When served warm --
<s> Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
<s> Yeah. Take it.
<s> Somebody's getting comfortable.
<s> He's alright.
<s> She's, uh, sleeping.
<s> Chloe?
<s> Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
<s> Mommy's not home?
<s> What time is it there?
<s> Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
<s> Where were you?
<s> A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
<s> I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
<s> The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
<s> You shouldn't. He likes you.
<s> Shhh. He'll hear you.
<s> Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
<s> Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
<s> I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
<s> Ruiz tied in out there?
<s> He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
<s> Why?
<s> She was fast, huh?
<s> That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
<s> So, that's it. I'm out?
<s> I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
<s> I know.
<s> Yeah. Sorry.
<s> He'll work it off.
<s> I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
<s> Hi. I'm Jimmy.
<s> Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
<s> Don't be shitty.
<s> Then why do you try to get in?
<s> No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
<s> You wanna go right now?
<s> Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
<s> See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
<s> I'm not taking her to a bar.
<s> This paint sucks. The white shows through.
<s> Is that the woman from..?
<s> To keep?
<s> What's the movie?
<s> Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
<s> Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
<s> Well, I don't want to walk.
<s> They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
<s> They asked who it was.
<s> Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
<s> Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
<s> What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
<s> Like I said, I don't know.
<s> You would think.
<s> Fuck this.
<s> Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
<s> I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
<s> Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
<s> Let's just go now and wait.
<s> Easy...
<s> Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
<s> I'll be a minute.
<s> Bobby and Ricky.
<s> The line's over there.
<s> How is it you're good? You on a list?
<s> What?
<s> S'up.
<s> Ugh...
<s> Where do you live?
<s> Where do you live?
<s> Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
<s> He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
<s> What? Why am I bad?
<s> Watch it...
<s> Here...
<s> That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
<s> Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
<s> You think it's funny, motherfucker?
<s> The Soho Grand?
<s> You're from LA, right?
<s> You'll love it.
<s> No. What is it?
<s> Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
<s> And where do we bring it?
<s> Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
<s> What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
<s> Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
<s> She poured it for --
<s> Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
<s> He had it coming.
<s> When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I done told the man what he could do with his train.
<s> You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
<s> Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
<s> No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
<s> You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
<s> Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
<s> You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
<s> When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
<s> You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
<s> Tell you this: you ain't no fool.

<s> What?
<s> How do you like it?
<s> We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
<s> Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
<s> The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
<s> I don't think that's such a good idea.
<s> I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
<s> Is my family here yet?
<s> Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.

<s> Tell him about Baldy.
<s> I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
<s> How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
<s> That's right.
<s> Watch your tongue, boy.
<s> This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
<s> Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
<s> I guess that makes you the smart one.
<s> He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
<s> How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
<s> [Four-seven-four-seven.]
<s> [Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
<s> [It's non-negotiable.]
<s> [That's what everybody keeps saying.]
<s> Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
<s> Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
<s> Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
<s> Everything happens once if you live long enough.
<s> You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
<s> Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
<s> I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
<s> I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
<s> If they like me.
<s> Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
<s> Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
<s> No.
<s> Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
<s> White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
<s> But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
<s> It must be difficult having lots of wives.
<s> I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
<s> There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
<s> Still not a question.
<s> Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
<s> You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
<s> Planned what?
<s> And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
<s> Do you know what she told me last night?
<s> For a year?
<s> We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
<s> You do?
<s> Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
<s> Don't forget your towel.
<s> These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
<s> She's young. She'll get over it.
<s> [Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
<s> [You only give information so you can fuck me.]
<s> I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
<s> So am I.
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
<s> I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
<s> We just talked.
<s> Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
<s> I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
<s> I feel fine.
<s> Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
<s> It's her baby too, you know.
<s> I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
<s> Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
<s> Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
<s> Who?
<s> Were the lights on?
<s> I'm having a very good time, too.
<s> I'm thirty-four.
<s> It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
<s> I really should get home...
<s> No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
<s> I'd like that very much.
<s> How do you do?
<s> We just live one flight up.
<s> Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
<s> Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
<s> Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
<s> About eight o'clock.
<s> Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
<s> No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
<s> Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
<s> I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
<s> Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
<s> Tomatoes.
<s> Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
<s> Marty...
<s> Put on your blue suit...
<s> Marty...
<s> I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
<s> I don't know. I don't think so.
<s> She didn't look Italian to me.
<s> You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
<s> Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
<s> Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
<s> Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
<s> Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
<s> We gotta ask Marty, of course.
<s> The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
<s> Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
<s> Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
<s> Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
<s> I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
<s> We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
<s> How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
<s> Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
<s> I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
<s> I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
<s> He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
<s> Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
<s> How you, Radar?
<s> Hospital.
<s> Back home.
<s> No.  Or why you should.
<s> He said it for us all, Walt.
<s> There's only one way.
<s> Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
<s> That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
<s> No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
<s> Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
<s> The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
<s> Same general idea.
<s> Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
<s> C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
<s> Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
<s> I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
<s> He can't take much more time on the table.
<s> We been had.
<s> We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
<s> Except we forgot one other small thing.
<s> This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
<s> You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
<s> A football game?
<s> N-n-no thanks, G-General.
<s> You willing to b-back that up with odds?
<s> Right.
<s> Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
<s> All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
<s> C-A-M-E-M...?
<s> So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
<s> Radar!
<s> On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
<s> He can move in here with us.
<s> Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
<s> That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
<s> Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
<s> Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
<s> We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
<s> There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
<s> For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
<s> Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
<s> I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
<s> I didn't have much choice.
<s> Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
<s> The one and only.
<s> Just in dreams?
<s> You can cut the bow.
<s> I don't think so either.
<s> If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
<s> Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
<s> There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
<s> You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
<s> I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
<s> I can try, sir.
<s> What's that, Henry?
<s> Good morning.
<s> I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
<s> No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
<s> It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
<s> Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
<s> Yeah, maybe.
<s> Oh, crabby guy, huh?
<s> You got me.
<s> You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
<s> Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
<s> Me?
<s> Yeah, that's the one.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Money.
<s> No, no, nothat's your seat.
<s> A third party?
<s> Mr. D. B. Norton!
<s> Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
<s> Do you mean the speech you're writing?
<s> There is no letter.
<s> Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
<s> The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
<s> Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
<s> That's all, Ned. Thank you.
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh!
<s> No, no, no. Now that's too much!
<s> Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
<s> Sure. Mostly often.
<s> There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
<s> Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
<s> Yeah? Well, you can have it!
<s> Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
<s> Yeah, you bet!
<s> You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
<s> Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
<s> Were you paid for itor weren't you?
<s> Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
<s> I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
<s> Good night, John.
<s> You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
<s> Nineteen!
<s> Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
<s> And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.
<s> I think it must have been a sea- gull.
<s> Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
<s> You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
<s> You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
<s> Good. I don't want to be late.
<s> Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
<s> Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
<s> I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
<s> Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
<s> Am I gettin' the car?
<s> You want a convertible or hardtop?
<s> ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
<s> Solis said to keep you clear of this.
<s> Roper, we're into it...
<s> I'll give you something.
<s> I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
<s> I know.
<s> Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
<s> Well, if I have to, I have to.
<s> Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
<s> I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
<s> So what do I say to this guy?
<s> What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
<s> Yes.
<s> Thou shall have no other God before me.
<s> Still needs work.
<s> To run late!
<s> Occasionally you lose.
<s> Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
<s> Only that floor.
<s> Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
<s> You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
<s> She's the one to blame. Not me.
<s> What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
<s> You worship yourself.
<s> You got a bet on the game tonight?
<s> Scottie...
<s> ...Let me just show you.
<s> I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
<s> It's all over, babe, it's all over.
<s> Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
<s> Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
<s> I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
<s> You let us worry about that.
<s> What happened to your Trans Am?
<s> He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
<s> I need to take back what's mine.
<s> True.
<s> Okay...
<s> About what?
<s> No...
<s> Not my problem.
<s> Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
<s> What about the customers with reservations?
<s> The weather.
<s> -- Yes.
<s> Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
<s> The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
<s> It's not used for anything.
<s> Good question.
<s> Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
<s> Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
<s> Katie was digitized.
<s> If she's alive, you get it back.
<s> Her?
<s> Yes.
<s> Not you.  A copy.
<s> Sorry?!
<s> Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
<s> Just like that?
<s> -- Waiter.
<s> Uplink selected.
<s> If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!

<s> Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
<s> Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
<s> There's enough for everybody!
<s> If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
<s> BULK!!
<s> Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
<s> How about Major Moron?
<s> Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
<s> Quack like a'duck!
<s> What do you mean "basically"?
<s> How'd you know?
<s> Activating Power Scope!
<s> When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
<s> And a lot more. Can we talk?
<s> But ya got a Boss.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Poor, yeah.
<s> Not another word.
<s> I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
<s> An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
<s> What's that divided four ways?
<s> From your mouth ta God's ear.
<s> You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
<s> When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
<s> But if ya can't catch the guys...
<s> You got men on Profaci's place?
<s> Long as Charlie says.
<s> Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
<s> I'm already late.
<s> I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
<s> As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
<s> Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
<s> Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
<s> It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
<s> Guess I'm not a single type guy.
<s> Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
<s> Might as well put the time to use.
<s> It's not myself I'm worried about.
<s> Who?
<s> Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
<s> Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
<s> Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
<s> You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
<s> I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
<s> You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
<s> You gotta plan these things.
<s> How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
<s> They're friends of our enemy.
<s> The kid just called me stupid.
<s> I must know more of you, my son.
<s> Don, I'd be honored.
<s> The name's Charlie.
<s> You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
<s> What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
<s> We were overdue to get hit.
<s> Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
<s> Come on. Be polite.
<s> Jesus.
<s> I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
<s> Guess I'm just lucky.
<s> One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
<s> Just wanted ta say hello.
<s> That a Jew compliment?
<s> Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
<s> Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
<s> Olive. - Where exactly am I?
<s> Sad commentary, huh?
<s> Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
<s> <u>Why</u>??
<s> I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
<s> Bend over?
<s> I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
<s> Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
<s> Thank me next time you see me.
<s> But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
<s> Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
<s> I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
<s> Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
<s> A piata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
<s> What'll it do if they pull the plug?
<s> Maybe you could talk to Death!
<s> Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
<s> Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
<s> You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
<s> You're acting kind of...odd.
<s> Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
<s> Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
<s> <u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
<s> It looks so...<u>new</u>.
<s> They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
<s> Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
<s> What's the "bad" part?
<s> I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
<s> Give me a date, Doctor.
<s> Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
<s> You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
<s> How am I gonna get past the guards?
<s> THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
<s> Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
<s> Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
<s> Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
<s> I don't <u>know</u>.
<s> Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
<s> I'm just concerned about my daughter.
<s> Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
<s> Behind the books.
<s> I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
<s> Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
<s> No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
<s> Oh, I hope so, dear.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
<s> What does he do?
<s> ... Manly?
<s> Are you sure you got my bag in?
<s> Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
<s> Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
<s> Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
<s> Never.
<s> I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
<s> Looks like it, but--
<s> I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
<s> You got worms.
<s> Whadaya mean--*right*?
<s> What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
<s> Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
<s> What?
<s> Okay--I mean--
<s> Susan? Nah!
<s> You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
<s> Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
<s> Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
<s> Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
<s> Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
<s> I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
<s> That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
<s> All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
<s> Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
<s> Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
<s> He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
<s> Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
<s> Henry Hill.
<s> This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
<s> Aw--
<s> Ma! Hold him!
<s> I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
<s> Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
<s> Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
<s> To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
<s> Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
<s> Here--where are you running off to?
<s> I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
<s> The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
<s> Jefferson--
<s> What?
<s> We'd better see.
<s> Like what, Mr. Taylor?
<s> What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
<s> Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
<s> Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
<s> Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
<s> Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
<s> Right.
<s> The Steering Committee.
<s> Yes, Senator--*twice*.
<s> But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
<s> Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
<s> Since sixteen or so.
<s> Go right ahead.
<s> Why?
<s> No!
<s> Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
<s> Not another bill?
<s> *Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
<s> I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
<s> Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
<s> Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
<s> The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
<s> I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
<s> Ring the call to quorum.
<s> How's that, buddy?
<s> Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
<s> Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
<s> Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
<s> Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
<s> Well, well!
<s> Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
<s> No?
<s> You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
<s> I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
<s> --in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
<s> Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
<s> Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
<s> Jim, you don't have to--
<s> Just a minute, Joe!
<s> *I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
<s> Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
<s> Senator Paine.
<s> Order!
<s> Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
<s> I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
<s> Morning, neighbors. Morning.
<s> Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
<s> Oh yes, pixilated.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Never can tell what he's going to do.
<s> Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
<s> Yes, indeedy.
<s> Yes.
<s> They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
<s> It isn't all! I'd like to explain
<s> Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
<s> Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
<s> Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
<s> Oh - uh - nothing.
<s> No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
<s> Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
<s> What are they going to do?
<s> It's wonderful.
<s> Huh?
<s> Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
<s> You can almost spit on it, can't you?
<s> Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
<s> Nothing
<s> Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
<s> Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
<s> I don't blame you.
<s> A girl?
<s> Oh, hello darling.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yeah, then what?
<s> We're not going out tonight.
<s> Hello.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
<s> I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
<s> Last night he proposed to me.
<s> Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
<s> I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
<s> Come on - let's go!
<s> John
<s> I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Me, sir?
<s> Let me go!
<s> Wants to know who the heir is.
<s> I'm not interested in the newspapers.
<s> No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
<s> Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
<s> You can't?
<s> What?
<s> How do you do.
<s> Buffer?
<s> Who - me? No.
<s> Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
<s> Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
<s> Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> "There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
<s> Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
<s> Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
<s> Oh, they insisted on following me.
<s> Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
<s> Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
<s> We own an opera house, don't we?
<s> But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
<s> I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
<s> Me?!
<s> Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
<s> Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
<s> Ja.
<s> Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?
<s> That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
<s> One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
<s> Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
<s> An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
<s> I write poetry.
<s> Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
<s> Now you keep out of this!
<s> Christian Svenson.
<s> What's that?
<s> Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
<s> But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
<s> Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
<s> Hmm?
<s> No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
<s> Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
<s> A friend?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Not any more.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
<s> I don't want to hear any more today.
<s> You are so mean.
<s> I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
<s> Doc. Nice to meet you.
<s> Nope.
<s> I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
<s> Yes.
<s> No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
<s> Oh?
<s> I'd better get in there.
<s> It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
<s> You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
<s> Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
<s> Doc.  Ainge...
<s> Why do you watch?
<s> That's it? That's what you're giving me?
<s> Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
<s> -- Go on!
<s> Is she a friend of yours?
<s> Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
<s> Mother... go away!
<s> There's something I think we need to talk about.
<s> We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
<s> Is she against you getting help?
<s> Something's bothering her.
<s> So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
<s> Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
<s> Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
<s> It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
<s> No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
<s> Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
<s> Yeah?
<s> That's... good?
<s> Of course.
<s> What was that?
<s> You're not the only one...
<s> But...
<s> I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
<s> I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
<s> I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
<s> What'd he say?
<s> Is that the question?
<s> You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
<s> Don't you like this?
<s> Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
<s> It's not?
<s> Just you.
<s> Everybody has a story, Skip.
<s> Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
<s> You were messed up, man.
<s> Things got a lot worse.
<s> That'd be Lily.
<s> All new people start with that...
<s> "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
<s> Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
<s> Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
<s> None of the above, thank you.
<s> You always did have more balls than brains.
<s> Even?
<s> Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
<s> Why do you like to fight so much?
<s> It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
<s> That's one way of putting it.
<s> Intestines.
<s> Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
<s> And burn the map and retrieve the key.
<s> For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
<s> What did you do to him!?
<s> Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
<s> To be hanged.
<s> Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
<s> Broad?!
<s> No.
<s> I know my treasure.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Preparation for what?
<s> Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
<s> No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
<s> That bad huh?
<s> Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
<s> Yes?
<s> Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
<s> I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
<s> Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
<s> Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
<s> Um, well, you see...
<s> I only gamble with my life, never my money.
<s> We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
<s> Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
<s> The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
<s> Except for one little thing.
<s> Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
<s> I'll be down in a jiffy.
<s> Atta, boy!
<s> Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
<s> But you're a superhero.
<s> Me, too.
<s> They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
<s> It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
<s> Doctor Heller?
<s> You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
<s> You're nuts.
<s> They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
<s> Just a waitress.
<s> Really?
<s> Sure -- I guess.
<s> Or you'll what? CAN ME?
<s> I guess... Are you always so angry?
<s> Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
<s> Me, too.
<s> Are you nuts? Get out of there!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What?
<s> And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
<s> He is in love. His anger is gone.
<s> LOOK!
<s> Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
<s> He's got the fact that he's Superman!
<s> I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
<s> Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
<s> Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
<s> No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
<s> Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
<s> Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
<s> Not yet.
<s> And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
<s> Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
<s> Mother... it's not what you think!
<s> I always knew that you were special.
<s> Or both.
<s> Sorry.
<s> I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
<s> The who?
<s> But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
<s> General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
<s> Proceed.
<s> You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
<s> Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
<s> I did, sir.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> Cavalry?
<s> Any cannon?
<s> They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
<s> But who made this treaty?
<s> What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
<s> I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
<s> No, sire... I was asleep.
<s> Come back in an hour.
<s> Yes, sir, I am.
<s> Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Ajaccio.
<s> I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
<s> You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
<s> His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
<s> Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
<s> What is that?
<s> Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
<s> I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
<s> You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
<s> Would you like some brandy?
<s> You must not act impetuously.
<s> My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
<s> I thought I was.  I was confused.
<s> No.
<s> One had better legs.
<s> What are you doing in there?
<s> Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
<s> Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
<s> There are some things... better left unsaid.
<s> My God, what do you think?
<s> God help me -- yes.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, of course.  What do you want?
<s> My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
<s> Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
<s> Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
<s> No.
<s> I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
<s> My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
<s> He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
<s> Eugene de Beauharnais.
<s> My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
<s> From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
<s> And I can go free?
<s> Alright, I'll remember that.
<s> Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
<s> Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
<s> Good.
<s> Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
<s> I'm his cousin.
<s> You know what he mean, dude.
<s> Not me.
<s> Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
<s> Black magic.
<s> What about the dog?
<s> Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
<s> Cheeco.
<s> I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
<s> I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
<s> Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
<s> Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
<s> I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
<s> What you mean, so?
<s> D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
<s> I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
<s> Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
<s> It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
<s> Wait for what?
<s> Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
<s> Better sooner than later.
<s> Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
<s> Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
<s> Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
<s> I do.
<s> It's alright.
<s> Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
<s> Nice to meet you?
<s> I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
<s> You damn right that's the big one.
<s> You could sell your Beamer.
<s> Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
<s> Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
<s> Where's Craig?
<s> Ya'll live around here?
<s> Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
<s> Bite his ear!
<s> Thanks for the help.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What urgent message?
<s> Huh?
<s> Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
<s> The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
<s> Okay.  Bye, Craig.
<s> The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
<s> Business.
<s> Sorry.
<s> One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
<s> That's...a comfort to hear.
<s> I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
<s> And your husband works for somebody else.
<s> It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
<s> Tell me why I miss him.
<s> You fucked up.
<s> I want'to talk to her.
<s> I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
<s> I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
<s> Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
<s> Over and out.
<s> What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
<s> I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
<s> Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
<s> What?
<s> The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> Thanks for the tip.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
<s> Why?
<s> Nah.  Hates his wife.
<s> Only you.
<s> No.
<s> Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
<s> When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
<s> When'll the skiff be ready?
<s> Don't!
<s> It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
<s> She went.
<s> Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> About what!
<s> Walt!
<s> Sshhh! He's in there.
<s> Come on!
<s> It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
<s> John don't like him much.
<s> I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
<s> You what?
<s> John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
<s> Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
<s> Hush, Pearl. Come on.
<s> About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
<s> A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
<s> You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
<s> You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
<s> I'll tell.
<s> Under the stone in the floor.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Yes?
<s> All right.
<s> Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
<s> Naturally.
<s> Because John said I mustn't.
<s> A strange woman is a narrow pit!
<s> It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
<s> She turned me out of the bed.
<s> He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
<s> I -- no, I --
<s> Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
<s> How'do.
<s> Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
<s> What's wrong, John?
<s> Didn't you hear me, boy?
<s> None of your business, Madam.
<s> I sure as hell hope so.
<s> It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
<s> Thank God.
<s> Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
<s> One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
<s> I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
<s> Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
<s> Just checking -- keep out of sight!
<s> Who?
<s> Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
<s> You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
<s> What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
<s> You don't know he did it.
<s> Nan, I --
<s> Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
<s> Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
<s> Right home after. See you.
<s> It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
<s> Right.
<s> Okay.
<s> Dead and gone.
<s> Go on...
<s> Just sleep now, Mom.
<s> We should get her out of here...
<s> I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
<s> Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
<s> Really. Turn 'er up a little.
<s> Jungle man fix Jane.
<s> Good evening, Ninotchka.
<s> An omelet.
<s> You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
<s> I don't want to go to Siberia.
<s> All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
<s> ...and little Lady Beatrice?
<s> Positively not!
<s> Or it might be the firing squad!
<s> If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
<s> For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
<s> Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
<s> Monsieur.
<s> You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
<s> I think I need my glasses.
<s> Don't worry... there will be enough.
<s> I must be stern with you.
<s> Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
<s> Good morning, Gaston.
<s> Count d'Algout...
<s> I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
<s> Oh, Leon, you are so good.
<s> How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
<s> While you eat, you look at the view.
<s> Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
<s> ...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
<s> My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
<s> I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
<s> What did she say about me?
<s> Brave... that's right.
<s> Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
<s> Monsieur.
<s> Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
<s> If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
<s> Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
<s> Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
<s> Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
<s> We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
<s> That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
<s> I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
<s> Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
<s> What business?
<s> No visa.
<s> Me?
<s> Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
<s> I'll try.
<s> That's a strange angle.
<s> I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
<s> Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
<s> Yes.
<s> It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
<s> Thank you. Thank you.
<s> Wounded? How?
<s> I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
<s> Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
<s> You know I want to...
<s> I don't like your following me.
<s> But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
<s> That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
<s> Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
<s> I don't think so.
<s> That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
<s> Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
<s> Anything, Ninotchka.
<s> Ninotchka, you're jealous.
<s> My darling.
<s> There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
<s> And General Savitzky.
<s> A funny story?
<s> Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
<s> What, darling?
<s> Comrades! Good people of France!
<s> No speech?
<s> I love you, my little Leonitchka!
<s> Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
<s> But I can throw it out of the window.
<s> If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
<s> We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
<s> A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
<s> No.
<s> How do you do?
<s> Yes.
<s> There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
<s> What is this, Swana?
<s> What?
<s> Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
<s> If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
<s> Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
<s> Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
<s> That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
<s> I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
<s> Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
<s> It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
<s> Raw carrots and beets.
<s> Where do you eat?
<s> Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
<s> Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
<s> Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
<s> John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
<s> I figured that out.
<s> Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
<s> Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
<s> Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
<s> No, sir.
<s> I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
<s> I thought the gloves were off.
<s> Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
<s> Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
<s> And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
<s> ... go on.
<s> You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
<s> That's what they're doing.
<s> Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
<s> How do you see this?
<s> There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
<s> That's right ...
<s> I know it well, sir.
<s> Sir?
<s> No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
<s> That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
<s> How is this national security?
<s> I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
<s> Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
<s> They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
<s> Money.  Follow the money.
<s> No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
<s> This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
<s> How?
<s> Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
<s> My friends call me "Mister President."
<s> Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
<s> I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
<s> Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
<s> Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
<s> Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
<s> But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
<s> You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
<s> It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
<s> It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
<s> I always get my man.
<s> No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
<s> It won't.  As long as I'm here.
<s> Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
<s> We'll see about that.
<s> Agreed.
<s> Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
<s> It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
<s> Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
<s> Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
<s> ... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
<s> I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
<s> Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
<s> How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
<s> You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
<s> Free, if you're the president.
<s> Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
<s> You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
<s> ... but it was all we had.
<s> Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
<s> Elvis I like, too.
<s> Yes, I understand that.
<s> And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
<s> Sir?
<s> POWs.  And their families.
<s> Well, we could delete it.
<s> I know ...
<s> Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
<s> I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
<s> No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
<s> You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
<s> Is that the truth?
<s> He doesn't want me at the funeral.
<s> Can I just ask for one thing?
<s> I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
<s> Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
<s> It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
<s> Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
<s> Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
<s> You're drunk!
<s> Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
<s> Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
<s> The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
<s> Yes, you've circled round.
<s> I don't know. I feel overmatched.
<s> You don't know what he thinks.
<s> Most don't.
<s> Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
<s> It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
<s> I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
<s> Some pretty bad people.
<s> The old boy shot by the highway?
<s> That's very linear Sheriff.
<s> You sure?
<s> Mm.
<s> There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
<s> Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
<s> Yes Sheriff.
<s> We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't know. Had dreams.
<s> Well they always is to the party concerned.
<s> Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
<s> What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
<s> At the gettin' place.
<s> No. I found it.
<s> You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
<s> That'll work.
<s> Why would we go to Odessa?
<s> Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
<s> Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
<s> Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> You know what's goin' on?
<s> What did you tell him?
<s> Why would I let you do that?
<s> It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
<s> I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
<s> I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
<s> Where does he work?
<s> Step out of the car please, sir.
<s> Why would I care where you're going.
<s> He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
<s> I seen you was from Dallas.
<s> I didn't mean nothin' by it.
<s> With what?
<s> You married into it.
<s> I don't know. I couldn't say.
<s> Call it?
<s> Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
<s> You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
<s> Okay. We can stop that.
<s> I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
<s> You want to change rooms?
<s> He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No sir.
<s> You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
<s> Oww! My arm, careful!
<s> Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
<s> So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
<s> That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
<s> I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
<s> Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
<s> Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
<s> No, I didn't have to.
<s> Oh. How come?
<s> This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
<s> ...I... I know what you are.
<s> Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
<s> Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> This is really awkward...
<s> I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
<s> I don't think I am.
<s> I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
<s> Are you and Larry happy?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
<s> She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
<s> Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
<s> Didn't I?
<s> I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
<s> David, please --
<s> Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
<s> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
<s> I ran back in to get the phone.
<s> She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
<s> What?
<s> It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
<s> Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
<s> Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
<s> Ahh, look, right now's not very...
<s> Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
<s> Los Angeles, California.
<s> Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
<s> Man, that is love.
<s> Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
<s> God, that's awful!
<s> David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
<s> Shhh! I heard you the first time.
<s> To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
<s> Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
<s> Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
<s> No, that should be more than --
<s> Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
<s> Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
<s> Of what?
<s> Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
<s> Beer, please.
<s> Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
<s> Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
<s> Hell of a way to die.
<s> IT SURE IS!!
<s> You told me how to do it!
<s> Well, why'd you shoot him?
<s> ...that's a good motto.
<s> Should I kill him now?
<s> ...among others.
<s> We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
<s> "It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
<s> Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
<s> If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
<s> He's waiting...
<s> "Injuns?"
<s> No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
<s> I'll think about it.
<s> Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
<s> What the hell's going on?
<s> Would you say she was ambitious?
<s> ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
<s> Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
<s> Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
<s> Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
<s> I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
<s> No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
<s> No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
<s> You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
<s> Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
<s> Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
<s> Good Lord, what do we do?
<s> Fire! I hate fire!
<s> Gopher, Everett?
<s> That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
<s> Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
<s> Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
<s> Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
<s> Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
<s> Assa good idea, Pappy.
<s> Campaign manager? Waldrip.
<s> Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
<s> Not out the other side his face, though.
<s> I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
<s> Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
<s> No weddin'.
<s> That's good, honey.
<s> Not your...
<s> That wasn't my doing...
<s> Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
<s> Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
<s> Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
<s> Million point two.
<s> Well that hardly sounds like you...
<s> Isn't it, uh...
<s> I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
<s> Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
<s> No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
<s> How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
<s> They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
<s> Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
<s> But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
<s> Blooey!
<s> He's a suitor!
<s> I been calling for four months.
<s> That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
<s> Nobody. It just came to me.
<s> You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
<s> Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
<s> Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
<s> Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
<s> The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
<s> Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
<s> Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
<s> I'm doing okay, sir.
<s> I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
<s> Well, goodbye.
<s> Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
<s> Pardon?
<s> No, sir!
<s> Zack, don't!
<s> Yes, sir!!
<s> Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
<s> Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
<s> Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
<s> That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
<s> What?
<s> Come on. Let's go dance.
<s> I got my foot on the floor.
<s> Yeah... Mmmm...
<s> Everything was different.
<s> No way... Would you?
<s> Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
<s> You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
<s> Be a friend. Leave.
<s> Any time, sailor.
<s> Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
<s> Hey, will you just leave me alone?
<s> When I'm good and ready.
<s> No. Is that what you want?
<s> So?
<s> Why'd he do it?
<s> Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
<s> Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
<s> Shhhh...
<s> That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
<s> But it can't wait.
<s> A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
<s> I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
<s> Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
<s> Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
<s> That's right.
<s> I have the gun.
<s> Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
<s> That's their problem.
<s> You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
<s> The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
<s> I know.
<s> Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
<s> Shut up and let me think.
<s> Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
<s> Hey.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> Can we come in?
<s> Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
<s> Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
<s> I said open the door.
<s> Don't!
<s> It's just the woman and the kid?
<s> How many more do we have after this?
<s> 0150.
<s> It doesn't work?!
<s> What do they want?
<s> They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
<s> Shaky?
<s> Say fuck.
<s> Little bit.  Yeah.
<s> What am I, a five year old?
<s> I am.  I'm here.
<s> "Titanic."
<s> Come on, come on...
<s> Yeah, but where's the third guy?
<s> He won't even know who it was.
<s> What if I keep dropping?
<s> You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
<s> I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
<s> You know that's bullshit.
<s> Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
<s> Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
<s> Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
<s> Naw... I gotta...
<s> N... N...... Not... Oh.
<s> I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
<s> Jesus...
<s> ...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
<s> From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
<s> Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
<s> Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
<s> Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
<s> Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
<s> Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
<s> They were empty...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
<s> But nothing... you do live here don't you?
<s> And who is we?
<s> Just a kid.
<s> Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
<s> Later for that. I'm done either way...
<s> I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
<s> Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
<s> Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
<s> Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
<s> Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
<s> I don't know. I really don't.
<s> It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I expect to try.
<s> You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
<s> Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
<s> Do you?
<s> Very well, then.
<s> Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
<s> That one is a bit more difficult.
<s> Prisoner exchange.
<s> You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
<s> I understand, sir.
<s> Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
<s> He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
<s> It's safer if we stay together.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You know how old I am.
<s> Flanking riders?
<s> Father?
<s> We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
<s> She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
<s> What?
<s> Granted.  Where are you going?
<s> And what do they know?
<s> That's right.
<s> Please.
<s> When?
<s> They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
<s> No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
<s> Goodbye, Harry.
<s> Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
<s> He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
<s> Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
<s> Yayyy!
<s> Well, I thought it was safe--
<s> To remember.
<s> I hate that smell.
<s> Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
<s> You believe in it.
<s> Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
<s> Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
<s> Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
<s> I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Does she love the cat?
<s> Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
<s> Whose burying ground?
<s> Why? For God's sake, why?
<s> Your cairn.
<s> Don't worry about that.
<s> The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
<s> Come on--let's parole 'em.
<s> Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
<s> According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
<s> I just said--
<s> Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
<s> I got eggs down here!
<s> That's forgotten.
<s> Elizabeth goes free!
<s> You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
<s> See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
<s> Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
<s> And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
<s> Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
<s> Can I trust you?
<s> I can't breathe.
<s> Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
<s> -- then we never would have met.
<s> -- but that was not a proper kiss.
<s> Me!
<s> It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
<s> Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
<s> Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
<s> More to drink!
<s> We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
<s> Yes, the rum is gone.
<s> Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
<s> I know.  That was for the smell.
<s> We're not going to just surrender!
<s> I don't think that will be necessary.
<s> Smith.
<s> I said, no lies.
<s> Indeed.
<s> I'll be at the wheel myself.
<s> I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
<s> My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
<s> Aye!  Avast!
<s> 'Bootstrap?'
<s> My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
<s> You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
<s> The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
<s> Depends.
<s> I'll lead them away.
<s> -- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
<s> The Black Pearl is a real ship.
<s> Yes it is.  I've seen it.
<s> ... No.
<s> And no lies!
<s> My apologies, Governor.
<s> Where did he come from?
<s> An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
<s> Bleak.  Very bleak.
<s> You got it, Dr. Argon.
<s> Speak.
<s> Have you found Dr. Bright?
<s> If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
<s> You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
<s> Maybe you should, but you can't.
<s> You mean besides kicking your ass?!
<s> That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
<s> Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
<s> She let it escape because she wants me to die.
<s> You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
<s> In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
<s> Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
<s> Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
<s> Why are there two ottomans?
<s> I'm so excited, Icarus.
<s> If you loved me like I loved you?
<s> The nanobot is gone.
<s> I want Trix!  Mommy!
<s> Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
<s> A man?
<s> Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
<s> This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
<s> You're looking for a urine sample.
<s> Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
<s> So, I guess it worked.
<s> And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
<s> Been out for six months now.
<s> All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
<s> Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
<s> It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
<s> Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
<s> What happens?
<s> No, why?
<s> No, no, I just feel wired!
<s> Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
<s> I don't know.
<s> I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
<s> You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
<s> Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
<s> We don't have time to argue, Susan.
<s> We were different people then.
<s> I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
<s> Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
<s> You were looking for us?
<s> Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
<s> Yes, that is what I was thinking.
<s> Yes - isn't it.
<s> Certainly. Right over there.
<s> Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
<s> Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
<s> Sure, I'll take a chance.
<s> How-di-do.
<s> My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
<s> It isn't cheap. It's nice.
<s> Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
<s> Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
<s> Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
<s> What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
<s> Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
<s> Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
<s> I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
<s> All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
<s> You're the Tribune man?
<s> Well, I should say!
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> Oh boy, I'd love it.
<s> A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
<s> Yeah - go on.
<s> You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well - it's only April.
<s> All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
<s> I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
<s> You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
<s> Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
<s> Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
<s> Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
<s> Oh no, sir!
<s> I beg your pardon, sir?
<s> There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
<s> I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
<s> Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
<s> Yes.
<s> Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
<s> There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
<s> On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
<s> Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
<s> Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
<s> Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
<s> Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I dyed one and washed the other.
<s> Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
<s> Yes - and I'd love it.
<s> Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
<s> Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
<s> Conrad.
<s> Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
<s> It'll be ready in a minute.
<s> There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
<s> Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
<s> No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
<s> Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
<s> You don't.
<s> Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
<s> I beg your pardon.
<s> And now for that twentieth crack
<s> Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
<s> About what? Your marriage to Anne!
<s> Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
<s> Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
<s> Now the lady said you may go
<s> No, sir.
<s> Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
<s> Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
<s> Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
<s> Yeah?
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
<s> Sure.
<s> Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
<s> I won't.
<s> I'm sorry ...
<s> Bud brought it to me.
<s> But I really should get home.
<s> All night?
<s> I don't want it to go away.
<s> I think ... I might be ill ...
<s> So.
<s> With what?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah ... How'd you know?
<s> No it couldn't!
<s> I'm fine--but thank you.
<s> One of those ... big beds?
<s> Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
<s> Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
<s> Well, I never had to do it before.
<s> Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
<s> I thought the books were blank?
<s> Green.
<s> Owns the hardware store.
<s> Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
<s> As a matter of fact he does.
<s> Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
<s> So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
<s> Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
<s> They don't have that kind of potential.
<s> Sure.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
<s> What?
<s> No. You baked them for Whitey.
<s> Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
<s> Oh ... Right.
<s> Hunh?
<s> Rain.
<s> Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
<s> It was a prop for the school play ...
<s> Sure ...
<s> I like it too.
<s> Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
<s> Yeah ... Sort of ...
<s> My name's David.
<s> I can't.
<s> Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
<s> I didn't do anything wrong.
<s> They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
<s> I'm going on trial tomorrow?
<s> Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
<s> ... Yeah.
<s> There aren't any cheeseburgers.
<s> Just a little--You know.
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
<s> And what was this?
<s> This is "Fly With Us?"
<s> I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
<s> That's it.
<s> She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
<s> It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
<s> ....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
<s> Hello everyone.
<s> Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
<s> I'm just laying on my bed.
<s> Do you like porno movies?
<s> Are your pants off?
<s> I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
<s> Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
<s> What do you mean it doesn't matter?
<s> Where is she?
<s> This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
<s> I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
<s> No. I'm sorry.
<s> ....what....?
<s> I need help.
<s> This is not cool.
<s> You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
<s> They don't get opened until eight.
<s> Not very well.
<s> You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
<s> It's fine. It was fun, though.
<s> Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
<s> Really?
<s> -- well, if you're gonna go --
<s> Sure.
<s> ....Hi.....
<s> Yeah, no, I see --
<s> Yes.
<s> Ok.
<s> Did something happen; are you alright?
<s> So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
<s> If you come to Hawaii --
<s> Ok.
<s> ...I don't know what you mean....
<s> You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
<s> I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
<s> I'm fine are you ok?
<s> I'm fine, I have your work number.
<s> You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
<s> I know.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Can you say that my name is Jack?
<s> I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
<s> I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
<s> CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
<s> YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
<s> I didn't know you had a sister?
<s> Well I'm sorry. Before...
<s> And I'm sorry that I did that.
<s> I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
<s> Like a psychiatrist?
<s> You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> ....yes.....
<s> Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
<s> Hi.
<s> How much money do you have in your pockets?
<s> You have an ATM?
<s> You have another house somewhere or something?
<s> What is this, man?
<s> Well....what do you want, then?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> You can't be late.
<s> Seriously.
<s> Uch. Shut up, Dean.
<s> Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
<s> Sorry.
<s> Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
<s> Ok.
<s> No.
<s> I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
<s> It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
<s> We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
<s> For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
<s> At your service, Count.
<s> Yes, Abbe?
<s> It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
<s> You'll hate me now, won't you?
<s> It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
<s> But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
<s> More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
<s> Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
<s> You among them?
<s> How can one man possibly be so selfish?
<s> That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
<s> Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
<s> That's enough.
<s> Valcour. His chair.
<s> Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
<s> Because your writing continues, unchecked.
<s> AND DID YOU?
<s> Why was it you never took her by force?
<s> Was it impotence?
<s> It's a formality; truly.
<s> He's sworn to obedience.
<s> Oh indeed?
<s> Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
<s> He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
<s> A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
<s> I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
<s> Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
<s> Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
<s> I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
<s> It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
<s> There's something else I want from you.
<s> Is it terribly erotic?
<s> The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
<s> Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
<s> It's only been described to me. In your books.
<s> Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
<s> First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
<s> Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
<s> "What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
<s> Oh, but I am!
<s> Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
<s> I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
<s> If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
<s> Forgive me, I beg you --
<s> They've put you up to this, haven't they?
<s> He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
<s> I wonder sometimes.
<s> Am I?
<s> Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
<s> I can't
<s> To make pictures.
<s> I'll remember that.
<s> Do you?
<s> Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
<s> I am not that woman.
<s> There's nothing to explain
<s> We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
<s> There is nothing to discuss-
<s> It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
<s> I wanted it
<s> You will not walk out on me
<s> Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
<s> Huh?
<s> Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
<s> He personally asked you to?
<s> Uh-huh
<s> Showing life
<s> Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
<s> Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
<s> Okay, boy wonder, what?
<s> I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
<s> Please don't say this.
<s> Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
<s> Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
<s> So speaks the court jester.
<s> How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
<s> Don't do this
<s> Don't do this
<s> And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
<s> Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
<s> This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
<s> I don't give a shit about-
<s> Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
<s> And they went to the stockholders in New York.
<s> I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
<s> Herman.
<s> Thank you-
<s> And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
<s> That's for me to decide.
<s> Again.
<s> Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
<s> Jesus
<s> They've all seen a rough cut
<s> I really think you're
<s> The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
<s> Yes!
<s> Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
<s> Hit me in the face.
<s> You heard me, I said hit me.
<s> Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
<s> Here's your glove.
<s> Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
<s> What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
<s> I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
<s> No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
<s> You want the title shot or not?
<s> This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
<s> Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
<s> When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
<s> When?
<s> Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
<s> Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
<s> Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
<s> So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
<s> What?
<s> Whadda ya mean?
<s> Whatsa matter with you?
<s> Stop it. What're you, crazy?
<s> Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
<s> That's all right. He don't mind.
<s> It's OK.
<s> Who asked you?
<s> What did I do?
<s> You're hurting my arm.
<s> What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
<s> You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
<s> What?
<s> I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
<s> I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
<s> Are you drunk?
<s> Don't make no difference no more.
<s> Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
<s> Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
<s> Right, the gym.
<s> Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
<s> Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
<s> I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
<s> But his leg!
<s> When the lock is broken -- yes.
<s> Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
<s> Well, officer -- do your duty.
<s> I think they missed their chance with her.
<s> What time?
<s> Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
<s> How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
<s> Mrs. Thorwald.
<s> He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
<s> That depends on who "they" were.
<s> You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
<s> If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
<s> You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
<s> Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
<s> Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
<s> Gunnison?
<s> I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
<s> I don't know what you mean.
<s> I only have a hundred dollars or so.
<s> It crashed, didn't it?
<s> She's all right.
<s> That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
<s> She pay you much?
<s> How did you know!
<s> I was.
<s> And some man will lose his.
<s> He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
<s> Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
<s> There's something buried there.
<s> What?
<s> Would four of them -- ?
<s> Smart girl.
<s> That'll get her out of there, won't it?
<s> How much do you think you'll need?
<s> Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
<s> When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
<s> Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
<s> Going on right here. It's a big night.
<s> You mean leave the magazine?
<s> Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
<s> Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
<s> She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
<s> I think it's enchanting.
<s> There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
<s> Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
<s> All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
<s> I have one now.
<s> I wouldn't dare answer that.
<s> I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
<s> To get on home.
<s> Someone not his wife?
<s> He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
<s> Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
<s> Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
<s> Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
<s> You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
<s> Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
<s> It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
<s> It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
<s> And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
<s> Phone number?
<s> I'm glad they let you out.
<s> What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
<s> Give me some dirt.
<s> Jim Stark.
<s> Down in back.
<s> I think I should go home.
<s> Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
<s> Hold it, Jim.
<s> You make any sandwiches?
<s> Yeah!
<s> You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
<s> I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
<s> She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
<s> Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
<s> No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
<s> You don't?
<s> Have some cigars.
<s> A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
<s> That's right!
<s> What's that pounding?
<s> Well maybe she better start.
<s> No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
<s> I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
<s> Look--can't you see I'm writing?
<s> My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
<s> What?
<s> I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
<s> Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
<s> O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
<s> Who's that!
<s> Shut up.  Are you nuts?
<s> Wow!  Well now-there-then!
<s> Not lately.
<s> When was that?
<s> I'm here.
<s> I've got a gun.
<s> I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
<s> Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
<s> My gun?
<s> But you didn't hurt anybody.
<s> All right, darling.
<s> It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
<s> I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
<s> It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
<s> Good Lord!
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> Just tell a little white lie?
<s> Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
<s> No.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Bully for you.
<s> You going there?
<s> Dig the square wardrobe!
<s> A what?
<s> I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
<s> Neither can I.
<s> I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
<s> If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
<s> No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
<s> See, we're very modern.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
<s> Yes.  My best friend.
<s> Okay.
<s> Talk to them!  Heavens!
<s> My mother?
<s> I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
<s> Gabriel, what are you doing!
<s> I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
<s> And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
<s> We're talking, aren't we?
<s> To all those cons...
<s> That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Radio said negative five.
<s> Tell me again.
<s> Ash, you've gotten me enough --
<s> You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
<s> What the fuck is going on.
<s> Nick, no --
<s> Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
<s> For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
<s> Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
<s> No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
<s> What?
<s> They're truck drivers.
<s> We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
<s> Nick...
<s> I'm almost done.
<s> Is there any way you could get into his truck?
<s> We still gonna spend Christmas together?
<s> I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
<s> I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
<s> Yes!
<s> Yes!
<s> Yes!
<s> I never worked at no casino.
<s> What?
<s> J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
<s> A station wagon in Canada.
<s> Her brother.
<s> Hey.
<s> Christmas... Eve...
<s> Get out.
<s> ...ttt..tt... two out of three?
<s> Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
<s> How'd you know my name was Rudy.
<s> Take 'em.
<s> Leave the tree.
<s> And where they hide the real money.
<s> Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
<s> What... Powwow...
<s> OPEN IT!!!
<s> What?
<s> Hi, Nick.
<s> I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
<s> He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
<s> Merlin, I didn't know --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
<s> Thought you hate your old man.
<s> Standing right here, man!
<s> Alamo...
<s> You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
<s> YOU TELL HER!
<s> ...for Christmas...
<s> She set them up. All of them.
<s> I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
<s> Thanks, don't mind if I do.
<s> First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
<s> Yes.
<s> Fine, now.
<s> No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
<s> No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
<s> You're coming back to work for us, right?
<s> What?
<s> Really? Who's your P.O.?
<s> Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
<s> Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
<s> What? Nobody set anybody up.
<s> Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
<s> And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
<s> It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
<s> ...What bar?
<s> I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
<s> Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
<s> I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
<s> No, they're not.
<s> That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
<s> That's your proof?
<s> Don't ask me that.
<s> Mr. Pink.
<s> Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
<s> You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
<s> It's a surprise.
<s> You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
<s> I can' take you to a hospital.
<s> Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
<s> Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
<s> Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
<s> Why not?
<s> That's not correct.
<s> The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
<s> Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
<s> A few cops.
<s> That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
<s> What do you think?
<s> You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
<s> Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
<s> That fuckin did it!
<s> This is what he was doin'.
<s> Yeah, those guys too.
<s> Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
<s> No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
<s> I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
<s> As far as -- Sonora?
<s> I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
<s> Yeah.
<s> His letters will keep.
<s> No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
<s> Go on. Tell me more about her.
<s> It's too light yet.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Hurry up.
<s> Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
<s> Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
<s> I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
<s> Like what?
<s> Yes.
<s> Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
<s> Good thing you didn't.
<s> I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
<s> Finished, son?
<s> That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
<s> I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
<s> What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
<s> I don't care what she asked you.
<s> Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
<s> Kind of sore.
<s> So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
<s> All right, you didn't know.
<s> I said I didn't care.
<s> Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
<s> Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
<s> Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
<s> No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
<s> Just a thing I was workin' on.
<s> Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
<s> Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
<s> I don't like to see you go.
<s> Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
<s> Maybe you are. I'm not.
<s> One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
<s> I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
<s> Good night, Steve.
<s> From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
<s> Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
<s> It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
<s> Thanks, Steve.
<s> Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
<s> Wife?!
<s> In room "302" at ten o'clock?
<s> Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
<s> Okay... maybe that would be best.
<s> Never happened!
<s> Would you die already?!
<s> Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
<s> No, stay.
<s> Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
<s> He's so brave.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
<s> Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
<s> No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
<s> I know, but I've been thinking --
<s> Look, what I'm trying to say --
<s> That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
<s> Thanks, I'll be fine.
<s> So, whatever happened to her?
<s> It's okay.
<s> It's the sequel.
<s> Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
<s> Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
<s> This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
<s> Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
<s> Not in a thousand years.
<s> Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
<s> Yes!!!!
<s> I'll go.
<s> Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
<s> Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
<s> Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
<s> What are you getting at, Professor?
<s> There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
<s> Saw who?!
<s> I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
<s> Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
<s> They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
<s> How are we going to get them all up there?
<s> In about fifteen minutes.
<s> Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
<s> Yes, I thought that it would be best.
<s> Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
<s> Just a little Rogaine.
<s> That's right.
<s> Alright. Come on, you guys.
<s> Second best.
<s> I guess so.
<s> How is she?
<s> Get out?! What does it say?
<s> I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
<s> It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
<s> Mother? 
<s> You said you hated him.
<s> Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
<s> Why?
<s> I don't feel like rewinding it!
<s> Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
<s> Let me see!
<s> Oh Mom...
<s> Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
<s> This is so silly. 
<s> You mean for TV or print?
<s> I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
<s> Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
<s> And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
<s> Don't I get a kiss?
<s> Oh, honey!
<s> Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
<s> Is this the Cocksucker residence?
<s> Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
<s> Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
<s> It's not fair!!
<s> Socially... I'll have a beer.
<s> NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
<s> We all have bad nights. 
<s> I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
<s> Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
<s> We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
<s> Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Drink.
<s> You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
<s> As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.
<s> Hello, Frances.
<s> I did her hair.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Why?
<s> Good.
<s> I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, I'm making investigations.
<s> Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
<s> We've tried so long to find her.
<s> Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
<s> We could tell him.
<s> And then?
<s> You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
<s> You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
<s> Yes.
<s> But you're always at the library.
<s> I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
<s> And Gregory -- he loves her.
<s> I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
<s> My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
<s> But why come to me?
<s> Uhhuh.
<s> It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
<s> I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
<s> Perhaps
<s> It might have.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
<s> Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
<s> Unless what?
<s> And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
<s> Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
<s> Yes?
<s> What?
<s> When?
<s> I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
<s> I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
<s> False alarm.
<s> Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
<s> Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
<s> Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
<s> Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
<s> Nine years.
<s> I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
<s> Kids? What about them?
<s> Impotent.
<s> They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
<s> You had sex with you therapist?
<s> Well, I wasn't always impotent.
<s> That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
<s> Ann. Hello.
<s> Nothing I can't finish later.
<s> What kind of personal project?
<s> Why not?
<s> Everything about sex.
<s> Maybe you want to go.
<s> Why not?
<s> What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
<s> Then do it.
<s> I have money.
<s> It won't. Are you ready?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I fantasized about you.
<s> Yes.
<s> You said you weren't always impotent.
<s> Who was the last person you had sex with?
<s> Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
<s> I'm not in love with you.
<s> That's very flattering.
<s> But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
<s> Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
<s> All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
<s> You did that?
<s> That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
<s> Who'd you have lunch with?
<s> Isn't therapy helping at all?
<s> Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
<s> We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
<s> No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
<s> Yeah, so?
<s> No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
<s> Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
<s> So it was recently that you tried this.
<s> The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
<s> That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
<s> I guess.
<s> Why, so you can go after him?
<s> What's wrong with that?
<s> Will you stop? Jesus.
<s> What kinds of questions?
<s> You are in trouble.
<s> You are in serious trouble.
<s> It looks like a tablecloth.
<s> Hold on.
<s> There's a phone here.
<s> I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
<s> Yes.
<s> Just a moment.
<s> My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
<s> When I was fourteen.
<s> Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
<s> Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
<s> Hi.
<s> Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
<s> So make an exception.
<s> I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
<s> I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
<s> I did.
<s> Cynthia. John.
<s> Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
<s> I wish you hadn't done that.
<s> How about for five hundred?
<s> You were prying before?
<s> I'm not going to give you my keys.
<s> Brian Kirkland, please.
<s> Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
<s> All right, jesus.
<s> Was he nice to you?
<s> Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
<s> How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
<s> Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
<s> C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
<s> I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
<s> Nick, you're so strange...
<s> Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
<s> I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
<s> Just breathe normally.
<s> Gonna cut me open?
<s> You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
<s> Well, at least you still talk the same.
<s> But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
<s> Who was she?
<s> That you, Rog?
<s> Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
<s> OK, Rog. See you at ten.
<s> BREAKING OUT
<s> BREAKING OUT
<s> Fools!
<s> I got it!  I got it!!!
<s> I've caught it once or twice.
<s> After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
<s> I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
<s> Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
<s> Now Betty, don't overreact.
<s> Indulge?
<s> What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
<s> YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
<s> He was adopted you know.
<s> Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
<s> The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
<s> What show?
<s> OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
<s> YOUNG BLOOD
<s> No...couldn't I do this later?
<s> Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> Flavors!
<s> Fabulous!
<s> Fast!
<s> Foods!
<s> We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
<s> SIN-I-FUL
<s> LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
<s> Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
<s> I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
<s> I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
<s> So I guess that's it.
<s> You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
<s> A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
<s> Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
<s> I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
<s> Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
<s> Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
<s> In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Not so bad yourself.
<s> Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
<s> No, we're paying for the wine.
<s> Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
<s> She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> And Lexapro, yes.
<s> Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
<s> Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
<s> Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
<s> Want some?
<s> Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
<s> You know her?
<s> This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
<s> And she likes Pinot.
<s> Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
<s> How do you know?
<s> Shut up.
<s> Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
<s> Miles.
<s> I want to go home now.
<s> I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
<s> You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
<s> I'm a quick learner.
<s> Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
<s> With Maya?
<s> I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
<s> Aye-aye, captain.
<s> If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
<s> I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
<s> Understanding of what?
<s> In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
<s> Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
<s> What? Of course I like Christine.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
<s> Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
<s> What exactly are we going to do?
<s> He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
<s> Let's leave it alone.
<s> Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
<s> No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
<s> Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
<s> Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
<s> Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
<s> You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
<s> What?
<s> Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
<s> Hrnrnrn?
<s> I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
<s> You need a new car anyway.
<s> Why don't you come in?
<s> Twelve months in oak.
<s> That's what I'm having.
<s> Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
<s> Yeah. Definitely.
<s> "The Day After Yesterday."
<s> My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
<s> Like what a fraud he was.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Good. So did I.
<s> Well, nice to see you now.
<s> Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
<s> Do you know what he's been saying to her?
<s> So what's happening with your book?
<s> This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
<s> I told you I need a drink.
<s> Exactement!
<s> Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
<s> Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
<s> No dad!
<s> Me too.
<s> What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
<s> Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
<s> Curse and stuff.
<s> You want him coming in the house next time?
<s> I heard.
<s> Yes, it was.
<s> That's right.
<s> That wasn't the answer you wanted?
<s> Yes.
<s> They already know we're here.
<s> We have to go in the basement.
<s> Got it!
<s> Me too.
<s> A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
<s> It's old Morgan.
<s> I just asked his name.
<s> Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
<s> Sounds made up.
<s> We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
<s> Yeah baby. I think someone did.
<s> Don't call me Father.
<s> There are none.
<s> It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
<s> He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
<s> What did you say?
<s> No money, eh?
<s> What friend is that?
<s> There's nobody coming?
<s> Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
<s> Where were you?
<s> Yeah... maybe. So long.
<s> Someplace safe. How you feeling?
<s> She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
<s> Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
<s> That's why I'm here.
<s> How's Mr. Parker doing?
<s> And they were two of them. Look --
<s> Ten A.M.
<s> I haven't done anything.
<s> I'll be long gone.
<s> I had to get up anyway.
<s> Where's Turley?
<s> I expect.
<s> He is that.
<s> Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
<s> Anybody got any ideas?
<s> Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
<s> I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
<s> And a pretty lady.
<s> Why?
<s> His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
<s> I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
<s> He'll be here.
<s> That ain't right.
<s> We'd rather stay.
<s> So this is the guy you're going to hang?
<s> What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
<s> Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
<s> Why would they stop you?
<s> He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
<s> So we understand each other?
<s> Yeah, maybe I will too.
<s> I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
<s> Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
<s> I wouldn't worry about that.
<s> Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
<s> -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
<s> -- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
<s> Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
<s> So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
<s> Good to see you too, Elaine.
<s> I don't know if that's going to happen.
<s> As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
<s> She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
<s> "Forever".
<s> If it's on the page...
<s> She'll drive herself.
<s> I'll send you her resume.
<s> No need.  She does all her own stunts.
<s> Simone does not control my destiny.
<s> Better late than never.
<s> Everyone you know is lying.
<s> You're so good to protect her like this.
<s> She said you were very beautiful.
<s> Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
<s> No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
<s> No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
<s> How can you bring that up at a time like this?
<s> Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
<s> It was a great show, Dad...
<s> Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
<s> ... so much like her?
<s> I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
<s> Do what you do to Simone.
<s> You don't secretly want the attention?
<s> And what may I ask brought this on?
<s> Really?  She didn't mention it.
<s> It was more in passing.
<s> Body double.
<s> But she's right there!  I must feel her!
<s> Why not?
<s> -- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
<s> Good for you, Hank.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I've seen them all before.
<s> Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
<s> I need flesh and --
<s> That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
<s> I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
<s> I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
<s> I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
<s> I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
<s> Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
<s> I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
<s> If anyone asks about Simone --
<s> I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
<s> Night, Lainey.
<s> I do okay.  How about you?
<s> Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
<s> I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
<s> It's a yacht.
<s> -- I bet you have.
<s> Er,... good.
<s> Don't you?
<s> Why?
<s> What do you want -- ?
<s> Is that why she left you?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
<s> ... digitized.
<s> Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
<s> Yes.  Yes, it is.
<s> Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
<s> What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
<s> Tell me.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> That's good.
<s> You saw that on T.V., Cole?
<s> I guess they don't.
<s> See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
<s> You mean aneurysm.
<s> Words.
<s> I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
<s> Them?
<s> Don't fail me.
<s> Yes, it did.
<s> Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
<s> Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
<s> Where will you go, where no one has died?
<s> Tell you my secrets.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Standing next to my window.
<s> ...I don't know.
<s> They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
<s> You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
<s> --Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
<s> Let's say today, we make it your business.
<s> You were a beat and a quarter behind.
<s> Tramp.
<s> Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
<s> Not according to these.
<s> The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
<s> Sorry.
<s> You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
<s> Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
<s> He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
<s> Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
<s> Bus broke down.
<s> Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
<s> Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
<s> I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
<s> It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
<s> "-- an AXE!"
<s> Amends...?
<s> I --
<s> Not while you're driving.
<s> Who you callin' "boy?"
<s> You got something against farm people, Keith?
<s> He's right. You were behind.
<s> Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
<s> Then why go back now?
<s> Nah. Just you.
<s> You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
<s> Spider.
<s> Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
<s> That's not funny.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
<s> He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
<s> Okay.
<s> That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
<s> Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
<s> Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
<s> Out.
<s> My present?
<s> You're pretty.
<s> Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
<s> What other stuff?
<s> And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
<s> An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
<s> Hey, look!
<s> Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
<s> Last year, this was a new rig.
<s> A what?
<s> Okay.
<s> Whaddya want to know? My sign?
<s> Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
<s> Would I lie to you?
<s> I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
<s> Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
<s> He's after us again!
<s> Yeah.
<s> You plan on driving trucks all your life?
<s> Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
<s> Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
<s> Well, thanks for the lift.
<s> That man is your father?!?
<s> You gotta admire the man's determination.
<s> See ya, Kate.
<s> Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
<s> Another time.
<s> Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
<s> And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
<s> I don't know, man. Ask him?
<s> But I still don't think...
<s> Running blocker.
<s> On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
<s> What's your twenty?
<s> If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
<s> Now what?
<s> I'm cucumber cool.
<s> Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
<s> But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
<s> Go head on, breaker.
<s> What's up, Dixie Chicken?
<s> Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
<s> About one to five years worth.
<s> You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
<s> I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
<s> Then it must be a helluva idea.
<s> Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
<s> Now, you just find him, son.
<s> Chickenshit money.
<s> -- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
<s> -- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
<s> That's correct.
<s> No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
<s> Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
<s> Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
<s> -- he was wearing one of our jackets.
<s> Uh, yeah.
<s> Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
<s> And threw us into the lake.
<s> Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
<s> I sent Hugo, he should be there!
<s> The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
<s> Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
<s> Your attitude sucks.
<s> Okay.
<s> Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
<s> I was kinda hoping, yeah.
<s> That's right! RIGHT NOW!
<s> ...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
<s> This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> -- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
<s> It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
<s> But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
<s> Yeah... Sid?
<s> -- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
<s> A million flat.
<s> Got hit twice.
<s> 'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
<s> I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
<s> I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
<s> C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
<s> What?
<s> ...What are they doin' right now...?
<s> Didn't you talk to Snow?
<s> Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
<s> It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Where's Sartorius?
<s> Oh, that's a relief.
<s> That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
<s> She drank liquid oxygen.
<s> Get out --
<s> Into what?
<s> I won't be making the trip.
<s> As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
<s> You don't know?
<s> I think so.
<s> I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
<s> He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
<s> That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
<s> I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
<s> He is.  But he was here...
<s> It's all right.
<s> You should have told me.
<s> Neither did I.
<s> I never said I didn't.
<s> Then you won't make it.
<s> Am I really her?
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
<s> I'm not Snow.
<s> You didn't like him?
<s> You still writing the occasional magazine article?
<s> Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
<s> Hard to find doors in this place.
<s> Queens... You know Queens?
<s> Beg pardon?
<s> Not too sure about that.
<s> I'll come with you.
<s> I came on at 8:00.
<s> Listen, that was my fault.
<s> Hmm...
<s> Could be, I guess.
<s> He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
<s> This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
<s> Oh God, that's great!
<s> Do you dance?
<s> Mike...?
<s> So.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Nothing.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> What?
<s> Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
<s> I can still use a gun.
<s> I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
<s> Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
<s> No.
<s> I just sat and listened.
<s> When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
<s> If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
<s> I heard.
<s> Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
<s> I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
<s> I'm not lettin' no one go.
<s> My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
<s> Okay, I guess.
<s> So, what are you doing tonight?
<s> Shooting?
<s> I don't think she can sing, either.
<s> At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
<s> No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
<s> -- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
<s> See?
<s> A little bunny I saved from dissection.
<s> You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
<s> Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
<s> Lemme down, bugface!
<s> Get away from me, freak!
<s> Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
<s> You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
<s> Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
<s> Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
<s> I-- uh--
<s> I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
<s> Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
<s> Does it have a human name?
<s> Hi, Adele.
<s> That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
<s> Do you mind if I come too?
<s> So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
<s> I know what you mean.  I...
<s> Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
<s> Nah.
<s> But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
<s> Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
<s> It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
<s> Precise equipment such as waldos
<s> That's the understatement of the year.
<s> Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
<s> Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
<s> You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
<s> I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
<s> I will finish what I've begun
<s> Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
<s> Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
<s> Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
<s> What?
<s> I just gave-- yeah, sure.
<s> Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
<s> Plenty.
<s> Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
<s> I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
<s> There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
<s> Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
<s> That'll do.
<s> We'll get some more.
<s> Who is it?
<s> So long, Sefton.
<s> No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
<s> Anybody here wanna double their bet?
<s> Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
<s> Take it.
<s> We're looking at it.
<s> Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
<s> Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
<s> Tipping me off? I do not understand.
<s> You are talking crazy!
<s> What is your number?
<s> No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
<s> I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
<s> Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
<s> They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
<s> Then droppen Sie dead!
<s> Some are not bad at all.
<s> Stop it, Harry!
<s> Why do you do this to me every morning?
<s> Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
<s> I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
<s> Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
<s> Me? What if she don't want me?
<s> No?
<s> He's the grrrrreatest!
<s> I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
<s> So what? There's other women!
<s> Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
<s> She'll never forgive me!
<s> You hold him. I'll slug him.
<s> I'll open mine, too.
<s> It's that song, Harry!
<s> Why, sure!
<s> Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
<s> Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
<s> It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
<s> You starting that again?
<s> Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
<s> Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
<s> Nothing for Kuzawa?
<s> What about the radio?
<s> Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
<s> Thirty-fifth.
<s> Give me the radio.
<s> How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
<s> No! No!
<s> Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
<s> We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
<s> Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
<s> When is it expected back?
<s> Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
<s> I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
<s> I have to find a way to get to Soran.
<s> No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
<s> That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
<s> I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
<s> It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
<s> I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
<s> One minute to warp core breach.
<s> On screen.
<s> Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
<s> It's our pleasure.
<s> Oh, of course.
<s> Yes, yes, it is.
<s> You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
<s> Phasing? To where?
<s> I was ordered to by the Captain.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
<s> When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
<s> No, sir.
<s> You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
<s> In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
<s> Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
<s> All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
<s> If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
<s> I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
<s> Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
<s> Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
<s> Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
<s> Nothing. As before.
<s> What did you see, Chekov?
<s> Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
<s> Scotty...?
<s> Locate.
<s> On screen.
<s> I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
<s> There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
<s> A photon tube...!
<s> Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
<s> Logic indicates that is the case.
<s> That may be difficult...
<s> It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
<s> Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
<s> I'll go...
<s> You said there wouldn't be any.
<s> Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
<s> I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
<s> I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
<s> Scan for vessels in pursuit!
<s> Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
<s> This Vulcan -- is he alive?
<s> He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
<s> What? What are you saying?
<s> But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
<s> What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
<s> Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
<s> Fire, Mr. Scott!
<s> Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
<s> Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
<s> Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
<s> Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
<s> 
<s> Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
<s> You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
<s> Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
<s> Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
<s> You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
<s> I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
<s> Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
<s> Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
<s> Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
<s> They outnumber us, my Lord --
<s> Yes, my lord!
<s> I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
<s> Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
<s> You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
<s> Good for you, Lieutenant.
<s> I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
<s> They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
<s> The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
<s> I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
<s> And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
<s> Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
<s> En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
<s> I have my orders.
<s> Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
<s> Why? Why didn't you tell me?
<s> And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
<s> Maybe...
<s> Never mind! Hurry!
<s> <u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
<s> <u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
<s> I'm Doctor Marcus!
<s> She's making it up! My father was Professor --
<s> The Admiral's son.
<s> Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
<s> Visual --
<s> <u>Full power damn you</u>!
<s> Inoperative.
<s> Listen to me -- you men and women --
<s> Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
<s> Try the emergency channels...
<s> I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
<s> Admiral, this is Spock.
<s> Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
<s> You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
<s> I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
<s> The power of creation --
<s> Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
<s> Aye sir --
<s> Uhura, patch me in --
<s> ... No, sir. It has not.
<s> You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
<s> You may ask, Lieutenant.
<s> Erased...
<s> On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
<s> I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Understood, sir.
<s> As you were, Mr. Saavik.
<s> I'll try, Captain.
<s> Course heading, Captain?
<s> Honors -- hup!
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> I exaggerated.
<s> You do this -- for friendship?
<s> Gillian --
<s> We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
<s> It'll come back to him.
<s> No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
<s> We've done it before.
<s> If you have a better idea - now's the time.
<s> Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
<s> Cramps.
<s> Come on, Pavel...
<s> ... My shoes...
<s> I liked him better before he died.
<s> Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
<s> Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
<s> Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
<s> Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
<s> Like what?
<s> I'm wery sorry, but --
<s> We are launching everything we have.
<s> It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
<s> You've already been that. C'mon.
<s> Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
<s> A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> It's his way.
<s> See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
<s> No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
<s> All right. The truth?
<s> Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
<s> Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
<s> Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
<s> But Kirk...
<s> Kirk. They're gone.
<s> Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
<s> What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
<s> All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
<s> ... You have a point...
<s> Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
<s> As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
<s> That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
<s> There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
<s> In progress, Admiral.
<s> What is our target in time?
<s> How do you know this...?
<s> Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
<s> Yes?
<s> I cannot tell a lie.
<s> Exaggerate.
<s> They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
<s> Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
<s> Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
<s> Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
<s> Go, Mr. Sulu.
<s> 283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
<s> Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
<s> Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
<s> The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
<s> On my way...!
<s> Admiral, you'll be trapped!
<s> Well, that's different.
<s> I will. Can my assistant come, too?
<s> Sill? What else would I be working with?
<s> ... Are you joking?
<s> I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
<s> Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
<s> It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
<s> Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
<s> I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
<s> We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
<s> You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
<s> When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
<s> This way!
<s> I aspire to be more than I am.
<s> Perhaps, that is true.
<s> Really?
<s> Androids... don't have...fun.
<s> Bye.
<s> Data doesn't breathe.
<s> Are they in any danger?
<s> Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
<s> Is it safe to move her?
<s> What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
<s> He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
<s> ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
<s> Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
<s> Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
<s> Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
<s> Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
<s> If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
<s> If we could lure him away from the bridge...
<s> Recommendations?
<s> We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
<s> The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
<s> How long 'til they reach us?
<s> Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
<s> Deck ten.
<s> You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
<s> Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
<s> Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
<s> It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
<s> Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
<s> No, sir...
<s> No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
<s> Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
<s> Is there any other way to disable the injector?
<s> Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
<s> Why was Data assigned?
<s> Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
<s> What...?
<s> Or you could try lying down.
<s> All ship functions are off-line.
<s> Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
<s> Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
<s> Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
<s> Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
<s> Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
<s> It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
<s> I wish to... go back to the way I was.
<s> What?
<s> Where's the Sphere?
<s> According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
<s> Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
<s> Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
<s> Understood. Keep me informed.
<s> It'll have to wait. Come on.
<s> I'm on it...
<s> Ready.
<s> Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
<s> There's a few of us left.
<s> I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
<s> I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
<s> The invasion plans.
<s> And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
<s> Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
<s> Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
<s> We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
<s> Data, set a course for that vortex.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Unless you'd like to stay.
<s> Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
<s> They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
<s> Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
<s> The charge is murder.
<s> Vulcans sleep lying down...
<s> We DO sleep lying down.
<s> We've been set up all along.
<s> We're not finished.
<s> I didn't mean this future.
<s> No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
<s> If they're even looking for us...
<s> And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
<s> Now there's a poser.
<s> Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
<s> Stand...?
<s> I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
<s> You feign ignorance?
<s> Yes...
<s> Well, I -
<s> Your honors, the State rests.
<s> Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
<s> Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
<s> Who else?
<s> Shields up. Battle stations.
<s> Now we go to Starfleet?
<s> Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
<s> We must do this again soon.
<s> They'll be here...
<s> Kill him! He's the one!!
<s> Energize...
<s> Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
<s> Right -
<s> Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
<s> I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
<s> Sulu!
<s> When does this conference start?
<s> Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
<s> I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
<s> We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
<s> Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
<s> You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
<s> Spock, you want to know something?
<s> I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
<s> Faith...?
<s> Such things have happened before, sir.
<s> Not as yet, sir.
<s> Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
<s> I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> You having hearing problems, mister?
<s> We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
<s> That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
<s> This one can.
<s> At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
<s> You are me.
<s> No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
<s> You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
<s> You're working late.
<s> But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
<s> I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
<s> That was another time.
<s> Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
<s> I can see that.
<s> Aye, sir... This way.
<s> He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
<s> No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
<s> I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
<s> Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
<s> It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
<s> Emergency force fields are holding.
<s> The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
<s> And I you.
<s> I know how he thinks.
<s> Counselor?
<s> Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
<s> When this is over, I owe you a drink.
<s> Understood.
<s> This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
<s> Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Ready, sir!
<s> I'll take care of it, sir.
<s> There's more... as always. He's Reman.
<s> Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
<s> Who was it?
<s> On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
<s> Thank you, sir...
<s> Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
<s> She's a predator.
<s> His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
<s> And the Romulans invade.
<s> We can only hope so.
<s> She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
<s> I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
<s> Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
<s> Yes.
<s> Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
<s> There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
<s> Yes.
<s> New worlds.
<s> Age before rank, Jean Luc.
<s> In time.
<s> Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
<s> I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
<s> We are.
<s> You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
<s> Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
<s> It is... invigorating.
<s> Find her again.
<s> Do as I tell you!
<s> You don't have to understand.
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> No, we can handle this.
<s> How much are your rooms?
<s> We should have. Let me see.
<s> I understand.
<s> I make maps.
<s> It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
<s> There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
<s> Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
<s> It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
<s> I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
<s> George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
<s> Washington thinks it's too late for that.
<s> This is George Fox...
<s> Marc Shermin.
<s> Don't... don't do this... please...
<s> Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
<s> Dashboard.
<s> That way.
<s> Minneapolis.
<s> You're full of tricks, aren't you?
<s> Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
<s> I am Jenny Haydn.
<s> Space?
<s> I know.
<s> Candy.
<s> You want to try it?
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> When we get here.
<s> Is that a baby?
<s> Why?
<s> I know that. But the buses don't go there.
<s> I do not speak English.
<s> Can I have the gun?
<s> It was a mistake.
<s> He will.
<s> I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
<s> That was beautiful.
<s> I must meet my ship.
<s> You can stop. I will go on alone.
<s> I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
<s> I know how to gamble now.
<s> I understand.
<s> Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
<s> If you want to keep it, you can.
<s> Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
<s> I will.
<s> You could have killed us both!!
<s> It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
<s> Don't worry. I'll be all right.
<s> Get Fox.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
<s> Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
<s> Wait'll you see it.
<s> It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
<s> It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
<s> Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
<s> No.
<s> Judy, that's stupid.
<s> You know that's impossible!
<s> You saw that?
<s> I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
<s> A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
<s> I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
<s> My God.
<s> 'We might as well make the best of it.'
<s> Watch and see.
<s> Forget it's there.
<s> I just got to talk to you for one second.
<s> Tonight.
<s> It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
<s> What?  He gonna record you on his label?
<s> Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
<s> Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
<s> We should talk alone.
<s> Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
<s> Thanks, Max.
<s> Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
<s> Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
<s> I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
<s> Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
<s> You bet.  Did you like it?
<s> Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
<s> That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
<s> Strickland.
<s> Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
<s> Define illegal.
<s> Fumitsu.
<s> Get it.
<s> Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
<s> Black.  Jack.
<s> So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> So the guy's not a sicko.
<s> S'okay.  I know you still love me.
<s> It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
<s> I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
<s> Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
<s> It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
<s> And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
<s> You never told me.
<s> No, it's not.
<s> No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
<s> Uh unh.
<s> Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
<s> See you downtown.
<s> Aw, Mom!
<s> Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
<s> Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
<s> To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
<s> The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
<s> Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
<s> You're thinking...?
<s> This isn't in our database?
<s> I'm sorry. This won't take long.
<s> I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
<s> You must travel a lot, huh?
<s> Whole country or just hereabouts?
<s> Why me? What do you want from me!?
<s> What kind?
<s> Put a BOLO out on that.
<s> I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
<s> If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
<s> I don't believe this.
<s> You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
<s> I understand.
<s> What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
<s> You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
<s> They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
<s> This is some serious shit.
<s> Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
<s> Don't be too harsh.
<s> Huh?
<s> Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
<s> "Intra-Agency fraternizing."
<s> What did you tell him?
<s> We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
<s> Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
<s> No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
<s> That's true.
<s> Not the way I can.
<s> Jaime? Where are you?
<s> And you're working with him?
<s> It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
<s> Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
<s> Low calls him Suspect Zero.
<s> Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
<s> Zero killed them all?
<s> Maybe you should back off.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
<s> [Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
<s> [You tell me.]
<s> So you're the new meat?
<s> Sounds like fun.
<s> I screwed up twice, sir.
<s> Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
<s> Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
<s> No. Stop, come on.
<s> What kind of car do you drive?
<s> I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
<s> What's that like?
<s> Yes. Like the quiche.
<s> Just like that?
<s> How was it hard?
<s> What what? What advantages?
<s> Anything.
<s> Why not? This place is dead anyway.
<s> I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
<s> Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
<s> They were auditioning for the same role as you?
<s> I'm a "Dorothy".
<s> ...And she's with someone else.
<s> I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
<s> Could you believe it?
<s> Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
<s> Sorry?
<s> Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
<s> No...
<s> Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
<s> Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
<s> Hi, Mike?
<s> Are you on the other line?
<s> I can call back...
<s> Fine... I guess. You?
<s> What kind of things?
<s> ...the Michelin commercial...
<s> I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
<s> Right.
<s> It sucks.
<s> There's the rub.
<s> Hey man, don't sweat it.
<s> I didn't want to say anything.
<s> I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
<s> I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
<s> I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
<s> Ah, there's the rub...
<s> I just tested for one...
<s> You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
<s> Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
<s> What's the point?
<s> Oh boy.
<s> Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
<s> Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
<s> You always know the right thing to say.
<s> Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
<s> What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
<s> What are they doing here?
<s> Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
<s> Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
<s> Wow, I guess you were home... 
<s> I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
<s> I don't know...
<s> Just bring your card. Half an hour.
<s> I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
<s> Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
<s> Vegas.
<s> Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
<s> Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
<s> ...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
<s> But I lost! How can you say always?!?
<s> Thanks for clarifying that.
<s> Yea, how much?
<s> What an asshole.
<s> She smiled, baby.
<s> She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
<s> Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
<s> Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
<s> Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
<s> Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
<s> How?
<s> Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
<s> Aww... He got away?
<s> It's on.
<s> What a surprise.
<s> No, baby!
<s> What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
<s> They're a finesse team...
<s> You think?
<s> ...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
<s> Now go over there and get those digits.
<s> ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
<s> What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
<s> ...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
<s> I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
<s> Be smart about it.
<s> You don't have to wait three days...
<s> ...just be smart about it.
<s> Our little baby's growing up...
<s> I ask for Justice.
<s> Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
<s> Barzini.
<s> How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
<s> No, just you and Paulie.
<s> How bad will it be?
<s> What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
<s> Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
<s> The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
<s> Sure.
<s> On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
<s> They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
<s> It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
<s> Yes.
<s> I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
<s> I'm going to finish school.
<s> Then why have I become a man like you?
<s> I'll need him.
<s> How?
<s> Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
<s> You want him to stay in this country.
<s> You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
<s> No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
<s> The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
<s> How do you know I come from America?
<s> He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
<s> You look good, too.
<s> Mike!
<s> The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
<s> Okay.  One minute.
<s> The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
<s> I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
<s> Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
<s> We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
<s> Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
<s> I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
<s> Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
<s> How do you do.
<s> No.
<s> I'm thinking about it.
<s> OK. 
<s> I'm busy.
<s> On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
<s> What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
<s> Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
<s> I do renounce him.
<s> I do wish to be baptized.
<s> He talked to you?
<s> Do you recognize my voice?
<s> I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
<s> Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
<s> You just woke up!
<s> Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
<s> I don't get it.
<s> I don't like you.
<s> Oh, it was.
<s> Yes please!
<s> It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
<s> It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
<s> Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
<s> I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
<s> Marge! You've got to hear this!
<s> I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
<s> This is so good of you.
<s> I played piano in a few places.
<s> A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
<s> Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
<s> I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
<s> Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
<s> Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
<s> You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
<s> Ripley's plans.
<s> Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
<s> No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
<s> I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
<s> Really? To Italy?
<s> Oh God, I don't think so.
<s> Tom, I don't love you.
<s> Sure.
<s> Dickie?
<s> I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
<s> No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
<s> Have you done something to your hair?
<s> What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
<s> Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
<s> We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
<s> Where's Mr MacCarron?
<s> Such as?
<s> Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
<s> Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
<s> Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'll go and see what's the matter.
<s> Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
<s> Marge, when did you get here?
<s> Dickie did it.
<s> Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
<s> What?
<s> Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
<s> How did you know that?
<s> Is Freddie in Rome?
<s> I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
<s> Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
<s> Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
<s> Just kidding. Are you alone?
<s> They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
<s> He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
<s> He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
<s> Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
<s> Not at all. Morning Tom.
<s> It's okay.
<s> No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
<s> Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
<s> Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
<s> You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
<s> You try. You try talking to her.
<s> All kinds of things. Making plans.
<s> Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
<s> Was who Meredith?
<s> Yes?
<s> I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
<s> And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
<s> Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
<s> Who mam?
<s> Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
<s> I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
<s> It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
<s> I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
<s> Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
<s> No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
<s> I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
<s> He'll, what else can I do with it all?
<s> My God!
<s> It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
<s> Hello, Betsy.
<s> Sure.
<s> With who?
<s> That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
<s> That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
<s> This is gotta be a game, right?
<s> You sure he's not Italian?
<s> What is it? I'm busy.
<s> We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
<s> Could you see anything?
<s> The cops and company raise hell they find out.
<s> Stick up?
<s> I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
<s> I don't like my real name.
<s> I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
<s> It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
<s> Oh, come off it, man.
<s> Where is home?
<s> He looks like a killer.
<s> I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
<s> You just gonna leave 'em?
<s> Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
<s> Yes I am.
<s> Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know. I tried that.
<s> I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
<s> Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
<s> Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
<s> You would, huh?
<s> Your name Sport?
<s> Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
<s> Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
<s> Things got ya down?
<s> It happens.
<s> Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
<s> Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
<s> Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
<s> No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
<s> It's all I could think of.
<s> The cell, Mason.
<s> Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
<s> The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
<s> Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
<s> I am, too.
<s> Okay.  What's the second thing?
<s> Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
<s> No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
<s> Well...
<s> You mean,  me?
<s> No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
<s> You look... different.
<s> Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
<s> Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
<s> You must not remember anything. Come on.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Nothing.  
<s> I'm  fine.  Really.  
<s> Have you got a cigarette?
<s> I don't smoke?
<s> Oh.
<s> Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
<s> Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
<s> Yes.
<s> Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
<s> Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
<s> I'm not refuting anything.
<s> I do.
<s> I... I need a drink of water.
<s> Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
<s> Well, son, you're home!
<s> No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
<s> You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
<s> I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
<s> Good to meet you.  Again.
<s> Thanks.
<s> That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
<s> Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
<s> Harry, son.  Harry.
<s> Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
<s> Mother.  She's beautiful.
<s> Who... are they?
<s> ... Ernie.
<s> Dad, I...
<s> Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
<s> Anybody take it?
<s> You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
<s> I guess I did.
<s> I... no, I... I just can't...
<s> No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
<s> Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
<s> I'm not sorry for what I said.
<s> Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
<s> When was that?
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh...
<s> Yes.  Very.
<s> No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
<s> They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes?
<s> It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
<s> I think so.
<s> I despise it.
<s> Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
<s> When was this?
<s> Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
<s> Afraid I'd give Mitch.
<s> I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
<s> It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
<s> If your father were here...
<s> Take them.
<s> Your brother told me.
<s> I know.
<s> I don't know, honey.
<s> Is she all right?
<s> Shhh. Shhhhh.
<s> Yep.
<s> Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
<s> Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
<s> Impossible.
<s> Shall I call the doctor?
<s> No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
<s> Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
<s> Yes, very.
<s> Yes.
<s> I told you. We met yesterday.
<s> I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
<s> Yes, Mother.
<s> I know, Mother.
<s> I don't know when.  We'll see what...
<s> You're doing fine.
<s> But they'll be back.
<s> We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
<s> If they are?
<s> I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
<s> I think it might also matter to Mitch.
<s> Did you close the door?
<s> Shhhh. Shhhh.
<s> We know what it is, Al.
<s> Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
<s> Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
<s> No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
<s> Yes.
<s> Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
<s> I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
<s> Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
<s> Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
<s> I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
<s> That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
<s> I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
<s> Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
<s> Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
<s> You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
<s> Why would I want to see you, of all people?
<s> It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
<s> None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
<s> I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
<s> Seven o'clock then.
<s> San Francisco's a long way from here.
<s> Oh. That. Rome.
<s> I told you what happened in Rome!
<s> Why?
<s> Cheers.
<s> What do you do?
<s> Like what?
<s> What'll it say?
<s> No, tell me.
<s> Take wing!
<s> After the gulls attacked.
<s> It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
<s> Don't let's take any chances.
<s> It may not be last week again for a long long time.
<s> How about you?
<s> No... wait.  Hold me.
<s> Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
<s> Well, all right, but...
<s> What were the crows after at the school?
<s> Daniels. I think they were after the children.
<s> It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
<s> ...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
<s> Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
<s> Of course.
<s> Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
<s> Good morning.
<s> I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
<s> But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
<s> Aye.
<s> MacFarlane
<s> You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
<s> From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
<s> Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
<s> I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
<s> That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> Why, yes.
<s> The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
<s> One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
<s> I can't.
<s> I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
<s> That's a good boy, Toddy.
<s> You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
<s> I've had some experience.
<s> What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
<s> Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
<s> There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
<s> I take no gifts from you.
<s> But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
<s> I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
<s> I know --
<s> We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
<s> Aye --
<s> You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
<s> No great lady will ever take my place?
<s> He must leave me alone.
<s> I'm looking for my friends.
<s> You're wrong.
<s> I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
<s> Yeah. I sure will.
<s> I think we should get some support?
<s> A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
<s> Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
<s> The scar.
<s> I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
<s> When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
<s> My father.
<s> I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
<s> It's what Lauren would do.
<s> I know.
<s> Could say that.
<s> Not tonight. Honest.
<s> I want you... to bend over.
<s> Honey. I just can't.
<s> The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
<s> That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
<s> It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
<s> That was my first question.
<s> I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
<s> Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
<s> I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
<s> I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
<s> Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
<s> I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
<s> No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
<s> Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
<s> I shouldn't be at all surprised.
<s> You're just kidding, aren't you?
<s> He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
<s> Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
<s> Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
<s> Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
<s> We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
<s> Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
<s> Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
<s> He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
<s> He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
<s> About five months -- your months.
<s> This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
<s> The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
<s> Thank you... Have you any news?
<s> I can judge only by what I see.
<s> I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
<s> There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
<s> I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
<s> Is it real?
<s> Come on in.
<s> I don't care about the rest of the world!
<s> May I see you for a minute?
<s> Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
<s> There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
<s> We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
<s> I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
<s> This one could save your life.
<s> It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
<s> Can't stand light?
<s> We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
<s> Zero.
<s> El Vampiro.
<s> Honda 250, huh?
<s> C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
<s> No.  Stick around.
<s> That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
<s> To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
<s> Chill out Edgar.
<s> That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
<s> What?
<s> If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
<s> 'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
<s> You have a T.V.?
<s> Lots more where he came from.
<s> Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
<s> No.  Just you.
<s> I like Michael.
<s> No.  I'm up.
<s> I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
<s> He's already gone to bed.
<s> Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
<s> This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
<s> But, Mom...
<s> Mom!
<s> Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
<s> Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
<s> It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
<s> Star.
<s> Michael's great.  I like Michael.
<s> I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
<s> Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
<s> It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
<s> I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
<s> Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
<s> What about Mom?
<s> Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
<s> I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
<s> Anybody sick?
<s> Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
<s> Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
<s> Now who'd go and do...
<s> Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
<s> I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
<s> It's shorted out or something!
<s> Probably the next meal.
<s> But...
<s> What clothes?
<s> What do you mean "you think so?"
<s> Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
<s> If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
<s> Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
<s> Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
<s> What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
<s> You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
<s> Blair.  He's gone berserk.
<s> Move it, Palmer.
<s> Can you think of any other tests?
<s> Why?
<s> It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
<s> What are you going to do?  Drink it?
<s> Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
<s> Hear what?
<s> Can't hear you.
<s> I had an accident.
<s> We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
<s> No...
<s> How did you know?!
<s> Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
<s> Excuse me?
<s> It was meant to.
<s> The Morlocks didn't build this.
<s> End...?
<s> I will...
<s> When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
<s> Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
<s> Why is it -- breaking up?
<s> I need to... um... talk to you.
<s> Holding you... again.
<s> I need... to talk to you.
<s> I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
<s> The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
<s> I have something for you...
<s> How romantic...
<s> That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
<s> That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Yes...
<s> Your husband is dead?
<s> More than 800,000 years.
<s> For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
<s> Thank you.
<s> Or mud carriers.
<s> How do you decide?
<s> You liked it there.
<s> It must have been safe.
<s> I see.
<s> New Yorkers.
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
<s> Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
<s> They've gone to a better place.
<s> You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
<s> What's it like where you come from?
<s> I am.  Are you a climber?
<s> They're inside --
<s> I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
<s> What about Starks?
<s> That wasn't a fucking restraint.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
<s> And what does that mean?
<s> I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
<s> No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
<s> You may have known my father, William Starks.
<s> No, it hasn't.
<s> What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
<s> Mom, he just fixed our car.
<s> Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
<s> Yeah, but I don't know what.
<s> [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
<s> No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
<s> I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
<s> It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
<s> Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
<s> There're no cars on this street.
<s> I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
<s> It's Sunday.
<s> Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
<s> To the hospital.
<s> Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
<s> Good. How's your mom?
<s> I'm doing fine.
<s> It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
<s> I still don't either, even after all these years.
<s> You're not crazy.
<s> You thought my father was crazy?
<s> How do you know about Dr. Becker?
<s> Why would we do that?
<s> Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
<s> Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
<s> Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
<s> You still don't believe me, do you?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Don't you go to jail for that?
<s> Is it true?
<s> [Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
<s> I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
<s> I'll manage.
<s> No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
<s> Sure.
<s> [Beat] I do it.
<s> Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
<s> I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
<s> What?
<s> Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
<s> I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
<s> Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
<s> She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
<s> J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
<s> Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
<s> I'm a robber.
<s> You're a little angle, you are.
<s> Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
<s> Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
<s> Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
<s> Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
<s> Maybe.
<s> Why now, Jimmy?
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay.  I will, too.
<s> I don't know how to fish, Louise.
<s> In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
<s> We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
<s> Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
<s> Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
<s> Yeah!
<s> Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
<s> Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
<s> Just what is that supposed to mean?
<s> I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
<s> Give me the keys.
<s> No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
<s> Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
<s> Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
<s> She thinks he's a pig.
<s> Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
<s> Lemme see the map.
<s> Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
<s> They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
<s> Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
<s> Why not?!
<s> Let's get it over with.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know those little dogs you see people with?
<s> Just ignore him.
<s> I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
<s> About how fast was I going?
<s> Yeah, you want it?
<s> You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
<s> Good.
<s> And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
<s> Yup.
<s> Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
<s> I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
<s> No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
<s> How do you stay so positive?
<s> What?!
<s> It's grand!
<s> You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
<s> Hi there!  You alright?
<s> Fresno.
<s> What?
<s> Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
<s> Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
<s> Never?
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
<s> I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
<s> Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
<s> No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
<s> No.
<s> You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
<s> But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
<s> Who?
<s> From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
<s> Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
<s> No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
<s> Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
<s> You found my car?!
<s> I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
<s> A girl after your own heart, Ted.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No thanks.
<s> You own a home there?
<s> Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
<s> -- He's in a cage?!
<s> We will, but first I have a surprise.
<s> When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
<s> Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
<s> Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
<s> Warren!
<s> No, not at all.
<s> I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
<s> So she's married?
<s> Oh, uh, I resigned.
<s> Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
<s> Surprised?
<s> You're a sick man, you know that?
<s> Did you study under Kim Greene?
<s> Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
<s> Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
<s> Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
<s> The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
<s> Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
<s> Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
<s> I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
<s> But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
<s> Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
<s> You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
<s> This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
<s> Where's Puffy?
<s> Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
<s> No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
<s> That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
<s> Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
<s> Oh Jesus...
<s> A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
<s> I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
<s> You betcha!
<s> He's dead.
<s> Hm?
<s> Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
<s> Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
<s> Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
<s> Then what the fuck did you do it for?
<s> Mary, come on...
<s> You're Woogie?
<s> I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
<s> I wish.
<s> Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
<s> No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
<s> See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
<s> Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
<s> Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
<s> Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
<s> Huh...?
<s> We've got bigger problems right now.
<s> McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
<s> ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
<s> He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
<s> Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
<s> Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
<s> You can't take him out this late in the game.
<s> Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
<s> Says what, Kenny?
<s> This is from the Highest Authority?
<s> Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
<s> Dean Rusk!
<s> I'm gonna protect those pilots.
<s> Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
<s> Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
<s> I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
<s> And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
<s> Jesus Christ...
<s> You're my hero, Carl.
<s> Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
<s> Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
<s> Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
<s> FBI? What you investigatin'?
<s> Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
<s> It ain't Geronimo.
<s> Good. Thank you.
<s> You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
<s> Who the fuck is he?
<s> Beats the hell outta me.
<s> Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
<s> She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
<s> -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
<s> I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
<s> Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
<s> The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
<s> Why?
<s> Let the press through.
<s> After we've completed our investigation.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Medicine. As in medicine man?
<s> And...
<s> I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
<s> -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
<s> I don't see the connection.
<s> You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
<s> Likewise.
<s> Cuz you're a cop.
<s> They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
<s> At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
<s> We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
<s> He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
<s> You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
<s> I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
<s> Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
<s> Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
<s> I read, Cooch.
<s> Mister Tully.
<s> Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
<s> I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
<s> Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
<s> Well, it is. It is that, too.
<s> Yeow!
<s> What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
<s> That's all!
<s> Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
<s> Two miles.
<s> Too aggressive?
<s> I'm special.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
<s> How about anything, anything you want to do.
<s> A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
<s> I'm starting to sense that now.
<s> Make what?
<s> It's not suffering anymore.
<s> Winston Churchill.
<s> In that order?
<s> What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
<s> What?
<s> He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
<s> Maybe I shouldn't take it.
<s> What?
<s> It does.
<s> It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
<s> That's three.
<s> I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
<s> How could you?
<s> ...Something like that.
<s> Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
<s> You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
<s> BREAKING LEFT!
<s> Roger, I've got it.
<s> Rudder's left, stick's forward.
<s> Okay.
<s> What do I want?
<s> You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
<s> On what?
<s> Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
<s> So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
<s> Could use a dash more jet fuel.
<s> Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
<s> Come on, relax...
<s> I'm gonna take him, Goose.
<s> Wood's okay. I want Viper.
<s> Time to go.
<s> No shit! That why they call him Ice?
<s> Don't.
<s> Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
<s> That's because you don't have any women.
<s> STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
<s> STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
<s> GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
<s> I think I can work it out on my own.
<s> Tell me one thing.
<s> Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
<s> NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
<s> So have I.
<s> Three guesses.
<s> How's it goin', Coog?
<s> Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
<s> My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
<s> No bother.
<s> My wife's house.
<s> Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
<s> They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
<s> Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
<s> I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
<s> Looks like another schizoid embolism.
<s> Why not?
<s> Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
<s> Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
<s> Sleazy...and demure.
<s> I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
<s> Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
<s> Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
<s> She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
<s> Where?
<s> This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
<s> Relax, you'll live longer.
<s> Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
<s> You went to Rekall, remember?
<s> Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
<s> I've got Quaid.
<s> I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
<s> Come on!
<s> But I'm always home by morning.
<s> Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
<s> You know I do.
<s> All right, forget about it.
<s> I'm late.
<s> Bye.
<s> Oh God, Doug.
<s> Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
<s> That a problem?
<s> I guess he didn't.
<s> There's something I have to tell you...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Not any more.
<s> You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
<s> Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
<s> If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
<s> Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
<s> I saw them.
<s> You two-faced-bastard.
<s> I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
<s> The one in the mine!
<s> What?
<s> Ready as we'll ever be.
<s> That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
<s> Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
<s> I think I scared it!
<s> Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
<s> What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
<s> I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
<s> Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
<s> I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
<s> Hell you did.  Your turn.
<s> What the hell do we know about seismographs?
<s> Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
<s> Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
<s> Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
<s> Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
<s> Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
<s> Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
<s> Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
<s> Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
<s> No ties.
<s> They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
<s> Yeah, Heather, we got you.
<s> We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
<s> Could be.
<s> I didn't do it!  What's going on?
<s> Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
<s> Please... I need to sleep...
<s> He was your snitch.
<s> And one good guy.
<s> Correct.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Sustained.
<s> -- With objection!
<s> I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
<s> What about entrapment?
<s> I can describe it.
<s> We had a description of the suspect.
<s> Right. You're right.
<s> I specialize, Roger...
<s> I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
<s> Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
<s> What, the lunatic who --
<s> Saving it for the Sunday Times.
<s> That's why I hate experts.
<s> That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
<s> I'm not that desperate.
<s> You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
<s> "Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
<s> Screw you too, Kitty.
<s> I don't know. The truth, maybe.
<s> About Chinatown. What went down.
<s> How can I tell you what I don't know!
<s> For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
<s> See-cil.
<s> I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
<s> Don Reynard.
<s> Argumentative.
<s> Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
<s> The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
<s> I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
<s> I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
<s> -- What trial?
<s> -- Roger --
<s> Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
<s> And you b-believe that.
<s> I want you to kill for me.
<s> It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
<s> Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
<s> Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
<s> Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
<s> That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
<s> Thank you, Carl.
<s> I am going over here.
<s> A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
<s> Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
<s> That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
<s> That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
<s> Oh.
<s> You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
<s> Smell something fishy, huh?
<s> Stanley, I heard all about it.
<s> Someone else has it now.
<s> The later events have never been kept a secret.
<s> You are here and there is no place to go...
<s> Where's Hap?
<s> Ever see her with someone else?
<s> Did she ever mention any friends?
<s> How come Jack let's you work here?
<s> Say no more.
<s> Do you take cocaine, Irene?
<s> I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
<s> Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
<s> He talks loud. And he loves his code.
<s> That's what I heard.
<s> Oh.
<s> It's late, Sam.
<s> In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
<s> I'll get my kit.
<s> She's wearing a ring.
<s> I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
<s> You didn't do your homework?
<s> I don't know what to do.
<s> I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
<s> Donna, are you my best friend?
<s> Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
<s> YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
<s> Not you, Donna, not you.
<s> What can I tell you?
<s> No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
<s> Fill 'er up.
<s> Brother, I hear you talkin'.
<s> Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
<s> But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
<s> Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
<s> Not now.
<s> "Oh, Laura..."
<s> You mean the ones you pity.
<s> Eating?
<s> Fish eyes?
<s> What?
<s> I'm sorry, Mom.
<s> Sure you do, it's good for you.
<s> Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
<s> Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
<s> No.
<s> They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
<s> How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
<s> Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
<s> Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
<s> Who am I?
<s> That's right.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Very good.
<s> Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
<s> No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
<s> Yes.
<s> Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
<s> Gruber...
<s> It's a crime.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Through, through his book.
<s> 'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
<s> ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
<s> ...I was one of a group of...
<s> Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
<s> Tell me one?
<s> You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
<s> What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
<s> I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
<s> In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
<s> Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
<s> ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
<s> Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
<s> 'Code Blue'...
<s> She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
<s> You're going to settle out of court?
<s> Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
<s> I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
<s> Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
<s> ...that's perfectly all right.
<s> You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
<s> Yes...
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> This is a complicated case, your Honor...
<s> Overruled...
<s> I changed my room at the Hotel.
<s> And what are you? A cop?
<s> I think I will.
<s> Do you want me to go...?
<s> I've got to work.
<s> And what makes you so tough?
<s> I don't have a goddamned idea.
<s> ...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
<s> My subscription lapsed three years ago...
<s> No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
<s> I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
<s> I've got nothing to say to you.
<s> And ask me what?
<s> ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
<s> I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
<s> Admittance form is wrong.
<s> Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
<s> Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
<s> So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
<s> I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
<s> I can't talk now.
<s> D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> The 'History'...?
<s> Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
<s> Yes.
<s> Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
<s> Huh. And why is that?
<s> How'm I doing so far?
<s> Huh.
<s> That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
<s> Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
<s> Come on out!  We're friends!
<s> I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
<s> There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
<s> Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
<s> Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
<s> Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
<s> Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
<s> I didn't know how to stop you...!
<s> Can you handle one of these?
<s> It's gone now.
<s> I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
<s> I liked him.
<s> Hours.  I've been so scared...!
<s> I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
<s> It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
<s> If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
<s> I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
<s> We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
<s> He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
<s> He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
<s> I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
<s> Maybe you should tell me your dream.
<s> No...
<s> He was just here!
<s> Everything is not fine!
<s> Right 'cross the freeway.
<s> Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
<s> John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
<s> John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
<s> Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
<s> Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
<s> Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
<s> Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
<s> Guilty.
<s> Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
<s> Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> No, I can't.
<s> Yeah.
<s> To take a piss.
<s> Believe what?
<s> I just can't believe it.
<s> I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
<s> Me either.
<s> That's not why he's sending me.
<s> Nobody says you have to be like me.
<s> Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
<s> I know enough.
<s> Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> I can't watch this.
<s> Forget it.
<s> I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
<s> Come on man, what'd they look like?
<s> How do you know?  They might.
<s> Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
<s> All stop on the engine.
<s> It was my fault.  I slipped.
<s> Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
<s> It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
<s> No.
<s> Why are you here?
<s> It has nothing to do with him.
<s> You're officer of the watch, George.
<s> They'll know about it in the morning.
<s> That's enough.
<s> I can show you how to use a slide rule.
<s> What is it... the secret?
<s> If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
<s> It seems we're short on singers.
<s> Son of a bitch!!
<s> No.
<s> I'm sorry...
<s> You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
<s> Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
<s> The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
<s> I am accountable.
<s> Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
<s> I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
<s> How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
<s> Yessir.
<s> You black?
<s> Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
<s> Have now.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
<s> Set one up.
<s> Sounds right... I'll check it out.
<s> Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
<s> Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
<s> Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
<s> In many capacities.
<s> I couldn't say, which one?
<s> This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
<s> How's that?
<s> The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
<s> Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
<s> I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
<s> Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
<s> Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
<s> Peanut...
<s> Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
<s> How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
<s> And you never told nobody about it?
<s> I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
<s> That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
<s> Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You tell the boy who knocked you up?
<s> Hell, peanut...
<s> So?
<s> There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
<s> Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
<s> You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
<s> Got anyplace special in mind?
<s> Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
<s> Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
<s> Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
<s> Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
<s> He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
<s> Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
<s> It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
<s> My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
<s> I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
<s> I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
<s> Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
<s> The only one.
<s> Yeah?
<s> That smell's still fillin' this room good.
<s> That was in Vietnam.
<s> What?
<s> It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
<s> HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
<s> Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
<s> Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
<s> Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
<s> I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
<s> What if I asked you not to?
<s> What if I told you not to?
<s> I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
<s> Santos... It isn't.
<s> What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
<s> I want you to get rid of Sailor.
<s> Shoot him.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
<s> You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
<s> There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
<s> No.
<s> So?
<s> It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
<s> Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
<s> I didn't see nothin'...
<s> Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
<s> Your wife.
<s> Isn't she?
<s> I know. He started it Fall semester.
<s> I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
<s> He heard everything we were saying.
<s> Shit.
<s> What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
<s> It's a little late to call Admissions.
<s> Only in your bones?
<s> I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
<s> Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
<s> The Chancellor's here? Now?
<s> Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
<s> First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
<s> He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
<s> 'That's my car, motherfucker.'
<s> Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
<s> Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
<s> It's mine.
<s> How long have you been having them?
<s> I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
<s> Her dog, yes.
<s> Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
<s> Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
<s> You're in Kinship?
<s> ...You carry firearms.
<s> It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
<s> I'll miss my bus.
<s> I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
<s> Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
<s> Yea, James.
<s> Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
<s> No thanks. I'm fine without them.
<s> No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
<s> Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
<s> So where have you been staying?
<s> Yeah, well, actually...
<s> Jesus, James. Wow.
<s> Where's that?
<s> James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
<s> Amazing.
<s> Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
<s> It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
<s> James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
<s> Because of my coat?
<s> The hell I am.
<s> I never said that.
<s> Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
<s> Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
<s> James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
<s> That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
<s> Ah, wear whatever you want.
<s> I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
<s> Oh. Well. I...
<s> Grady!
<s> At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
<s> Who does?
<s> I told you, Sewickly Heights.
<s> Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
<s> I got the message you called too.
<s> If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
<s> No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
<s> I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
<s> Don't. I know what you're going to say.
<s> No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
<s> Caps.
<s> Really? That was fast.
<s> Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
<s> I know that. I know what's at stake here...
<s> James Leer.
<s> I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
<s> It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
<s> I think I might've said I was in love with you.
<s> I said it didn't sound like you.
<s> Oh?
<s> Tony. Now that I'm home.
<s> It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
<s> It's Grady, Walter.
<s> I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
<s> I... I...
<s> I don't know. It might be...
<s> Give me a break, Grady.
<s> A jockey? You mean, like --
<s> I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
<s> That's weird.
<s> Just a few then. The big ones.
<s> Beautiful. How's business?
<s> Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
<s> It was a beautiful present.
<s> Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
<s> The birthday party.
<s> Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
<s> Ask me. Ask me anything.
<s> It's hard to describe.
<s> Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
<s> It's good to listen to your daddy.
<s> Robin.
<s> What?
<s> I fell asleep.
<s> I went to bed around seven.
<s> I have a passionate girlfriend.
<s> Yes.
<s> It gives me headaches.
<s> What?
<s> Lovers' quarrel?
<s> If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
<s> It sounds like you were banished.
<s> They sound like finches.
<s> Ms. Kramer.
<s> Robin, listen to me.
<s> I don't mind.
<s> Bad idea.
<s> Reflect.
<s> It's okay.
<s> I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
<s> I'm not that crazy.
<s> Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
<s> We have a few more minutes.
<s> I couldn't say.
<s> Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
<s> I know --
<s> I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
<s> I want to talk about it now.
<s> Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
<s> In my bed too.
<s> We're little kids.
<s> Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
<s> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I was six years old!
<s> Accept you?
<s> Time.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
<s> Most women wouldn't choose it.
<s> Neither do you.
<s> What do you think?
<s> I'll buy a plant.
<s> You're still here.
<s> Maybe later.
<s> The worst?
<s> I molested little girls.
<s> Yeah.
<s> How many girls did you molest?
<s> What?
<s> Walter.
<s> No. Never again.
<s> You don't really --
<s> Why young girls, Walter?
<s> No. That's what I used to tell myself.
<s> Nothing. It's over.
<s> I'm not scared.
<s> Live together.
<s> Just think about it.
<s> Do what?
<s> Yeah.
<s> How deep's the drop-off here?
<s> Hey, you okay?
<s> I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
<s> Yeah, okay.  Okay.
<s> Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
<s> Wasn't up to me.
<s> Your rig?
<s> No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
<s> How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
<s> Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
<s> Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
<s> NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
<s> Tell me later.
<s> Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
<s> God, I hate that bitch.
<s> Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
<s> Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
<s> You watch yourself.
<s> Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
<s> Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
<s> I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
<s> Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
<s> Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
<s> I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
<s> He's hallucinating badly.
<s> She'll wait.
<s> What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
<s> What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
<s> Wait for what?
<s> What! After giving us such a run around...
<s> No, Dad, it isn't.
<s> Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
<s> And why do you tell us this only now?
<s> And how do you explain that?
<s> I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
<s> Yes, very much so.
<s> I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
<s> It takes even less.
<s> Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
<s> Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
<s> And why did you drop them?
<s> And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
<s> Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
<s> Late, very late.
<s> To do what?
<s> But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
<s> It was futile. We went all over.
<s> You say that just to flatter me.
<s> You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
<s> You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
<s> Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
<s> He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
<s> But why?... What if it starts to rain?
<s> Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
<s> I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
<s> So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
<s> Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
<s> And do you remember where she got off?
<s> There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
<s> No. The owners are in Australia.
<s> Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
<s> Yes. Until proven otherwise.
<s> Is that far from here?
<s> Through someone else?
<s> Why?
<s> Who?
<s> Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
<s> Agnes...
<s> Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
<s> Why?
<s> Yes Mother.
<s> No.
<s> It's not that... it's not that...
<s> It's not my time of month.
<s> I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
<s> I don't know... I don't know...
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, there are so many.
<s> Oh, I know he does.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> After God... before the waste-paper basket.
<s> Yes I do,  but I want you to...
<s> Martha Louise Livingston.
<s> I can't have them any more.
<s> I've stopped menstruating
<s> No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
<s> I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
<s> No, but I can never tell her that.
<s> Yes.
<s> A mistake... it was a mistake...
<s> Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
<s> I'm always bad.
<s> She...
<s> Yes.
<s> Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
<s> To help me.
<s> But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
<s> It came out of me.
<s> Because I was afraid.
<s> Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
<s> We went to chapel for vespers.
<s> I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
<s> Sister Marguerite I think.
<s> Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
<s> Are you ill?
<s> I don't know which one 
<s> Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
<s> Go away, I don't want you here.
<s> Yes.
<s> And the passage to the barn?
<s> Who?
<s> How did she know about him?
<s> Agnes, who did this to you?
<s> Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
<s> And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
<s> What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
<s> What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
<s> You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
<s> Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
<s> How do you survive?
<s> Who told you this?
<s> Yes... I...
<s> Two packs a day.
<s> She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
<s> We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
<s> I haven't a clue.
<s> I am not with the Inquisition.
<s> What's your opinion?
<s> From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
<s> If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
<s> That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
<s> It's possible isn't it?
<s> One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
<s> And what happened?
<s> It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
<s> I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
<s> ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
<s> And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
<s> Then help her.
<s> Aquittal.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'd like yours too.
<s> I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
<s> Hand rolled.
<s> There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
<s> Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
<s> My God, you're as crazy as...
<s> This is insane.
<s> You're saying God did it?
<s> That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
<s> Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
<s> Why would I lie?
<s> I'm concerned about her health.
<s> Where is she?
<s> Why do you insist upon pressing...
<s> That's a lie.
<s> Agnes, what happened to the baby?
<s> Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
<s> Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
<s> Just you?
<s> Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
<s> Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
<s> I'll murder that Lennon.
<s> They'll be here.
<s> Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
<s> Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
<s> Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
<s> I've made the scene.
<s> You do - repeatedly.
<s> I don't care.
<s> She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
<s> Wake up!
<s> We do.
<s> Is he?
<s> What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
<s> It's Paul's grandfather.
<s> Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
<s> Eh, there's only three of them.
<s> Oh, sorry I spoke.
<s> How'd you guess?
<s> The big hammer?
<s> Why selfish?
<s> Out where?
<s> Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
<s> What?
<s> Lip reading.
<s> Is there a fire, then?
<s> Eh?
<s> You see, sly villains.
<s> Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
<s> It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
<s> Don't dramatise.
<s> Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
<s> Oh yes, he's clean all right.
<s> Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
<s> He's got you worried, then?
<s> Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
<s> Aye, before anyone stops us.
<s> Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
<s> Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
<s> That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
<s> Please, can I have one to surge with?
<s> Come on speedy!
<s> Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
<s> I'm not, no.
<s> Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
<s> Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
<s> He'll get over it.
<s> Y'what?
<s> Aren't we ...
<s> It's not my fault.
<s> Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
<s> But John hasn't got any.
<s> Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
<s> And they want me?
<s> I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
<s> I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
<s> Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
<s> Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
<s> Where the hell are we?
<s> Yeah.  Two hours.
<s> Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
<s> There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
<s> I'll see what I can do.
<s> What's the terrain down there?
<s> No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
<s> Wretched.  What happened to me?
<s> Play it for us, please.
<s> It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
<s> What?
<s> It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
<s> The water will still recycle.
<s> Here, let me try.
<s> No, I don't want us separated.
<s> Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
<s> How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
<s> The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
<s> Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
<s> The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
<s> At least it can't get up here now.
<s> That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
<s> It's time for drastic remedies.
<s> Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
<s> We're not going anywhere.
<s> I think it's fizzled out.
<s> Hey!  what about the film?
<s> In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
<s> You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
<s> We can use the flamethrower.
<s> Thanks for the thought. 
<s> Who knows?
<s> It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
<s> Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
<s> They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
<s> Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
<s> Room by room, corridor by corridor.
<s> Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
<s> Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
<s> Right.  Fire up all systems.
<s> Sandy, contact traffic control.
<s> No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
<s> Engine room, what happened?
<s> Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
<s> It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
<s> He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
<s> Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
<s> We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
<s> All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
<s> I guess we open the door and net it.
<s> What do you think?  Now we go in.
<s> Can we get to him?
<s> At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
<s> That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
<s> Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
<s> Here, carry these.
<s> The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
<s> It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
<s> Do you wanna head back and call it in?
<s> Yep...
<s> We're not gonna make it, are we?
<s> Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
<s> Keep trying!
<s> We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
<s> Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
<s> We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
<s> Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
<s> I dunno.
<s> Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
<s> I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
<s> Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
<s> How?
<s> Couple more seconds!
<s> Where does that lead to?
<s> What's the problem?
<s> Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
<s> Compensate!
<s> How many... how many people are missing?
<s> Looks like it.
<s> Is that a fact.
<s> Only six?
<s> Check out the tent.
<s> Agreed.
<s> Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
<s> What can I do?
<s> No!
<s> Please do.
<s> I believe I will.
<s> Just some coffee.
<s> It wasn't meant to be.
<s> I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
<s> Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
<s> You have no right to say such things!
<s> We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
<s> Yes, Addison.
<s> Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
<s> It's the same thing, isn't it?
<s> Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
<s> That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
<s> We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
<s> Margo.
<s> Eve! My understudy...
<s> Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
<s> How nice.
<s> Show me a human and I might have!
<s> Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
<s> Huh?
<s> As of this moment you're six years old...
<s> When - when are you coming back?
<s> To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
<s> You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
<s> - guilty.
<s> So full of meaning, fire and music!
<s> Don't calm down.
<s> Here we go...
<s> Margo, let's make peace.
<s> Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
<s> He does not exaggerate. I was good.
<s> The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
<s> What would you like? Texas?
<s> You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
<s> Of course not.
<s> From what would I be running?
<s> I'm for it.
<s> Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
<s> No thanks, Birdie.
<s> Something maybe grew a size bigger.
<s> Night an' day.
<s> Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
<s> Don't be dense. The party.
<s> Miss Harrington...
<s> I - I guess I fell asleep.
<s> What report? To whom?
<s> I don't care if I never get home.
<s> Why should you think I wouldn't be?
<s> You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
<s> Eve. Eve Harrington.
<s> My husband...
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Karen.
<s> Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
<s> If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
<s> Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
<s> Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
<s> They certainly don't waste much time.
<s> I don't intend to be.
<s> If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
<s> It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
<s> Over my dead body...
<s> Not at all...
<s> Well - if I'm not in the way...
<s> When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
<s> Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
<s> It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
<s> Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
<s> Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
<s> Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
<s> Why not?
<s> What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
<s> They're your fans, your audience-
<s> The heave-ho.
<s> Roughly ten minutes.
<s> Three or four miles...
<s> We've all seemed a little tense lately...
<s> Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
<s> Isn't that what they always say?
<s> Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
<s> Loud.
<s> And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
<s> Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
<s> When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
<s> I wonder why.
<s> Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
<s> Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
<s> The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
<s> Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
<s> Margo!
<s> Not much.
<s> ... Among so many quiet qualities.
<s> Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
<s> Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
<s> I will.
<s> Twentyish. It isn't important.
<s> I have no intention of having an accident!
<s> I mean really, deeply angry...
<s> Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
<s> What's your being married got to do with it?
<s> But that was the fourth straight time.
<s> Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
<s> I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
<s> The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
<s> Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
<s> Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
<s> --I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
<s> --it was bullshit the way it was--
<s> --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
<s> About the past year.
<s> --fifteen phone calls--
<s> --you do?--with access to records?
<s> It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
<s> Facts or theory?
<s> I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
<s> And I'm a Republican.
<s> When?
<s> That happens to people.  OK, go on.
<s> You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
<s> How high up, which Republicans?
<s> --'cause I only know four chords--
<s> What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
<s> It's nothing personal, though. 
<s> Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
<s> --Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
<s> Hmm?
<s> John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
<s> --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
<s> --yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
<s> --Howard Hunt?
<s> They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
<s> --there's nothing new in it--
<s> Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
<s> You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
<s> Give me your checkbook then.
<s> This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
<s> Just let me get a match.
<s> ...No... never in so many words...
<s> To cover up?
<s> I will not talk about the other two.
<s> Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
<s> We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
<s> Go on.
<s> How senior?
<s> --he went to her apartment and he told her--
<s> Electronic surveillance.
<s> So?
<s> You're a lawyer and you're here--
<s> Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
<s> I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
<s> I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
<s> I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
<s> Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
<s> Haldeman too?
<s> --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
<s> Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
<s> I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
<s> Security consultant.
<s> --I'm Woodward.
<s> No.
<s> --well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
<s> Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
<s> That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
<s> I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
<s> One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
<s> According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
<s> Absolutely.
<s> --can we use their names?--
<s> --well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
<s> Of course--everything they asked--
<s> I'm not good in math.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
<s> So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
<s> Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
<s> Forget it.
<s> Neither will I.
<s> No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
<s> I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
<s> Yeah right.
<s> Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
<s> No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
<s> Did you guys hook up or something?
<s> Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
<s> Yeah, that's right.
<s> No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
<s> So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
<s> Right.  That gives us...
<s> Holy shit!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Dad, come in.
<s> That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
<s> I told you.
<s> Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
<s> Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
<s> Don't you want me to?
<s> Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
<s> Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
<s> Move with the music.
<s> Oh no.
<s> Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
<s> I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
<s> You think so?
<s> How?
<s> It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
<s> Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
<s> Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
<s> So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
<s> Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
<s> Yeah, are you?
<s> Yeah, right here.
<s> Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
<s> Does it tell me how to get laid?
<s> Qualify for what?
<s> I'm such a loser.
<s> This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
<s> Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
<s> This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No way.
<s> No it isn't! You're dead!
<s> Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
<s> Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
<s> In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
<s> Serafine...?
<s> It's okay. I can see fine.
<s> I know. He told me.
<s> I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
<s> I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
<s> Yeah. French fries...
<s> It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
<s> That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
<s> What...?
<s> Where?
<s> Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
<s> FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
<s> Or else what? You'll kill me?
<s> Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
<s> If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
<s> Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
<s> Looks like he lied to you too.
<s> Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
<s> Sort of...
<s> Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
<s> The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
<s> No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
<s> Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
<s> But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I was showing Sonya something . . .
<s> I know, but I had to because . . .
<s> It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
<s> I'm not sure but look. . .
<s> She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I shant!
<s> It's okay. Didn't hurt..
<s> Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
<s> Anya... where are we?
<s> THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
<s> You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
<s> Bartok... a question.
<s> She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
<s> "Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
<s> Ah! Let us begin!
<s> But it's not	the money, Vlad.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Run, Anya -  go...
<s> Promise me she'll have her home.
<s> And tell me that she's happy.
<s> Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
<s> Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
<s> Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Alvy.
<s> Tsch.
<s> I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
<s> No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
<s> I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
<s> How can you possibly oversleep?
<s> What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
<s> M'm.
<s> Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
<s> All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
<s> I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
<s> Me? Oh, downtown!
<s> Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
<s> Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
<s> Don't be funny.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well...
<s> Okay.
<s> Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
<s> Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
<s> Fifteen years, yeah.
<s> No, so help me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
<s> Good? I was-
<s> H'm?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
<s> That place is four hundred dollars a month?
<s> It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
<s> Hey, don't be ridiculous.
<s> It relaxes me.
<s> Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
<s> M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
<s> I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
<s> Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
<s> I didn't follow you!
<s> Following is different. I was spying.
<s> Who cares? Who cares?
<s> Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
<s> G-go on, I'm interested.
<s> M'hm.
<s> Will it change your wife?
<s> You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
<s> A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
<s> And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
<s> It was just great!
<s> Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
<s> Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
<s> That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
<s> Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
<s> Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
<s> And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
<s> I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
<s> Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
<s> Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
<s> Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
<s> Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
<s> Thanks, honey.
<s> Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
<s> You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
<s> Oh, Alvy, come on.
<s> That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
<s> Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
<s> You should be ashamed of yourself.
<s> Why are you so hostile?
<s> My head is throbbing.
<s> Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
<s> The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
<s> Oh, do yuh?
<s> Whatta you mean?
<s> May I see your license, please?
<s> Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
<s> Right, Max. California, Max.
<s> What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
<s> Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
<s> Look, uh...
<s> I don't know, I mean, I-
<s> Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
<s> We're gonna operate together.
<s> His wife has diabetes!
<s> She was stealing.
<s> Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
<s> Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
<s> Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
<s> Hey-
<s> I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
<s> Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
<s> A long time.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> Why didn't you come in?
<s> Would it make a difference?
<s> You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
<s> You're fucking desperate.
<s> What?
<s> I'm in mourning.
<s> How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
<s> This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
<s> To dander.  Otis.
<s> Didn't I say?
<s> You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
<s> Don't you miss it?
<s> Really.
<s> Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
<s> Sally?
<s> I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
<s> You really need to be fucked.
<s> Lucy overdosed.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
<s> Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
<s> Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Probably not.
<s> Fantastic.  Out here.
<s> I love you, you're a genius.
<s> We've only been over this how many times?
<s> Did you invite them?
<s> Ryan's novel.
<s> No.  I missed that.
<s> We're great.
<s> Really?
<s> Who'd like to go and find Otis?
<s> Dinner.  Don't be angry.
<s> Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
<s> He'll find his way back.
<s> Otis!!!!
<s> Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
<s> DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
<s> Hello?  Last birthday was?
<s> Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
<s> I have no idea who you are.
<s> Me too.
<s> Ah...
<s> She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
<s> Sure.
<s> Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
<s> Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
<s> But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
<s> You're an interior decorator, right?
<s> Oh.
<s> No you're not.
<s> Elitism?
<s> And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
<s> We're way past inappropriate.
<s> You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
<s> And he doesn't smoke?
<s> Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
<s> You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
<s> You're not serious.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Yes.
<s> No, never.
<s> No, no thanks.
<s> Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Are you asking me to marry you?
<s> Very.
<s> Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
<s> No, really, five thousand with your discount.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
<s> At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
<s> The both of you.
<s> Oh Soph...
<s> And the food sucks, I know.
<s> Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
<s> Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
<s> Neither does Joe.
<s> Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
<s> No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
<s> Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
<s> You -- you think I'm right?
<s> Yes.
<s> Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
<s> SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
<s> Well I guess that makes us even.
<s> Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
<s> <u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
<s> Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
<s> Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
<s> Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
<s> Well...no, but --
<s> Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
<s> I'm the Princess, aren't I?
<s> You did?
<s> I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
<s> Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
<s> Oh, no, sir!
<s> Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
<s> Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
<s> I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
<s> Why are we so successful?
<s> Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
<s> Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
<s> My mother.
<s> Yeah.  How much?
<s> Under the mat? 
<s> Something the matter?
<s> Well, I have some paper towels --
<s> Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
<s> Why?
<s> That's me. 
<s> Really?
<s> Good night.
<s> Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
<s> Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
<s> How is your cold?
<s> Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
<s> Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
<s> Why?
<s> Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
<s> They had to pump it out.
<s> He doesn't give a damn about me.
<s> He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
<s> You don't have to entertain me.
<s> Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
<s> Pick a card.
<s> A bad insurance risk?
<s> Gin.
<s> I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
<s> As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
<s> Pick up your cards and let's go.
<s> You bet. I got a terrific hand.
<s> Sure.
<s> For me?
<s> Are you supposed to?
<s> It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
<s> It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
<s> You did?
<s> Over a girl?
<s> So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
<s> Oh.
<s> Fine. How's your eye?
<s> You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
<s> Good night, Miss Kubelik.
<s> Seven --  -- queen.
<s> No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
<s> That's very flattering.
<s> Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
<s> Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
<s> Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
<s> You too, sir.
<s> I know how it is.
<s> Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
<s> Now what was your news, Baxter?
<s> Mine?
<s> You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
<s> Now I'll have to borrow your key.
<s> How's that again?
<s> So what's it going to be?
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
<s> Yes?
<s> What does he mean, accident?
<s> I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
<s> Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
<s> So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
<s> Now will you get out?
<s> I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
<s> I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
<s> And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
<s> Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
<s> Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
<s> My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
<s> Let me get my bag.
<s> I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
<s> Something like that.
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
<s> Well, I have things to do --
<s> Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
<s> Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
<s> Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
<s> Six weeks. But who's counting?
<s> -- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
<s> Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
<s> We didn't talk about it -- you did.
<s> Handle what?
<s> Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
<s> You know I do.
<s> Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
<s> He wouldn't.
<s> I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
<s> See if they'll what?
<s> What's it matter? Get to the point.
<s> Well --
<s> We need all our fuel.
<s> Esprit de corps --
<s> One for all -- all for one --
<s> None.
<s> No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
<s> You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
<s> We do.
<s> I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
<s> Who are you ?
<s> Yes, sir --
<s> Call me what, sir?
<s> That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
<s> God knows.
<s> Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
<s> We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
<s> I'll go with him --
<s> All right I got a little surprise for you --
<s> We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
<s> Who knows what's up there?
<s> When'd you do it?
<s> Signs?
<s> Anyone got a cigarette.
<s> Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
<s> Terminate with extreme prejudice.
<s> Charlie?
<s> They must have seen the fire.
<s> About what ?
<s> But why ?
<s> A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
<s> Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
<s> Your daughter.
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
<s> It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
<s> Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
<s> I got bored in Saigon.
<s> I met him.
<s> The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
<s> You know you're right.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I like it...
<s> How's the pain?
<s> What Truth?
<s> Fuck no.
<s> We'll exterminate the fuckers !
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Yes, I know...
<s> He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
<s> Nah.
<s> Sure.
<s> No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
<s> No -- leave it --
<s> Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
<s> I should be checking on the boat.
<s> You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
<s> Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
<s> You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
<s> Needs patching.
<s> Wait 'til I'm across!
<s> 94   CONTINUED:  
<s> I just want this over with.
<s> 157  CONTINUED:
<s> Back against the bars.  Now.
<s> Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
<s> Somewhere along the pipeline.
<s> Why?
<s> Be careful -- there're two of them.
<s> Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
<s> My home is here.  With you.
<s> No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
<s> New to the country, kid?
<s> Yeah.  Maybe so.
<s> -- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
<s> I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
<s> Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
<s> You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
<s> That's right.  You're not.
<s> We've got another two hours of daylight.
<s> Too bad we're heading west.
<s> You don't feel cold?
<s> Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
<s> You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
<s> You broke the radio, remember?
<s> Shut up!
<s> You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
<s> Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
<s> -- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
<s> Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
<s> Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
<s> Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
<s> I'm right fuckin' here with you.
<s> Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
<s> That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
<s> Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
<s> Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
<s> Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
<s> Stay out of this...  Doctor?
<s> He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
<s> Since forever.
<s> Yes.
<s> I've got Jews at my table.
<s> You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
<s> Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
<s> How old are you?
<s> Otherwise, you're not ugly.
<s> What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
<s> No!!! Stay away from me!
<s> I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
<s> Can we order first?
<s> Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
<s> I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
<s> It was a mistake.
<s> To hell with sex.
<s> Yeah... Well...
<s> I can trust my brain.
<s> See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
<s> Were you asleep?
<s> 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
<s> ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
<s> No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
<s> No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
<s> Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
<s> I just love her.  How're you doing?
<s> No. No. Get Carol.
<s> Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
<s> Two years ago...
<s> No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
<s> You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
<s> It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
<s> "What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
<s> Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
<s> Think white and get serious.
<s> I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
<s> You little stinker. He's given you everything.
<s> Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
<s> Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
<s> 'Love was... '
<s> Do you realize that I work at him?
<s> That cleaning woman doesn't...
<s> Thanks.
<s> But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
<s> This stuff is pointless.
<s> I'm going back with you.
<s> Another place where?
<s> I'm coming.
<s> Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
<s> Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
<s> I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
<s> The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
<s> Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
<s> Where?
<s> So you're from around here?
<s> Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
<s> Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
<s> The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
<s> What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
<s> After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
<s> What?  What's okay?
<s> There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
<s> It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
<s> Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
<s> I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
<s> Sure.
<s> Sick.  The flu.
<s> I know.  It was a joke.
<s> I bet you fucking know!
<s> One hour per man.
<s> What?  How did you know I had a cat?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ten million --
<s> 'Them'?
<s> No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
<s> We don't have a choice.
<s> If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
<s> No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
<s> Why?
<s> It's not the same, is it?
<s> How did you get into the business?
<s> The C.I.A.?
<s> You were like a boy genius?
<s> Why not?
<s> You went from high school to the Agency?
<s> They didn't give you a choice, did they?
<s> Why not?
<s> Because I want to know.
<s> That's fiction.
<s> Nothing.
<s> What?
<s> Oh.  What do you think about?
<s> I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Okay.  Then what?
<s> Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
<s> Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
<s> You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
<s> I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
<s> How do you know they're not?
<s> Jesus, if someone had --
<s> No.
<s> Did he explain how this happened?
<s> Are you attracted to me?
<s> I didn't want to complicate the situation.
<s> Yes.
<s> Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
<s> Honestly?
<s> I'm not normal.
<s> Shit.
<s> Right.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, God.  I see it!
<s> I called because I just want... I need to talk.
<s> I hope not.
<s> Taken.
<s> That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
<s> It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
<s> Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
<s> No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
<s> What's that? Free!
<s> Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
<s> Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
<s> We could make a run for it?
<s> No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
<s> Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
<s> You sure got a handle on that word "we".
<s> I thought that was part of the charm!
<s> Thought of everything haven't you.
<s> No....The Asylum!
<s> Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
<s> Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
<s> We don't speak Czech!
<s> Who put a bee up your butt?
<s> Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
<s> Both, see you later.
<s> I fell in love.
<s> Holly!
<s> So I hear.
<s> Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
<s> Good, what's his number?
<s> We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
<s> Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
<s> I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
<s> No!
<s> They didn't look like medical files to me.
<s> Sure. Excellent.
<s> Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
<s> How about you Brutus?
<s> Don't worry it's okay!
<s> I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
<s> No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
<s> There's nothing there for me.
<s> Great. And your all set for the performance?
<s> Don't worry. Thanks.
<s> Great....How long will it go for?
<s> I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
<s> I had it coming from someone.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Uh-huh!
<s> Yeah, but it was okay.
<s> Fuck you!
<s> It was the biggest I could find.
<s> I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
<s> First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
<s> I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
<s> Working....Under cover.
<s> A drill, what are you up to?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
<s> Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
<s> Just yesterday.
<s> See you brought one of the patients with you too.
<s> Later.
<s> Why?
<s> It's time to go home, Holly.
<s> Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
<s> You bastard!
<s> This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
<s> In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
<s> The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
<s> With you.
<s> About a job.
<s> I don't want his money.
<s> Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
<s> Landon --
<s> Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
<s> No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
<s> Later.
<s> So you agree you need help?
<s> Know so.
<s> That is my telescope.
<s> Looking for something -- someone.
<s> You don't miss a thing.
<s> That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
<s> Thank you. So were you.
<s> Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
<s> It means you can do anything.
<s> Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
<s> I wanted this to be a date.
<s> We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
<s> Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
<s> Not possible.
<s> Where?
<s> Where's the one you're building?
<s> Mars.
<s> No. Why? Are you seducible?
<s> That what you do?
<s> Yes, one of many.
<s> No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
<s> I will.
<s> Anything you want.
<s> I used to like yogurt.
<s> That's what I mean.
<s> Better. I was really angry.
<s> It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
<s> It was a play.
<s> That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
<s> If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
<s> In there.
<s> Yes.
<s> I want to come back.
<s> Please.
<s> I didn't say you did.
<s> A similar triangle?
<s> What do you want, Biff?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Uh, yes, sir...
<s> No....
<s> Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
<s> Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
<s> You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
<s> Eileen, Chinese food again?
<s> Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
<s> Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
<s> You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
<s> Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
<s> Marty. Marty Lewis.
<s> Run out of gas?
<s> What?
<s> Five cents, please.
<s> Shhhhhhhh!
<s> Oh, right, right... 
<s> The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
<s> Is Shemp all right?
<s> You know me?
<s> A mall?
<s> You were ringing the doorbell!
<s> Well, it was there.
<s> You did what?!?
<s> Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
<s> Perfect...
<s> But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
<s> Sure,.
<s> No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
<s> Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Okay.
<s> Okay.
<s> Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
<s> You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
<s> I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
<s> Sure.
<s> What're you doing?
<s> What for?
<s> What?
<s> He'll say that?
<s> There you go.
<s> Spanish.
<s> Something mi trabajo.
<s> There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
<s> He was nervous.
<s> Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
<s> Just gimme a chance.
<s> The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
<s> And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
<s> Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
<s> Just 'grazed' you, huh?
<s> What is it, Tommy?
<s> Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
<s> To get my guns.
<s> John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
<s> Which?  The one in my throat.
<s> What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
<s> Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
<s> She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
<s> Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
<s> Penny--?!  Are you all right?
<s> Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
<s> Doesn't look anything like her to me.
<s> Please, Barton.
<s> ...I know this must look... funny.
<s> That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
<s> ...Who is this?
<s> Before Bill came to Hollywood.
<s> I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
<s> That's hamburger grease, Bill.
<s> Drown all those rascals...
<s> Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
<s> So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
<s> Well... actually, no Bill...
<s> And what would that be, son?
<s> I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
<s> I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
<s> We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
<s> Well I...
<s> Well not much.
<s> But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
<s> Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
<s> Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
<s> Have you read the Bible, Garland?
<s> That's all right, really, thank you.
<s> Can be. Not easy, but 
<s> That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
<s> Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
<s> Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
<s> Hell, I could tell you some stories
<s> Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
<s> See you, Charlie.
<s> Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
<s> Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
<s> Seems like nothing but, lately.
<s> Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
<s> Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me  I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
<s> I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
<s> No... Can I come in?
<s> Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
<s> You gotta believe me 
<s> Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
<s> Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
<s> Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> Yes sir, they 
<s> I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
<s> You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
<s> He's a little funny in the head.
<s> Only fry you once.
<s> Home. Watching TV.
<s> What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
<s> Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
<s> She was there, wasn't she?
<s> You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
<s> Thanks.
<s> It's bullshit.  You know it is.
<s> It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I thought you quit.
<s> Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
<s> Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
<s> She knows stuff about me that only you know.
<s> Yes.
<s> It won't last.
<s> I have nothing to hide.
<s> No.
<s> You know all about me.
<s> No.
<s> I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
<s> I know, Nicky, but I like it.
<s> What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
<s> There's Pepsi in the fridge.
<s> What do you want from me, Catherine?
<s> What's it about?
<s> I'll risk it.
<s> Try me.
<s> No.
<s> I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
<s> What are you researching?
<s> It won't sell.
<s> Somebody has to die.
<s> What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
<s> We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
<s> Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
<s> He was murdered.
<s> What are you doing here, Pop?
<s> Somethin', though.
<s> Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
<s> I know what that's like.
<s> You don't like punk rockers?
<s> Why the hell not?
<s> Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
<s> Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
<s> Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
<s> On what basis?
<s> Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
<s> Did you check all four years?
<s> Can you check again?
<s> He was shot.
<s> Not sure. How was yours?
<s> What about the shit they write?
<s> Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
<s> Do you still love her?
<s> We can do better. It needed more white.
<s> When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
<s> That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
<s> Aren't they?
<s> I really think you should talk to him about this.
<s> You want a drink?
<s> I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
<s> You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
<s> I need a dealer.
<s> I'm here.
<s> I hate this. Turn that off.
<s> Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
<s> Yup.
<s> Really?
<s> Out?
<s> Yeah..
<s> Willie Mays.
<s> Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
<s> Come on in!
<s> Good. What do you have?
<s> I guess it was a long time ago.
<s> Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
<s> I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
<s> Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
<s> C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
<s> It's Monday morning.
<s> Basquiat, what did you take?
<s> You want some?
<s> I hadn't thought about it.
<s> Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
<s> What's that about?
<s> They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
<s> Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
<s> You don't even know me. I want real respect.
<s> Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
<s> Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
<s> That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
<s> I didn't know.
<s> I'm -- sorry, I --
<s> Hanging on every word.
<s> Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
<s> Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
<s> Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
<s> Yes and no ...
<s> I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
<s> And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
<s> No darker than yours, Bruce.
<s> Yeah?  Me too...
<s> Had one.  Didn't work.
<s> I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
<s> Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
<s> Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
<s> Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
<s> Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
<s> It does to me.
<s> He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
<s> Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
<s> Silent night, violent night...
<s> A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
<s> Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
<s> Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
<s> Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
<s> And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
<s> Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
<s> Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
<s> Yes?
<s> Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
<s> What seems to be the problem?
<s> Coming on line now, sir.
<s> Alfred's happy here.
<s> Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
<s> Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
<s> The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
<s> I can make it.
<s> I know.  The feeling just vanished.
<s> Just the beast.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
<s> Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
<s> We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
<s> Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
<s> Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
<s> She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
<s> She wants to kill you.
<s> Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
<s> Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
<s> I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
<s> You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
<s> A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
<s> No. You said I. I killed them.
<s> He ran away?
<s> Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
<s> What?
<s> Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
<s> Mystery.
<s> How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
<s> I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
<s> I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
<s> For _me_? Really? Tell me.
<s> Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
<s> What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
<s> Nostrovia.
<s> Slanta.
<s> Banzai.
<s> Just ones this beautiful.
<s> Wacko? That a technical term?
<s> Would you? I'm not so sure.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> What?
<s> Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
<s> Excuse me.
<s> I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> What I do isn't about revenge.
<s> Yesssssss. I know!
<s> ...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
<s> Please. I swear I won't say noth-
<s> Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
<s> Never heard of a double-cross?
<s> You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
<s> Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
<s> ... Very good, sir.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> ... Murderer...
<s> I know. I called them.
<s> ... A hundred and eight?
<s> I won't let you have it.
<s> You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
<s> Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
<s> Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
<s> ... Terror.
<s> Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
<s> I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
<s> No one would miss me.
<s> Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
<s> I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
<s> I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
<s> Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
<s> No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
<s> Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
<s> I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
<s> JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
<s> Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
<s> What?  I improved her a little...
<s> All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
<s> Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
<s> Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
<s> Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
<s> God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
<s> Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
<s> And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
<s> I said I'd check with you.
<s> Did you really ask?
<s> Your face smells like a foot.
<s> David, I'm serious!
<s> It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
<s> Right first time.
<s> oh dear.
<s> Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
<s> Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
<s> Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
<s> Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
<s> No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
<s> Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
<s> It's you and Mom that need to talk.
<s> Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
<s> No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
<s> Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
<s> How the hell should I know?
<s> Okay.....
<s> Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
<s> Of course he is.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
<s> Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
<s> Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
<s> And Boot-Head.
<s> What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
<s> Uh... Uh...
<s> Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
<s> Me first?
<s> Huh huh huh.
<s> Huh huh. No way, dude.
<s> Heh heh. Thank God.
<s> Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
<s> Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
<s> Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
<s> Uh... dill, um, face...
<s> That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
<s> You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
<s> Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
<s> Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
<s> Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
<s> It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
<s> Where are his pants?
<s> Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
<s> Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
<s> Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
<s> That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
<s> Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
<s> Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
<s> Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
<s> Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
<s> We're rich in what really matters.
<s> So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
<s> Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
<s> No, I'm not putting up with this.
<s> Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<s> You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
<s> Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
<s> Of course I did.
<s> I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
<s> What makes you think she likes me?
<s> Just a hunch.
<s> All right.
<s> We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
<s> I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
<s> I got an A!
<s> W... We didn't know how to make one.
<s> D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
<s> Can you scare them off?
<s> No.  What's wrong?
<s> We tried.
<s> We have to start simpler, is that it?
<s> We need help.  We deserve help.
<s> No, wait!
<s> No, Lydia, we're dead.
<s> Step... mother.
<s> 'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
<s> Just <u>say</u> it.
<s> That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
<s> He's a cloven-hooved beast!
<s> It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
<s> There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
<s> We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
<s> What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
<s> Delia hates it.
<s> Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
<s> Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
<s> Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
<s> I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
<s> This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
<s> Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
<s> I'm sorry already.
<s> I thought I saw something.
<s> Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
<s> That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
<s> Oh, fine.
<s> ... Straight out?
<s> Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
<s> It's fine today, Robert.
<s> Hardly any, Robert.
<s> No, Robert.
<s> Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
<s> It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
<s> Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
<s> I don't think so, he should be along soon...
<s> And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
<s> No sir, I don't believe I do.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Yes. I would like to be on that show.
<s> It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
<s> I agree.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
<s> Yes.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> Yes, so do we.
<s> That's good. I like to watch, too.
<s> Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
<s> Yes. That could be true.
<s> Thank you, Eve.
<s> No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
<s> That's very interesting, Eve.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
<s> Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
<s> Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
<s> I agree.
<s> Yes, I agree, I think so too.
<s> I certainly do.
<s> Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
<s> Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
<s> No, Ben.
<s> A flower...
<s> I can't read.
<s> Yes.
<s> Good day, Sally.
<s> I agree.
<s> Of course. I would like to look.
<s> ... Yes. You can take me.
<s> How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
<s> I see.
<s> Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
<s> Yes. I was there with Ben.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. We need a very good gardener.
<s> Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
<s> I live here.
<s> Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
<s> Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
<s> No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
<s> I would like to stay and work in my garden.
<s> As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
<s> Try again.
<s> Try again.
<s> I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
<s> Hello, Sophie.
<s> It's not that, I just...
<s> Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
<s> He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
<s> Very good, Your Excellency.
<s> Right, Chief.
<s> Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
<s> Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
<s> I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
<s> Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
<s> The one where you're that jewel thief.
<s> Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
<s> The ferret?
<s> Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
<s> Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
<s> Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
<s> I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
<s> I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
<s> Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
<s> What's that?
<s> Yes.
<s> Me and John.
<s> I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
<s> It'll never happen, fuckface.
<s> I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
<s> Simulates?
<s> I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
<s> This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
<s> Schwartz.
<s> Yes?
<s> I am a trained performer.
<s> Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
<s> That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
<s> Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
<s> More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
<s> Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
<s> I'm right?
<s> Maxine.
<s> Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
<s> I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
<s> Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
<s> I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
<s> A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
<s> Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
<s> J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
<s> Ha ha ha!
<s> Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
<s> Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
<s> Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
<s> Says who?
<s> I'm sure you're not going crazy.
<s> Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
<s> No you mustn't, my child.
<s> You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
<s> After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
<s> Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
<s> Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
<s> A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, I'm really glad you called.
<s> Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
<s> I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
<s> You mean with Malkovich?
<s> You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
<s> No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
<s> Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
<s> Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
<s> But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
<s> Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
<s> Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
<s> I'm saying they came into my yard.
<s> I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
<s> I WILL PROTECT YOU.
<s> YES.
<s> Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
<s> That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
<s> We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
<s> More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
<s> I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
<s> I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
<s> Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
<s> Extra?
<s> OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
<s> No, let her rest.
<s> DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
<s> NO!...She wanted me to do it.
<s> But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
<s> Oh I been out.
<s> Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
<s> I don't know him that well.
<s> Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
<s> Aw, no, Ella.
<s> If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
<s> For what?
<s> Never found out.
<s> I don't believe that. I won't.
<s> She was only-
<s> Who is she? Where she come from?
<s> You got to get up from here, girl.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
<s> You're not dealing with morons here.
<s> Shit.
<s> No, man, nothing is fucked here--
<s> Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
<s> Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
<s> Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
<s> I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
<s> Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
<s> Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
<s> Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
<s> Walter, how--
<s> Were you listening to the story, Donny?
<s> Were you listening to the Dude's story?
<s> I'm shomer shabbas.
<s> They were Nazis, Dude?
<s> Well--
<s> That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
<s> Hey, is this him with Nancy?
<s> He's handicapped, huh?
<s> Far out.
<s> Different mothers, huh?
<s> I see.
<s> --and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
<s> And was there anything of value in the car?
<s> Separate incidents?
<s> What's your drink, Dude?
<s> Take a look at this, sir.
<s> I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
<s> Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
<s> I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
<s> The main guy, Dieter--
<s> Well--yeah, I guess--
<s> Oh?
<s> He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
<s> Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
<s> What?
<s> Walter, he peed on my rug--
<s> Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
<s> Okay. That, uh.
<s> You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
<s> Just, just take it easy, Walter.
<s> Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
<s> Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
<s> What if it's during a game?
<s> It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
<s> What the fuck is going on there?
<s> Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
<s> Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
<s> I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
<s> What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
<s> I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
<s> They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
<s> What about the toe?
<s> All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
<s> Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
<s> Now Dude--
<s> No, I'm--
<s> The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
<s> Huh?
<s> Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
<s> I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
<s> Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
<s> Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
<s> Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
<s> You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
<s> He can't walk, Walter!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No Dude.
<s> Wha.
<s> Wha. . . Donny--
<s> Walter--
<s> Yeah?
<s> Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
<s> Well we--I don't--
<s> Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
<s> Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
<s> Am I wrong!?
<s> A world of pain.
<s> We'll take 'em in the morning.
<s> Someday.
<s> We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
<s> Nothing.
<s> If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
<s> Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
<s> What?
<s> Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Not good.
<s> I don't like it.
<s> Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
<s> We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
<s> Where the hell have you been?
<s> Blood...
<s> So?
<s> Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
<s> Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
<s> Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
<s> They've made contact with the Reapers.
<s> Us?  What are you talking about?
<s> Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
<s> So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
<s> Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
<s> Wait.
<s> China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
<s> You're blind --
<s> How do I stop it?
<s> Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
<s> We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
<s> You make it sound like I'm already dead.
<s> Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
<s> This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
<s> Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
<s> Get away from him!
<s> Go on, I'll be fine!
<s> I'll take my chances.
<s> Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
<s> Because it means the tree is older than the house.
<s> A coward too. That's why she had to go.
<s> Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
<s> --Christ almighty--
<s> --it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
<s> No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
<s> So whoever built this--
<s> We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
<s> That's a joke?
<s> --doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
<s> You sure?
<s> What is <u>this</u>?
<s> --<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
<s> --fine, later, fine.
<s> You said the name "James."
<s> Yes.
<s> We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
<s> Get your goddamn--
<s> --you should get back into bed.
<s> I can't.
<s> --fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
<s> Yeah.
<s> I can't.
<s> I can't let you in.
<s> Both. Now.
<s> --hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
<s> What? That made her lose the baby?
<s> Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
<s> Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
<s> --fuckin' A right--
<s> --which'd be about ten bucks--
<s> I do.
<s> So where the hell am I going to sleep?
<s> Ask me what I don't have.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> Butt-ugly owl.
<s> What're you, nuts?
<s> No idea--goddamitt!
<s> --I don't know.
<s> The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
<s> --before you lose your emotional lunch.
<s> --I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
<s> Look over there.
<s> Asleep--
<s> A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
<s> Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
<s> Ancient runes--
<s> Why she kills children.
<s> Still working on it.
<s> No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
<s> It touched me, don't you see it now?
<s> That's why she kills children.
<s> Sure. I'm sorry.
<s> --she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
<s> Domini.
<s> There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
<s> Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
<s> No, I--
<s> Sort of...
<s> See a guy.
<s> ...Huh?
<s> Thanks.
<s> I don't know. I better get off now.
<s> I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
<s> What the hell happened, Ray?
<s> ...What was that?
<s> Isn't that what you want?
<s> I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
<s> Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
<s> You owe me for two weeks.
<s> No. It just made them feel better.
<s> Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
<s> I didn't say that.  Well?
<s> I want you to go fishing.
<s> ...What kind of fish?
<s> Nah, I trust ya.
<s> Right. Sorry.
<s> What's the point?
<s> We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
<s> Tuesday.
<s> Okay honey.
<s> Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
<s> Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
<s> You did? A human ear?
<s> Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
<s> No. not at all.
<s> Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
<s> Then, shut up!
<s> If you want to.
<s> Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
<s> Alright, suit yourself.
<s> Jeffrey nothing.
<s> I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
<s> I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing. Are you alright?
<s> Yes.
<s> See my nipples?
<s> No. please. I won't.
<s> Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
<s> Then don't talk about killing.
<s> O.K.
<s> . same here.
<s> There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
<s> No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
<s> Don?. Are you in with them?
<s> Sure I do.
<s> Whatiya mean?
<s> No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
<s> Kiss me.
<s> Just get outta my bed.
<s> There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
<s> If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
<s> Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
<s> It's okay. it's okay.
<s> Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
<s> FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
<s> Here's to Ben.
<s> Am I bothering you?
<s> Yeah. What are you doing now?
<s> Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
<s> Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
<s> My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
<s> You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
<s> Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
<s> First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
<s> You better not, Jeffrey.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Jeffrey!!
<s> You like mysteries that much?
<s> Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
<s> Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
<s> What is it?
<s> Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
<s> I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
<s> Really. you want to dance with someone else?
<s> Frank!!
<s> OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
<s> Hey Jeff.
<s> uh uh.
<s> It's good to see you, Dad.
<s> I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
<s> Alright.
<s> Looks like you'd make a good runner.
<s> I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
<s> Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
<s> Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
<s> I'll get a coat for her.
<s> Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
<s> Okay.
<s> ... Stop it Mike.
<s> Um-hmm.
<s> What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
<s> My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
<s> This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
<s> What is?
<s> Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
<s> Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
<s> Baby, you didn't have to come.
<s> Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
<s> What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
<s> What?  Yeah, sure.
<s> We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
<s> Barbara and me.  No one else.
<s> Yeah.  She told me.
<s> Oh hey, one more thing?
<s> Nothing.  Just a little project.
<s> Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
<s> Good night.
<s> Now do you see what I am saying?
<s> Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
<s> I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
<s> I just got released five minutes ago.
<s> Just sell it, Derek.
<s> Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
<s> George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
<s> Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
<s> You're a lucky man, Diego.
<s> Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
<s> Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
<s> Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
<s> The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
<s> Take your boots off.  You're tan.
<s> Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
<s> I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
<s> With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
<s> I'm going to California.
<s> You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
<s> Not mad.
<s> Dad.
<s> Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
<s> Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
<s> What do you guys want?
<s> Tuna.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Why are you smiling?
<s> Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
<s> Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
<s> Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
<s> Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
<s> Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
<s> Yeah, you will.  Of course.
<s> What's happening to us?
<s> Are we gonna split up?
<s> Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
<s> You can call me Dad if you want.
<s> No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
<s> California.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Okay, George.
<s> What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
<s> This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
<s> Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
<s> Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
<s> Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
<s> Don't be such a pussy.
<s> And you believe the NLF?
<s> The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
<s> I understand. What's your question?
<s> You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
<s> I'll explain.
<s> Sure. By shooting at me.
<s> C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
<s> Here?
<s> It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
<s> Good evening, sir.
<s> Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
<s> Yes ... But let me first see you.
<s> Why?
<s> Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
<s> She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
<s> Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
<s> We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
<s> We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
<s> It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
<s> No -- never.
<s> Sit down, Frank.
<s> Back off, John.
<s> Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
<s> Rebecca Lawson.
<s> His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
<s> For about one year.
<s> She left me.
<s> Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
<s> It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
<s> What did she say?
<s> Thank you.  The State rests.
<s> Yes -- Insulin and others.
<s> No.
<s> No -- she asked me about cocaine.
<s> That's all Dr. Paley.
<s> That's enough.
<s> She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
<s> One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
<s> While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
<s> What changed?
<s> Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
<s> I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
<s> What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
<s> Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
<s> You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
<s> Yes.
<s> A.M -- or P.M.?
<s> You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
<s> No.
<s> You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
<s> Hi.  It's Frank.
<s> It won't be that hard.
<s> Is that what you think I was thinking?
<s> She's mistaken.
<s> It's only the beginning.
<s> Are you scared?
<s> I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
<s> I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
<s> The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
<s> No, Your Honor.
<s> Mr. Roston?
<s> How often do you use cocaine?
<s> I'm always open to learning new things.
<s> Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
<s> Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
<s> You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
<s> Why are there two deeds here?
<s> I said NO!
<s> Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
<s> Well, there's a problem.
<s> Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
<s> '82.
<s> I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
<s> Well, what am I supposed to think?
<s> I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
<s> Did we want to?
<s> -- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
<s> Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
<s> No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
<s> No.
<s> Maybe it's because I live here.
<s> Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Much.
<s> They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
<s> No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
<s> Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
<s> No. I'll do them later.
<s> I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
<s> Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
<s> I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
<s> No.
<s> Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
<s> Do you want to leave your husband?
<s> Yeah. See you later.
<s> Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
<s> Oh, how is he?
<s> Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
<s> How about Italy?
<s> Why?
<s> I sat outside and had coffee.
<s> Because I already tried once.
<s> You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> What?
<s> Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
<s> What makes it different, Robert?
<s> Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
<s> TO HELL WITH YOU!
<s> But now that you have it -
<s> Yes. And I've accepted.
<s> I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
<s> I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
<s> Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
<s> Later. Go back to sleep.
<s> I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
<s> I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
<s> Frannie.
<s> Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
<s> What's she like?
<s> Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
<s> Apparently just before her death.
<s> WHAT!
<s> Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
<s> Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
<s> The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
<s> Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
<s> I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
<s> That's some terrible shit.
<s> Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
<s> Wh-wh-whooo?
<s> What it will be.
<s> I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
<s> It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
<s> That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
<s> How did you get in here?
<s> I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
<s> You mean as opposed to your life?
<s> Who?
<s> Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
<s> Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
<s> It's alright.  If you want to go home...
<s> Bill!  Bill?!
<s> Okay, okay.  Listen:
<s> You got the shit?
<s> I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
<s> Fuck it.  Alright.
<s> You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
<s> Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
<s> Or you didn't know what to do with it.
<s> That's it.  Get out.  Now!
<s> You was just doing your job.
<s> We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
<s> Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
<s> No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
<s> Potential toxic dump site.
<s> That building?
<s> Should I?
<s> Save him?  What are you talking about?
<s> Ours!
<s> What we have to do is call the police.
<s> You want to get into this now?
<s> I think you're fucking crazy!
<s> Where's what?
<s> Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
<s> All part of the business.
<s> No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
<s> What are you going to do with it?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What are you, drunk?
<s> No!  They're still on their way.
<s> Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
<s> Caesar, what are we going to do?
<s> But it could be anywhere.
<s> The hell I can't!
<s> Caesar, what are we going to do?
<s> Let us go and we'll make a deal.
<s> You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
<s> They were in a car accident.
<s> They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
<s> I should have let him kill you.
<s> Good idea.
<s> Are you okay, Violet?
<s> What?  They ain't there?
<s> Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
<s> Where in the hell is he?
<s> Leave your phone on the hook.
<s> Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
<s> How do I know you are cops?
<s> I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
<s> ...  thank you.
<s> Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
<s> Pretty much.  One day at a time.
<s> I knew it.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Maybe.
<s> What?
<s> Shit, here we go.
<s> Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
<s> What about that guy this morning?
<s> What choice?
<s> You think I'm lying?
<s> To let it dry.
<s> Good.
<s> Johnnie?
<s> Like each other?  They hate each other.
<s> It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
<s> Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
<s> Thank you.
<s> That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
<s> You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
<s> No.
<s> Violet?
<s> I don't know what we're talking about.
<s> I thought you were never going to do that.
<s> You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
<s> Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
<s> I want a second opinion.
<s> -- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> ...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
<s> ...it's a problem...
<s> Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.

<s> Right.
<s> I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
<s> Yeah, I know...
<s> One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
<s> Yes, I'm here...
<s> Okay.
<s> I hadn't heard.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
<s> I won't hurt you.
<s> Listen to what you want.
<s> Nothing.  It's just not there.
<s> Thanks for the ride.
<s> I guess so.
<s> All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
<s> ...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
<s> -- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
<s> Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
<s> I didn't know this would happen.
<s> You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
<s> I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
<s> Who paid the bill?
<s> What?

<s> -- here we go -- I found it --
<s> All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
<s> Enhance it.
<s> Abbott wants to talk.
<s> I told you.  You need to rest.
<s> I fixed it myself.
<s> ...Yer nostril?
<s> ... get to it.
<s> What? How do you know my name?
<s> Her name is Jill.
<s> David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
<s> That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
<s> Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
<s> Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
<s> Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
<s> Even later.
<s> Er, I knew you looked different.
<s> What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
<s> I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
<s> I'm sure you have
<s> Very smart.
<s> Yes. I'm impressed.
<s> She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
<s> Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
<s> Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
<s> Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
<s> Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
<s> You're the only person I can trust.
<s> We don't make mistakes.
<s> Do you know what you're doing.
<s> I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
<s> What?
<s> Jack ...
<s> You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
<s> No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
<s> What?
<s> Really.
<s> What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
<s> Who will?
<s> Go away.
<s> Take care.
<s> The refund for Tuttle!
<s> I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
<s> Next of kin!
<s> I delivered it.
<s> Yes.
<s> All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
<s> Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
<s> A woman eh? I see.
<s> Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
<s> Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
<s> I know, I know ...!
<s> I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
<s> Er, yes ...
<s> Hello. Mr Lowry?
<s> Central Services.
<s> Fixed itself.
<s> Have you got one or haven't you?
<s> What?
<s> What if there is no tomorrow?
<s> Pregnant.
<s> She's having a baby. Twins.
<s> I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
<s> Mary, we really have to go.
<s> Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
<s> That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
<s> Just take it easy.
<s> No.
<s> I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
<s> Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
<s> He's going to be all right, right?
<s> Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
<s> Yeah?
<s> His heart's beating.
<s> The first is always the best.
<s> Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
<s> She should go home.
<s> You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
<s> He's better, though, right?
<s> You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
<s> We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
<s> Because you can barely walk.
<s> It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
<s> No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
<s> The ghosts--
<s> Make a left here. I want to stop.
<s> Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
<s> I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
<s> Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
<s> How can that be? He was getting better.
<s> He was tough. You did all you could.
<s> You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
<s> Yes.
<s> Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
<s> C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
<s> I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> What?
<s> You're burned out.
<s> Relax, will you.
<s> Used to be my partner.
<s> You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
<s> You write this?
<s> Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
<s> You've made my dreams silly.
<s> And the rule was...
<s> There are only ten.
<s> I'll see you back at the hotel.
<s> Are you any closer to a decision?
<s> Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
<s> Yes.
<s> Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
<s> I don't like the word gay.
<s> At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
<s> No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
<s> Did you shoot their boots?
<s> Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
<s> They're not that dumb, after all.
<s> Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
<s> You too.
<s> No.
<s> No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
<s> Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
<s> Let me think a second.  It's tough.
<s> Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
<s> Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
<s> I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
<s> Really?
<s> Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
<s> In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
<s> Outside?
<s> Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
<s> Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
<s> It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
<s> I understand.  I'll go with you.
<s> Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
<s> Almost immediately.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll speak to you soon
<s> I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
<s> Yes?
<s> I spent a fortune on this.
<s> It's started.
<s> No stop where he's all besieged.
<s> Thanks a lot, Buddy.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh.
<s> Honey?...
<s> No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
<s> No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
<s> I like "godsend."
<s> Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
<s> No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
<s> How's it going?
<s> Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
<s> I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
<s> Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
<s> What?
<s> Why, you need me for the story?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
<s> It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
<s> Good.  That's it...See you.
<s> Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
<s> I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
<s> He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
<s> How can you say that to me?
<s> You fucking...
<s> It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
<s> You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
<s> You want to come?
<s> Then you should stay here.
<s> Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
<s> I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
<s> Right back to you.
<s> Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
<s> Not anymore!
<s> Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
<s> Whaddya mean?
<s> Is the manager cooperating?
<s> Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
<s> Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
<s> He made a cat.
<s> I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
<s> Better!
<s> There there...
<s> Walter!  Jeez!
<s> Bye!
<s> You think I'm creative?
<s> Walter, I'm sorry...
<s> I hope this was made with egg whites!
<s> Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
<s> I wouldn't give up your day job.
<s> I know, man.
<s> I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
<s> I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
<s> Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
<s> Didn't you hear him?
<s> Well I was uh, just looking...
<s> Dead Cat?
<s> Have a seat -
<s> You want me to open a window or something?
<s> These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
<s> You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
<s> Put it down, Walter.
<s> Well, w-what did you do?
<s> I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
<s> Uh, sure.
<s> Huh?!!!
<s> Walter shut up and relax!
<s> I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
<s> "Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
<s> T-turned on?
<s> I can't.  I gotta go home.
<s> I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
<s> Gee.  Thanks.
<s> Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
<s> Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
<s> Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
<s> Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
<s> Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
<s> We hate you guys!
<s> What's playing there?
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> Don't tread on the earth?
<s> Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
<s> Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
<s> It's the news, Buffy.
<s> Hi.
<s> 'Bye.
<s> You weren't home.  Like always.
<s> Buffy.
<s> No, you're not.
<s> Besides, Oxnard sucks.
<s> For the dance.
<s> I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
<s> You say that like it's a bad thing.
<s> We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
<s> Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
<s> I forgot.
<s> Wait!
<s> I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
<s> In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
<s> This is it.
<s> All right.
<s> Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
<s> We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
<s> I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
<s> Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
<s> Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
<s> Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
<s> Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
<s> Fine.
<s> It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
<s> Don't start with me again.
<s> Buffy...
<s> I...
<s> Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
<s> My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
<s> I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
<s> I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
<s> Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
<s> How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
<s> Cassandra's really smart.
<s> You're having a fling with him?
<s> Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
<s> Really?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Got that.
<s> No --
<s> Where'd you learn how to do that?
<s> Buffy?
<s> What is she...
<s> Does Jeffrey know?
<s> Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
<s> He is so bald.
<s> Oh, please.
<s> Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
<s> Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
<s> Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
<s> You can learn to like it.
<s> Big League pitchers don't use these.
<s> Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
<s> Switch nostrils?
<s> If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
<s> A little better.
<s> Nuke?!
<s> Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
<s> Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
<s> Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
<s> Oh--won't YOU come in?
<s> Oh my...  Don't leave...
<s> I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
<s> Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
<s> Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
<s> I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
<s> Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
<s> Aren't we all?
<s> I said when I think about you, I get wet.
<s> I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
<s> It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
<s> What?
<s> Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
<s> He looks wonderful, Jackson...
<s> He'll learn.
<s> The socks?  It's cold in here.
<s> Who's he play for?
<s> Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
<s> If you believe in Voodoo.
<s> Beg me again!
<s> I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
<s> Gimme that.
<s> 'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
<s> A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
<s> God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
<s> By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
<s> Go for it.
<s> God--what a Big League move.
<s> If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
<s> Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
<s> You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
<s> I'm nervous--my old man's here.
<s> Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
<s> Forget it.
<s> The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
<s> 'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
<s> What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
<s> Love to--
<s> C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
<s> It's a damn easy thing to play with.
<s> It's a league record.
<s> He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
<s> They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
<s> What?
<s> Why are you doing this to me?
<s> Good to see ya.  William would you...
<s> He's lying.
<s> Yes, you were.
<s> Philip, if you would rise.
<s> ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
<s> I'm serious. No interference.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
<s> Right back.
<s> Yeah, sure I do. Why?
<s> I can't! I'm tied!
<s> I don't know.
<s> They payin'?
<s> Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
<s> Ginger.
<s> And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
<s> Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
<s> Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
<s> Then he called me a faggot.
<s> What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
<s> What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
<s> What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
<s> Nope, there's no way.
<s> Hey, Rich.
<s> It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
<s> I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
<s> No, I don't wanna come -
<s> I don't wanna come along with you.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
<s> Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
<s> The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
<s> I see you, you motherfuckers.
<s> Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
<s> Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
<s> And what'd she want?
<s> It's me.
<s> Well...
<s> Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
<s> Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
<s> No, that's quite all right.
<s> Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
<s> What can I do?
<s> No, Ace.
<s> Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
<s> 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
<s> We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
<s> I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
<s> Right away. Okay?
<s> Okay. 
<s> Good luck.
<s> We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
<s> I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
<s> Yeah, I know all that.
<s> You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
<s> I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
<s> It's chinchilla.
<s> You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
<s> Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
<s> Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
<s> What? What?!
<s> You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
<s> Okay.
<s> That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
<s> No, you don't.
<s> Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
<s> What's it...
<s> It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
<s> There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
<s> You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
<s> I threw it away.
<s> I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
<s> I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
<s> I should have -
<s> Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
<s> Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
<s> So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
<s> You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
<s> Not gonna let me in?
<s> In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
<s> We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
<s> What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
<s> These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
<s> Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
<s> Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
<s> A record of the arrests...
<s> You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
<s> Green?
<s> So, you're a righty?
<s> Get out of here.
<s> Mm.
<s> Mm.
<s> I didn't give 'em the m-
<s> You shut up.
<s> Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
<s> But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
<s> I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
<s> Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
<s> Please.
<s> If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
<s> Is that the last one?
<s> Carmine's gone.
<s> Calm down! Calm down!
<s> For what?
<s> But I'm just trying to leave.
<s> I'll take care of it, Remo.
<s> Yeah, I heard, yeah.
<s> I know.
<s> I'll tell him, Remo.
<s> Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
<s> I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
<s> Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
<s> All right.
<s> Mm, you want to steal it? 
<s> Nothin'.
<s> I don't - 
<s> Yeah?
<s> Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
<s> Is that what you want?
<s> I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
<s> Okay, yeah.
<s> But I saw something...
<s> You are.
<s> Here.
<s> What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
<s> You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
<s> 'Go! Go! Go!'
<s> You're driving me nuts!
<s> Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
<s> Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
<s> She asleep?
<s> Nicky sends his warmest regards.
<s> But he never talked.
<s> Yeah, what'd you tell him?
<s> You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
<s> Angelo and Buster.
<s> They'll do it.
<s> No more! You see? Watch!
<s> Fuck you!
<s> Charlie M.
<s> Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
<s> How you doin'?
<s> What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
<s> Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
<s> No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
<s> Oh, sorry -
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
<s> You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
<s> You are right. What can I...
<s> Yeah.
<s> You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
<s> Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
<s> It's okay. Let her go.
<s> At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
<s> Uh Brock, today you are without me...
<s> What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
<s> Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
<s> I lied.
<s> They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
<s> Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
<s> I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
<s> Even the skylight?
<s> Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
<s> "Well done," Cactus.
<s> I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
<s> Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
<s> It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
<s> Men, huh?
<s> "Pre-bicentennial babe?"
<s> What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
<s> Uh. "Thanks?"
<s> I actually got some memory back last night.
<s> I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
<s> I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
<s> You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
<s> Uh-huh..
<s> But I'm blind.
<s> "I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
<s> Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
<s> It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
<s> Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
<s> I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
<s> Where do you think you're going?
<s> I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
<s> I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
<s> This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
<s> Why would I do that?
<s> See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
<s> I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
<s> I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
<s> It's taken care of.
<s> Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
<s> I improved on the fucking original.
<s> It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
<s> What am I supposed to do?
<s> I was worried about you.  Both of you.
<s> Give me 20 minutes at least.
<s> I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
<s> I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
<s> You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
<s> No -- nothing.
<s> Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
<s> I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
<s> Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
<s> I'm trying to.
<s> The one in Brentwood.
<s> The City National on San Vincente.
<s> Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
<s> But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
<s> Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
<s> Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
<s> Lucky for them they didn't.
<s> Why can't it be her?
<s> Include me in that.
<s> Hand me the phone.
<s> There isn't any such person.
<s> As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
<s> No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
<s> That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
<s> Why are we stopping?
<s> We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
<s> We can't leave him to repeat anything.
<s> He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
<s> Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
<s> Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
<s> I don't want it.
<s> I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
<s> Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
<s> There are no guarantees in this life.
<s> A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
<s> Got a phone in that van?
<s> I wish it had never been invented.
<s> Just relax.
<s> You'll see her.
<s> Talk to the man.
<s> Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
<s> My pleasure --
<s> Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
<s> You'll still have the girl and the husband.
<s> Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
<s> You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
<s> What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
<s> If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
<s> My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
<s> You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
<s> Five minutes.
<s> Nobody can do anything right but you!
<s> From here on, I dish it out.
<s> Is that good or bad?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Did he?
<s> She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
<s> Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
<s> He wants to know do I mean that.
<s> No.
<s> The accent, I suppose.
<s> He's Scottish, Col.
<s> Must be.
<s> Hi. You forgot your bag.
<s> He wants me to perform for him.
<s> You know.
<s> You can't leave me then, can you?
<s> Whiskey.
<s> Jesus fucking Christ.
<s> Tell me about him.
<s> Yes...
<s> What do you think?
<s> If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
<s> Aha.
<s> I'm wondering why you keep his things.
<s> All the time.
<s> Dil --
<s> Never said a truer word.
<s> You think that's wise?
<s> So they do know.
<s> Not at all, honey.
<s> Not here.
<s> Kind of.
<s> You could say that.
<s> More than that.
<s> A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Sorry. What you doing?
<s> For me.
<s> Look on it like a honeymoon.
<s> Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
<s> You mean that?
<s> Only in times of extreme stress.
<s> You knew my Jody?
<s> Stop it, Dil --
<s> Got to be somewhere.
<s> I like you, Dil --
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's my name, Dil --
<s> As the man said, it's in my nature.
<s> You know her, Jimmy?
<s> Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
<s> Need to lose myself awhile.
<s> Fucking do. I had him all over me.
<s> Someone's got to do it.
<s> Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
<s> So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
<s> Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
<s> Would make me feel better about it.
<s> Who'd you think it was?
<s> I understand.
<s> Right.
<s> Can't.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
<s> Do what?
<s> Not in your nature.
<s> I'm talking about your people, not you.
<s> And you know the funny thing?
<s> I didn't even fancy her.
<s> No.
<s> Suppose you could say that.
<s> What the fuck were you doing here?
<s> You could have said no.
<s> Ever see hurling?
<s> Best game in the world.
<s> My pleasure, Jody
<s> Doesn't matter where.
<s> Like what?
<s> It's as simple as that?
<s> Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
<s> I don't know her.
<s> Stop it --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Why?
<s> You won't run.
<s> Who gives a fuck.
<s> Thought you liked me, bitch.
<s> You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
<s> What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
<s> It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
<s> Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
<s> Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
<s> How do you think I got here?
<s> Open up.
<s> I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
<s> Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
<s> No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
<s> Can you remember anything at all?
<s> I know, but this is all we've got left.
<s> Then who did? You're the only one left.
<s> Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
<s> What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
<s> Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
<s> You mean spies and things like that?
<s> Agent.
<s> Then whose is it? His or theirs?
<s> Oh, I see.
<s> But --
<s> Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
<s> There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
<s> Barely, yes.
<s> Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
<s> By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
<s> But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
<s> Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
<s> Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
<s> Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
<s> You're out, Dyle -- right now!
<s> It's all right with us --
<s> I'll take that.
<s> But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
<s> Would you like to see my passport?
<s> There must be some way.
<s> Reggie -- listen to me --
<s> Cutting it out.
<s> Oh. 
<s> I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
<s> No.
<s> Maybe.
<s> A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
<s> I'm scared.
<s> What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
<s> First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
<s> Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
<s> Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
<s> This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
<s> I dare you.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> It's a start, anyway.
<s> Go on.
<s> You mean, you're a thief?
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
<s> The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
<s> I'm afraid it is important.
<s> In money.
<s> And the last one?
<s> Tell me what?
<s> Stop it!
<s> I don't know. I suppose so.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.
<s> Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
<s> Is that all? Can I go now?
<s> Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
<s> What should we give him?
<s> Why, do you think we're going to?
<s> I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
<s> I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
<s> The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
<s> I'm Regina Lampert.
<s> No, you see, I don't really love him.
<s> Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
<s> Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
<s> Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
<s> Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
<s> I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
<s> Lay on, MacDuff.
<s> Having a nervous breakdown.
<s> That's what I'm not supposed to say.
<s> How about once more around the park?
<s> Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
<s> Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
<s> The man you had the fight with.
<s> Don't put yourself out.
<s> Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
<s> How can you tell?
<s> Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
<s> Oh la vache!
<s> What's the matter, chrie?
<s> What?
<s> He took care of Charlie for us.
<s> We want that money -- now!
<s> I think I know how to restore your reputation.
<s> I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
<s> But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
<s> I just wanted to check that you were okay?
<s> Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
<s> That's impossible.
<s> What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
<s> How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
<s> I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Run!
<s> She just turned off her light.
<s> She's still a virgin.
<s> No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
<s> My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
<s> Can you just follow me? The back is full?
<s> You know about that too?
<s> Of course I'm scared.
<s> Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
<s> He's a rapist. Like mine.
<s> Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
<s> I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
<s> You think you're my sister?
<s> I don't watch him eat everyday.
<s> The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
<s> What?
<s> What party?
<s> You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
<s> Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
<s> Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
<s> No.
<s> So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
<s> What?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Did Sharon say no?
<s> I do not.
<s> I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's not why we broke up.
<s> No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
<s> What?
<s> Attacked how?
<s> People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
<s> I got to go.
<s> Did you want one?
<s> They're tasty.
<s> Maybe you better just drive me home.

<s> You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
<s> Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
<s> I've got her.
<s> That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
<s> That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
<s> Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
<s> I think I'll kill her.
<s> You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
<s> Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
<s> How are you, Lou?
<s> How'd you get past the guards?
<s> Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
<s> Who?
<s> You're welcome to try. There he is.
<s> You mean that's what you're going to call it.
<s> Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
<s> And why's that?
<s> What for?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
<s> Gee, thanks, Lou.
<s> Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
<s> But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
<s> What are you having?
<s> Yeah. Fine, thank you.
<s> Mrs. Mulwray?
<s> Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
<s> It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
<s> I'll stop by.
<s> ...Just a minute...
<s> A check?
<s> Well, how much would you like?
<s> He told you?
<s> No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
<s> The Valley?
<s> And Hollis knew about it?
<s> No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
<s> Why?
<s> Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
<s> You didn't tell me.
<s> That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
<s> I want to see her.
<s> What the hell is this all about?
<s> I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
<s> She's my daughter.
<s> ...so that's why you hate him...
<s> How about a plane?
<s> I'm all right.
<s> He's in the dark room.
<s> Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
<s> When did you come in?
<s> You'll find one of those people.
<s> Perhaps if we could meet your father.
<s> Oh, good.
<s> I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
<s> Maybe he takes it very seriously.
<s> I never was.
<s> Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
<s> Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
<s> Well, no.
<s> What about the water?
<s> Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
<s> Who?
<s> I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
<s> Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
<s> Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
<s> Yeah, I'll do that.
<s> Since lunch.
<s> I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
<s> He owned it.
<s> All she needed for that was the phone book!
<s> Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
<s> Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
<s> No, you have a press agent do it.
<s> Fifty lire... 
<s> Toto, come here.
<s> Then why don't you change jobs? 
<s> Too bad!
<s> Yes. 
<s> Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
<s> What's she like? What's she like?...
<s> What you say is wonderful! But sad...
<s> But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
<s> I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
<s> No. And nobody knows where she is.
<s> Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
<s> I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
<s> Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
<s> Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
<s> Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
<s> Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
<s> He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
<s> That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
<s> -  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
<s> Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
<s> I'm going back there.
<s> He made an awful lot of money.
<s> Certainly not.
<s> Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
<s> Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
<s> It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
<s> It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
<s> It isn't finished?
<s> He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
<s> There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
<s> I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
<s> The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
<s> Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
<s> He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
<s> I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
<s> I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
<s> You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
<s> I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
<s> Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> You're no Venus de Milo.
<s> On the chiffonier.  Here.
<s> And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
<s> I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
<s> Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
<s> Half past eleven.
<s> Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
<s> As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
<s> Susan!
<s> Susan, it seems to me -
<s> Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
<s> In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
<s> Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
<s> It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
<s> You can't.
<s> Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
<s> I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir -
<s> Do you know what that is?
<s> What're you going to do, Charlie?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
<s> Charlie -
<s> - and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
<s> What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
<s> What's wrong, Brad?
<s> I'll get you some coffee.
<s> She's going to leave you -
<s> The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
<s> You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
<s> Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
<s> It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
<s> I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
<s> What do you mean by that?
<s> You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
<s> You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
<s> It's a letter from her lawyers.
<s> Sure.
<s> All we saw on that screen was a big American -
<s> Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
<s> If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
<s> I had a toothache.
<s> I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
<s> Am I sure?
<s> What is this, a poll?
<s> How long have you been a smoker?
<s> You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
<s> Okay. I'm sorry about that.
<s> You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
<s> I take it she likes the guy.
<s> Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
<s> Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
<s> There's no light back there.
<s> Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
<s> Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
<s> Awww. That was so cute.
<s> Dante. You've got a customer.
<s> No, you're not really getting married?
<s> I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
<s> Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
<s> Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
<s> Um... okay.
<s> We did.
<s> Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
<s> No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
<s> Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> In a second!
<s> Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
<s> "Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
<s> Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
<s> I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
<s> Go open the sore.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> What do you two fight about?
<s> Eight and a half?
<s> Chess team Allan Harris?!
<s> What about Veronica?
<s> Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
<s> Blasphemy.
<s> There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
<s> All right, Vader's boss...
<s> Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
<s> Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
<s> Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
<s> The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
<s> Basically.
<s> Let's hear it.
<s> Why not?
<s> Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
<s> Can you believe this?!
<s> At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
<s> Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
<s> Gatorade.
<s> You've had sex with a dead person.
<s> One night only. She's buried in the morning.
<s> Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
<s> An embarrassing way to die.
<s> That's embarrassing?
<s> I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
<s> Why should I loan you my car?
<s> Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
<s> And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
<s> Living proof.
<s> Little girl. Maybe five years old?
<s> She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
<s> I'm not.
<s> This is my way of spitting water at life.
<s> In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
<s> Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> This life.
<s> Why do I have this life?
<s> My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
<s> I was born.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
<s> What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
<s> My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
<s> Jesus.
<s> You need a ride?
<s> Helluva day.
<s> I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
<s> I don't have love handles.
<s> Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
<s> Yeah?
<s> The difference is you exploit a weakness.
<s> Veronica.
<s> No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
<s> So I'm told.
<s> Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
<s> Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
<s> I hate this fucking place.
<s> Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
<s> Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
<s> I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
<s> How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
<s> Including you?
<s> He gets off on it.
<s> Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
<s> Please calm down.
<s> All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
<s> Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
<s> And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
<s> I don't want to go back with her...
<s> WHAT?
<s> An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
<s> He's your cousin?
<s> I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
<s> You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
<s> He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
<s> He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
<s> My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
<s> No way!
<s> Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
<s> Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
<s> I like the way you think.
<s> I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
<s> I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
<s> Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
<s> You're gonna be at John K's party?
<s> You're not?
<s> Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
<s> Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
<s> Says who?
<s> Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
<s> I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
<s> Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
<s> Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
<s> They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
<s> So, what do you see?
<s> Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
<s> Hey, fuck you.
<s> No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
<s> I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
<s> There wasn't time for anything else.
<s> Is it really four thousand?
<s> That's it, you look like a professional.
<s> Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
<s> We spent a night there one night...
<s> On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
<s> After the funeral I just had to leave.
<s> Why are you yelling?
<s> Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
<s> I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
<s> He can handle it.
<s> I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Call me sentimental.
<s> Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
<s> Breathtaking.
<s> We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
<s> Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
<s> What?
<s> Jess, c'mon...
<s> Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
<s> I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
<s> Never could save a thing.
<s> No, he's gone.
<s> Tucker and Walker.
<s> It looks like a winding route.
<s> There.  You blind?
<s> Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
<s> Climb, Gabe, climb!
<s> I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
<s> We can't and he knows it.
<s> What about it?
<s> You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
<s> No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
<s> I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
<s> Richard Travers.
<s> You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
<s> We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
<s> A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
<s> I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
<s> ... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
<s> No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
<s> Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
<s> Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
<s> Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
<s> Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
<s> Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
<s> And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
<s> Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
<s> Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
<s> Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
<s> Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
<s> No, sir, I feel really great.
<s> Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
<s> Well - I'm back.
<s> Oh, aye, aye.
<s> Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
<s> Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
<s> Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
<s> ... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
<s> You wanna be sick?
<s> You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
<s> No, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Lice?
<s> Through there for a bath.
<s> Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
<s> You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
<s> Yes!!!
<s> I haven't seen you before.
<s> Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
<s> Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
<s> That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes!!!
<s> You're not cured yet, my boy.
<s> I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
<s> Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
<s> It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
<s> And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
<s> The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
<s> Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
<s> Are you feeling better?
<s> No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
<s> Sure thing.
<s> He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
<s> No, no, <u>wait</u>...
<s> Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
<s> You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
<s> Can't say that I do.
<s> Can you finish on schedule?
<s> Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
<s> I don't know...
<s> Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
<s> No harm done, ma'am.
<s> Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
<s> And you came all the way down here to see me?
<s> Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
<s> Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
<s> Yo, whassup?
<s> I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
<s> ...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
<s> Let's not get excited, sir.
<s> I was just tryin' to...to...
<s> Jesus, what is with this guy?
<s> I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
<s> <u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
<s> ...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
<s> ...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
<s> Oh.  Sorry.
<s> Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
<s> Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
<s> I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
<s> I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
<s> No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
<s> I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
<s> Who was he?
<s> Lenny, my dispatcher.
<s> I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes, Max?
<s> I'm not catching a melody.
<s> Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
<s> Leave me alone.
<s> <u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
<s> I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
<s> Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
<s> It's not bullshit.
<s> Dmitri?
<s> He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
<s> Makes two of us.
<s> Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
<s> One more.
<s> That's what you said...
<s> That's the reason?
<s> What happened to you?
<s> But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
<s> Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
<s> Who?
<s> Any special reason?
<s> But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
<s> Just drop me off.
<s> Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
<s> I can't promise you anything.
<s> Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
<s> What is?
<s> For what?
<s> Yeah.  I think so.
<s> Believe you about what?
<s> Flesh wound.  No big deal.
<s> Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
<s> This would be it?
<s> Pretty scary, huh?
<s> Who?
<s> I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
<s> Getting rid of my hub!
<s> Uh huh.
<s> It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
<s> How'd he die?
<s> Not this again.
<s> What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
<s> I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
<s> If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
<s> Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Not today.
<s> Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
<s> That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
<s> No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
<s> You knew just what I was there for.
<s> I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
<s> What about you?
<s> I can't promise you anything.
<s> Top pocket...  Go on.
<s> Could you be a little more specific?
<s> Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
<s> Then I can't be hurt anymore.
<s> Well, I don't know if --
<s> It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
<s> You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
<s> I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
<s> A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
<s> Fine.  What the hell is going on?
<s> Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
<s> As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
<s> Terminal?
<s> If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
<s> <u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
<s> Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
<s> If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
<s> I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
<s> Then this is a goddamn emergency.
<s> I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
<s> This doesn't make sense.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Wait --
<s> No.  Not yet.
<s> Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
<s> Yeah, I do.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
<s> Oh?  How's he doing?
<s> Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
<s> Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
<s> I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
<s> If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
<s> Are you threatening me?
<s> We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
<s> Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
<s> Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
<s> What would you have me say, David?
<s> I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
<s> Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
<s> Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
<s> This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
<s> I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
<s> Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
<s> We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
<s> Can you help us?
<s> You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
<s> Now... you go home.
<s> That's my girl...  Lights.
<s> You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
<s> Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
<s> Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
<s> Peter Valerian.
<s> Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
<s> Any luck on the grant money?
<s> -- I'm moving to Washington.
<s> This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
<s> Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
<s> It's really happening.
<s> I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
<s> Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
<s> And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
<s> Yes.  Very much.
<s> Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
<s> Really.
<s> I can't do this --
<s> Please --
<s> Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
<s> Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
<s> Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
<s> Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
<s> It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
<s> No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
<s> What are you doin' here?
<s> I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
<s> Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
<s> She took off with that convertible feller...
<s> Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
<s> Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
<s> I don't know, Boss.
<s> Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
<s> Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
<s> Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
<s> Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
<s> Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
<s> Tramp! Beautiful!
<s> Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
<s> What for?
<s> Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
<s> He's gonna be awright.
<s> Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
<s> Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
<s> The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
<s> That's it. That's the end.
<s> Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
<s> We got it locked in the sock.
<s> We ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> You just said he could eat anything.
<s> Forty-five.
<s> Cuter.
<s> He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
<s> But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
<s> Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
<s> No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
<s> Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
<s> I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
<s> I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
<s> Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
<s> Tell her about <u>what</u>?
<s> 'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
<s> What pattern was that?
<s> You get me out first.
<s> You already made the delivery?
<s> What Friday?
<s> He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
<s> She don't want it.
<s> Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
<s> I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
<s> No.  Not yet.
<s> Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
<s> Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
<s> If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
<s> Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
<s> It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
<s> Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
<s> Then what do you need me for?
<s> That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
<s> Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
<s> What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
<s> They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
<s> Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
<s> I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
<s> W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
<s> Well, thanks.
<s> The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
<s> That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
<s> Not yet.
<s> No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
<s> Is there a phone booth there?
<s> They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
<s> What else?
<s> He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
<s> She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
<s> Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
<s> You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
<s> Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
<s> Tell it to your shrink.
<s> Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
<s> Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
<s> With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
<s> It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
<s> You're damn right I do.
<s> What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
<s> If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
<s> I gotta have Ruben, and a...
<s> You got a suspect...
<s> Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
<s> You should have gone to the funeral.
<s> No. But when he's in that car...
<s> One of your suitors?
<s> James.
<s> I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
<s> That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
<s> That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
<s> When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
<s> I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
<s> I can drive.
<s> What?
<s> We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
<s> You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
<s> But everything's OK?
<s> I'll be back before you can say souffle.
<s> I know.    I know.
<s> No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
<s> Paul could pop the question at any time.
<s> And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
<s> Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
<s> And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
<s> I've already made arrangements.
<s> Don't be fresh.
<s> It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
<s> Lie?
<s> I answered these questions last night.
<s> It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
<s> You took bets on my diagnosis?
<s> It's magic.
<s> Enough with the abracadabra.
<s> No rounds for another three hours.
<s> Wow.    I'm bad news.
<s> What are the delusions like?
<s> Michael, I...
<s> I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
<s> No, I need some serious household advice.
<s> No.
<s> I'll see you tonight.
<s> Sounds grim.
<s> I got worried. Are you OK?
<s> When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
<s> It wasn't exactly a lie.
<s> Michael, take it easy.
<s> I guess so.
<s> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
<s> Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
<s> You just need to get more organized. L
<s> Especially this last year.
<s> So, I've been thinking a lot...
<s> So, what do you say, Let?
<s> I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
<s> I've met someone else.
<s> It doesn't matter who.
<s> So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
<s> I'm glad you're doing well.
<s> Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
<s> You killed her!
<s> A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
<s> Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
<s> Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
<s> It's Elvis...
<s> You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
<s> Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
<s> It's Daniel.
<s> Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
<s> Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
<s> I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
<s> Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
<s> You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
<s> I guess we're going to find out.
<s> How about if I call you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Why do I always have to answer the phone?
<s> And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
<s> Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
<s> I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
<s> All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
<s> No?
<s> Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
<s> You haven't answered my question.
<s> -- Did you set it up?
<s> Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
<s> You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
<s> Good song though.
<s> A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
<s> I don't know.     I didn't look.
<s> I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
<s> What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
<s> She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
<s> Relax. It will be fine.
<s> Yeah, I can see that.
<s> Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
<s> No!
<s> And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
<s> It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
<s> Wait here.
<s> He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
<s> Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
<s> Take a nap.
<s> Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
<s> Something like that.
<s> Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
<s> Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
<s> A little?
<s> A car.
<s> How's the arm?  Still sore?
<s> Wait!  I'm a friend!
<s> This Jade Fox is a woman?
<s> Real sharpness comes without effort.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Shut up!
<s> I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
<s> Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
<s> She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
<s> You're too young to understand.
<s> What do you think?
<s> You're probably right.
<s> Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
<s> Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
<s> Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
<s> Only the sword will settle this.
<s> What I've always wanted, to teach you.
<s> Kneel!
<s> All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
<s> It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
<s> Give it back.
<s> And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
<s> Let them look.
<s> You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
<s> But something is going on at the Yu household.
<s> I knew she would intrigue you.
<s> It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
<s> I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
<s> We must avenge mother!
<s> What does it say?
<s> Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
<s> Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
<s> Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
<s> What do you have in mind?
<s> Annie, I need a file.
<s> Don't thank me.
<s> You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
<s> I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
<s> I should be trying to stop you.
<s> Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
<s> I dabble.  May I?
<s> I have to go.
<s> She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
<s> Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
<s> You don't even remember...
<s> I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
<s> Interested?  Follow the crow.
<s> Shelly?
<s> Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
<s> I'm already alone.
<s> Very well, it's your ass.
<s> Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
<s> Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
<s> No shooting.
<s> The night is young.
<s> I'll be fine.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
<s> Really? I thought he said it all the time.
<s> Forever.
<s> No.
<s> I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
<s> Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
<s> Refreshing.
<s> No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
<s> No thank you.
<s> Give it up.
<s> Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
<s> Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
<s> Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
<s> Who?
<s> How about tonight?
<s> How was your date?
<s> I will.
<s> Oh please.
<s> I am lighten. Can we drop this?
<s> That's not fair.
<s> I think that's for the best.
<s> Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
<s> It was perfect.
<s> Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
<s> I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
<s> - none taken -
<s> Any ideas who it could be?
<s> Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
<s> Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
<s> I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
<s> Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
<s> Okay.
<s> Why?
<s> You'd do that for me?
<s> Well did you like it?
<s> How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
<s> Just taking your photo.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> I swear.
<s> I know.
<s> Same time next week?
<s> Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
<s> Honey, is something wrong?
<s> Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
<s> Jesus!
<s> Get out of here.
<s> Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
<s> Did you do everything I asked you to?
<s> You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
<s> I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
<s> Likewise I'm sure.
<s> It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
<s> I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
<s> Outstanding.
<s> In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
<s> Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
<s> Shhh.
<s> Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
<s> Cecile.
<s> Where'd she go?
<s> Kind of.
<s> It was... Fantastic.
<s> I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
<s> And that's why you're leaving?
<s> I have a flair for drama.
<s> I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
<s> Not that it's any of your business but yes.
<s> Thank you. Now, where were we?
<s> I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
<s> I hope I didn't keep you from something.
<s> It's Cecile.
<s> Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
<s> I need to talk to Annette.
<s> We played backgammon?
<s> Eight o'clock. You got to go.
<s> Nope.
<s> I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
<s> No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
<s> How?
<s> I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
<s> Do you know the people?
<s> I got my wish anyway.
<s> I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
<s> It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
<s> Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
<s> All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
<s> I think I should.  3000W?
<s> But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
<s> I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
<s> Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
<s> No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
<s> Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
<s> I live right here.
<s> And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> I'll show you.
<s> It's true.
<s> Daddy, it's true.
<s> Voices from an old dark house!
<s> You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
<s> You called me by my name.
<s> I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
<s> Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
<s> Yes, Amy.
<s> I'm trying to.
<s> But she's such a nice lady.
<s> But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
<s> Who is she?
<s> My daughter died long ago.
<s> My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
<s> Anybody could know that song.
<s> Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
<s> I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
<s> Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
<s> Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
<s> Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
<s> I've changed a lot lately.
<s> Yeah but they looked cool...
<s> Your lips look delicious.
<s> I've been working out.
<s> What else is there?
<s> Does she have PMS?
<s> No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
<s> Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
<s> So don't look in his eyes.
<s> What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
<s> They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
<s> Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
<s> Did I kill him? Of course not!
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
<s> My vision got worse again.
<s> Rule one: always wear make-up.
<s> Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
<s> I think he called you beautiful.
<s> I still thought it was a purse.
<s> It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
<s> There is a man's arm in my bed.
<s> Tuesday. Are you okay?
<s> And he was missing an arm.
<s> Did you get rid of Mark?
<s> Why not? There's been a murder.
<s> Hide him.
<s> You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
<s> Frida? You okay?
<s> Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
<s> Knock what off?
<s> Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
<s> Yeah right... You better go.
<s> On your desk.
<s> Yes, that's what we're looking for.
<s> No really, I love knowing what people read.
<s> I can forgive you a bestseller.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
<s> Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
<s> Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
<s> No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
<s> Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
<s> No, I got it. It's okay.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
<s> Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
<s> Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
<s> I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
<s> How big?
<s> She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
<s> We can just take this pillowcase.
<s> Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
<s> I told you she was innocent.
<s> She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
<s> It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
<s> Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
<s> The other one?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> I see...
<s> Patricia Crenshaw.
<s> Good.
<s> Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
<s> Why, yes.
<s> Shut-up.
<s> What?
<s> I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
<s> A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
<s> You know something about me?
<s> Not that again...
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> A month.
<s> Great.
<s> Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
<s> It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
<s> Great.
<s> I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
<s> I can't believe he'd do this.
<s> ... What?
<s> Up and around?  Soon?
<s> What about her.
<s> We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
<s> You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
<s> I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
<s> I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
<s> Bob...
<s> ... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
<s> It's fine.
<s> The government
<s> Oh, yeah... probably...
<s> I'm not sure... I might have.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> What?
<s> We vetoed that?
<s> Wrong...
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> I can't say.
<s> I'm outta here.
<s> I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
<s> Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
<s> Just wait.
<s> You find people jobs?
<s> It was inspirational.
<s> I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
<s> What?
<s> Hi.
<s> I know.
<s> Yeah... It could be fun.
<s> Leave him.
<s> No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
<s> I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
<s> That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
<s> We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
<s> That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
<s> You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
<s> We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
<s> Come on. Let's go.
<s> Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
<s> PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
<s> Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
<s> In the battle, sir.
<s> I'm alright. Let's go.
<s> Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
<s> Well?
<s> And English, and trig
<s> How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
<s> So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
<s> Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
<s> And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
<s> Doing fine, sir.
<s> Yes... sir.
<s> It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
<s> Sure.
<s> It's Nuwanda.
<s> Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
<s> They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
<s> I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
<s> What good will that do?
<s> But, Chris...
<s> You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
<s> Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
<s> Dead Poets honor.
<s> My Word
<s> Carpe Diem... seize the day.
<s> Meeks.
<s> Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
<s> I didn't know you taught.
<s> Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
<s> Yawp!
<s> I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
<s> Then you can help him.
<s> Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
<s> Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
<s> But different.
<s> Where is this cave he's talking about?
<s> That's miles.
<s> Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
<s> So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
<s> Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
<s> Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
<s> No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
<s> Yea, art thou there?
<s> We have to make it to the third deck...
<s> I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
<s> I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
<s> Dead.
<s> I saved your life is what I did!
<s> The thieves.
<s> Jesus Christ lady...
<s> ...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
<s> Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
<s> That's what I do.
<s> You're saying they can think?
<s> The quiet...
<s> You should talk...
<s> I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
<s> That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
<s> I don't know...you got what we need?
<s> Line it up now, nice and easy...
<s> Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
<s> Joey...
<s> Poolside?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Hey! Come out here!
<s> Shut up!
<s> John...
<s> She fucked me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Good... Pass the beer.
<s> Get the boots.
<s> Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
<s> Hey! Fuckin' A!
<s> What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
<s> I know, but...
<s> Couple of weeks... Listen --
<s> Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
<s> Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
<s> Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
<s> I came to see Merle.
<s> Linda, yeah.
<s> Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
<s> Oh. Fine.
<s> Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
<s> Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
<s> No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
<s> Sal's alive???
<s> She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
<s> I... No. You do this for money?
<s> We... Three bullets.
<s> No. No, no.
<s> Merle, I wanna go home!
<s> Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
<s> There's Vince!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Huh?
<s> Hunt with Vince?
<s> Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
<s> I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
<s> Nick!... I thought you went home.
<s> Watch it, shithead!
<s> What do you mean, no???
<s> There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
<s> Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
<s> Phantom Mary?
<s> One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
<s> They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
<s> Technothugs?
<s> Fuck you - fuck you.
<s> Your mother.
<s> I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
<s> He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
<s> I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
<s> Out of the room.
<s> I'm not voting for you.
<s> Remember my promise.
<s> Where?
<s> That wasn't your plan, was it?
<s> Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
<s> You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
<s> It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
<s> NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
<s> Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
<s> Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
<s> There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
<s> You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
<s> GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
<s> I was set up.
<s> 'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
<s> This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
<s> I'll be okay.
<s> We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
<s> With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
<s> No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
<s> No, sir.
<s> <u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
<s> How ya feeling?
<s> We're partners, aren't we?
<s> ...What are you talking about...?
<s> This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
<s> That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
<s> Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
<s> If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
<s> He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
<s> Good to know you, Willy.
<s> Hi.
<s> We will --
<s> They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
<s> I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
<s> It hasn't opened yet?
<s> Young man -- you got me there.
<s> Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
<s> All right, darling.
<s> That's just too bad --
<s> I did not, Grandma.
<s> Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
<s> That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
<s> No, Stone!
<s> What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
<s> You are afraid!
<s> I do -- and I think you should too.
<s> Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
<s> Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
<s> That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
<s> Well, I'll be -- 
<s> But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
<s> Thank you, Mr. Webster.
<s> There's no joy in it for me.
<s> Shall we?
<s> Morning, Jabez.
<s> Headache -- Squire?
<s> Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
<s> You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
<s> Oh, Jabez.
<s> Who is it?
<s> Jabez ...
<s> Looks right elegant, Mary.
<s> Tired?
<s> Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
<s> Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
<s> Mary!
<s> Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
<s> And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
<s> Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
<s> Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
<s> Mary -- Jabez --
<s> Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
<s> Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
<s> Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
<s> Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
<s> You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
<s> Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
<s> You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
<s> She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
<s> If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
<s> Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
<s> Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
<s> I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
<s> Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
<s> Why don't you?
<s> Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
<s> Married.
<s> You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
<s> It's okay, it's okay.
<s> But meant her moving here.
<s> It's corny, but I could live with it.
<s> They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
<s> John.
<s> I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
<s> Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
<s> See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
<s> If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
<s> You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
<s> Okay.
<s> They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
<s> One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
<s> Then don't waste time talking to me.
<s> No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
<s> Yeah.  I remember our first date.
<s> Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
<s> The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
<s> Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
<s> I...I shot a kid.
<s> I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> What's it look like?  We're going in.
<s> Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
<s> They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
<s> Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
<s> Come on, what's under this?
<s> Heidi, I'm dying.
<s> Jackie - what are you talking about?
<s> I love you.
<s> That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
<s> You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
<s> Yeah.  So how are you?
<s> No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
<s> What trip?
<s> Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
<s> Shit...
<s> All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
<s> All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
<s> What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
<s> Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
<s> I'm not alone.
<s> Call me whatever you want.
<s> They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
<s> So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
<s> I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
<s> When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
<s> I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
<s> Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
<s> I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
<s> He's all doped up.
<s> What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
<s> Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
<s> Come on, lemme load you up...
<s> Gimme the keys to get outta here!
<s> It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
<s> What now, Sonny?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why not?
<s> No.  I had some legal training, but...
<s> What about Howard?
<s> Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
<s> Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
<s> You stopped?  Why?
<s> My body?  What for?
<s> You're serious!
<s> Fuck him - let him out!
<s> Get 'em in the vault!
<s> Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
<s> What?
<s> It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
<s> They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
<s> Okay, Sonny.
<s> I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
<s> I want them all.
<s> I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
<s> I am.
<s> What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
<s> I forgot she's in here.
<s> I said you were never a faggot.
<s> Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
<s> I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
<s> Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...

<s> He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
<s> Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
<s> Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
<s> You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
<s> Ask Sal.
<s> What was you saying?
<s> A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
<s> Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
<s> One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
<s> I didn't.
<s> We're still standing.
<s> That's it?
<s> It's gonna be hot today.
<s> Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
<s> I'm coming.
<s> Yo, I'm gone.
<s> Stop tripping.
<s> He's completely innocent.
<s> Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
<s> I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
<s> I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
<s> And move to Long Island...
<s> Twenty "C" Duracells.
<s> Mister Seor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
<s> Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
<s> Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
<s> I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
<s> Where we goin'?
<s> You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
<s> Make dat money.  Get paid.
<s> Gotta go.
<s> Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
<s> Your memory is really getting bad.
<s> A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
<s> People are free to do what they wanna do.
<s> Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
<s> That's right.
<s> Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
<s> That's what I think.
<s> It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
<s> I understand.
<s> Sez who?
<s> I love you.
<s> You listening to me?
<s> I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
<s> Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
<s> Too many pizzerias already there.
<s> 'Bout time, Pop.
<s> I'm gonna kill somebody today.
<s> Tell 'em, Pop.
<s> Don't start on me today.
<s> Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
<s> Yeah, I think.
<s> She's saying... a beautiful swan...
<s> A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
<s> We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
<s> Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
<s> Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
<s> Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
<s> Coming.
<s> Okay, what?
<s> Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
<s> It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
<s> I know I am, Mom.
<s> Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
<s> Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
<s> Cool.
<s> The second R is silent.
<s> And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
<s> Exactly! A pirate!
<s> You're not my real dad.
<s> And he invented fire.
<s> Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
<s> That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
<s> Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
<s> Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
<s> Yea!
<s> I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
<s> Some what?
<s> Just wanted to see how your doing.
<s> Hey, where did you come from?
<s> No. What happened?
<s> A blimp.
<s> Who?
<s> Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
<s> Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
<s> It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
<s> Do you know what this means?
<s> Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
<s> Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
<s> Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
<s> PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
<s> Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
<s> Right.
<s> That's gross.
<s> Not to expect you tonight.
<s> Special Needs class.
<s> This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
<s> Do you want me to pet your head?
<s> Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
<s> So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
<s> This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
<s> Skateboard.
<s> Thanks, Pop.
<s> People! Come on. "Parade" float.
<s> He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
<s> I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
<s> Yes you are. 
<s> Yes!
<s> Wow, you are smart.
<s> Well I've got a little surprise for you.
<s> The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
<s> The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
<s> Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
<s> Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
<s> Basically...
<s> It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
<s> That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
<s> Would you really have drawn my blood?
<s> They said you were dead.  They said...
<s> Your Reverence.
<s> You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
<s> Yes...
<s> You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
<s> No one. It... seemed the proper way.
<s> You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
<s> Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
<s> Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
<s> SILENCE... SILENCE.
<s> You feel the flesh crisping?
<s> Where?
<s> Did they try and fail?
<s> Those sounds could be imitated.
<s> No.  I never drink -- wine.
<s> Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
<s> I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
<s> Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
<s> Hey Bela, how do you do that?
<s> Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
<s> Who do I play?
<s> I didn't feel well...
<s> Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
<s> "Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
<s> That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
<s> Eddie, you screwed up.
<s> You'll be fighting with the octopus.
<s> I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
<s> Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
<s> I was thinking about killing myself.
<s> It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
<s> I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
<s> I don't know.  Where?
<s> Don't you want a second take, for protection?
<s> This is the big moment...!
<s> Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
<s> This is kind of a stream--
<s> And who may you be?
<s> I made it up.  It's horseshit!
<s> Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
<s> Isn't he?
<s> Ed, it was only one review.
<s> Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
<s> Better than not getting a job?
<s> Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
<s> Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
<s> But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
<s> I told you this was gonna happen.
<s> That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
<s> You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
<s> I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
<s> Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
<s> Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
<s> Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<s> Just, it doesn't look like very much.
<s> "Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
<s> That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
<s> Tor!
<s> Mm, not good-lookink enough.
<s> I like.  When do movie shoot?
<s> Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
<s> We're escaping!
<s> Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
<s> Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
<s> Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
<s> Um, I guess --
<s> Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
<s> You can't talk that way about my movie.
<s> Oh.  Congratulations.
<s> Not good...
<s> Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
<s> Uh, atomic energy?
<s> The sun.
<s> Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
<s> No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
<s> What's uncanny?
<s> Mr. Wood!
<s> Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
<s> And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
<s> Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
<s> Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
<s> You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
<s> Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
<s> No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
<s> Who?
<s> What if--you're vomiting?
<s> Do they show it?
<s> Yeah. Ma...
<s> Yeah, so... ?
<s> I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
<s> Went --
<s> I'm moving out.
<s> You're nuts.
<s> What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
<s> What?
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Um, yeah -- thanks.
<s> A woman wants to be pursued.
<s> That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
<s> You said a woman likes to be pursued.
<s> Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
<s> Yes?
<s> Thank you. Can I see her?
<s> Mm...  Oh, man...
<s> What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
<s> Really? They were..
<s> Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
<s> Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
<s> So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
<s> Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
<s> Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
<s> When? Today?
<s> Right, right...
<s> Yeah?
<s> Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
<s> I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
<s> Oh my God!!
<s> So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
<s> Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
<s> It was horrible. He called me up.
<s> Why? How...
<s> Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
<s> It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
<s> You batted or you bunted?
<s> Well, then I'm quitting.
<s> Welcome to work, Ed.
<s> I hear the dog really liked him.
<s> I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
<s> Okay ...
<s> Well, when you put it that way.
<s> Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
<s> Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
<s> Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
<s> No. It's your fault.
<s> No... Could you?
<s> What?
<s> It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
<s> What?
<s> What are you drunk?
<s> No. What happened?
<s> Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> What's the dif --
<s> We'd better go...
<s> It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
<s> No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
<s> Please!
<s> Yeah.
<s> No. Am I supposed to?
<s> It's Ed.
<s> Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
<s> What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
<s> If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
<s> Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
<s> Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
<s> I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
<s> He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
<s> You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
<s> What kind of person?
<s> Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
<s> Yeah, uh, just a minute
<s> What?
<s> Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
<s> Okay.  Yeah.  We know
<s> See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
<s> But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
<s> Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
<s> Ethics are...
<s> Should be easy.  So far no competition.
<s> Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
<s> Good luck, Tracy.
<s> So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
<s> Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
<s> I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
<s> Looks like today's your lucky day
<s> That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
<s> That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes?
<s> Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
<s> Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
<s> Uh, Jim?
<s> Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
<s> I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
<s> Here?
<s> Okay.  Give me the drill.
<s> Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
<s> We'll let it run awhile
<s> Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
<s> Three twenty-five.
<s> Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
<s> Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
<s> Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
<s> I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
<s> Larry, you just take it easy
<s> I'm not like you.
<s> What?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Good luck to you too, Paul.
<s> Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
<s> Paul, get out!
<s> What'd I do?
<s> Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
<s> Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Till 19-fucking-70.
<s> It's practically stamped on your forehead.
<s> No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
<s> Yes.  But do you know?
<s> He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
<s> Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
<s> That simple, huh?
<s> Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
<s> He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
<s> No.  Now.  You fucked him.
<s> Call me Dudley.
<s> Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
<s> How'd you get them to retract?
<s> Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
<s> First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
<s> Lynn.
<s> Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
<s> The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
<s> For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
<s> Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
<s> I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
<s> I'm not asking you.
<s> I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
<s> You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
<s> Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
<s> I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
<s> Wait.  Our deal still holds?
<s> I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
<s> Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
<s> It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Say what and so what.
<s> You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
<s> Nobody.  At least not yet.
<s> Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
<s> Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
<s> Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
<s> Yes, Dudley.  I am.
<s> I'll break them, sir.
<s> She may still be alive, whoever she is.
<s> There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
<s> And now you'll provide them.
<s> <u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
<s> <u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
<s> Give me a minute, will ya?
<s> I want to do it right.
<s> Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
<s> Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
<s> Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
<s> He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
<s> Why?
<s> You're the first person to ever call me tough.
<s> None.  Call it a hunch.
<s> Under the house.
<s> No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
<s> Yeah, it's subtle.
<s> What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
<s> What's he doing here, Sid?
<s> You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
<s> This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
<s> Please hold, Sergeant...
<s> You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
<s> Yes.
<s> Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
<s> Who are you calling?!
<s> I don't know what that means.
<s> So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
<s> Really?
<s> Who was that other guy?
<s> What do they have to do with this?
<s> The NSA?
<s> You're crazy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
<s> If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
<s> Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
<s> Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
<s> Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
<s> I called my wife!
<s> How'd you have the manpower to--
<s> Those are Feds.
<s> Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
<s> Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
<s> So what do we do now?
<s> Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
<s> The thing is...it really can't wait.
<s> A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
<s> Are you sure about this?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
<s> I'm married.
<s> Yes. I have her permission.
<s> Eight.  Size eight.
<s> <u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
<s> Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
<s> The robbery.
<s> <u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
<s> This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
<s> Not a very good one, but--
<s> Right.
<s> A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
<s> It's okay.
<s> I know.
<s> I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
<s> Stacy--
<s> You opened the thing?
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's over.
<s> Albert's gonna get me my job back.
<s> Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
<s> I don't believe it is, no.
<s> That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
<s> I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
<s> I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
<s> You got a minute?
<s> Who's doing this?
<s> Will you hang on just a second.
<s> How?
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
<s> Brill.
<s> This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
<s> You're firing me.
<s> Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
<s> Mr. Dean--
<s> What are you talking--
<s> Why?
<s> Dad!
<s> Do I know you?
<s> Table 122?
<s> Bobby--
<s> Bobby--
<s> Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
<s> I said fuck you.
<s> You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
<s> We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
<s> We found the originals.
<s> Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
<s> So they know everything.
<s> Oh, let's assume that they have.
<s> Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
<s> No.
<s> What kind of fossils?
<s> I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
<s> Hello!  Good morning.
<s> Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
<s> I don't want to go back.
<s> I don't care to bargain.
<s> I do not.
<s> Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
<s> Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
<s> A lie.  What do you hate most?
<s> No.
<s> I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
<s> Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
<s> Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
<s> Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
<s> Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
<s> You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
<s> It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
<s> I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
<s> I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
<s> I liberated it.
<s> No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
<s> She can take you as far as Florence.
<s> Moose.
<s> Very true!
<s> I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
<s> The rest meant nothing to me.
<s> Off with his head!
<s> Darling, for goodness' sake!
<s> But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
<s> What?
<s> Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I can already see.
<s> Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
<s> He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
<s> Never heard of it.
<s> I'm not sewing anything else.
<s> The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
<s> Yes, for your hair.
<s> I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
<s> You loved him.
<s> I'll always go back to that church.
<s> It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
<s> I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
<s> Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
<s> I had a hotel room.
<s> I'm feeling old.
<s> I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
<s> Go away.
<s> I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
<s> Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
<s> I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
<s> So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
<s> What's he saying?
<s> This was your garden?
<s> Then you were married?
<s> I don't recall asking your permission.
<s> He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
<s> Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
<s> Why didn't I think of that?
<s> This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
<s> I'm in the middle.
<s> I'm going to get him, I promise you.
<s> It's sold.
<s> You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
<s> It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
<s> You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
<s> Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
<s> I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
<s> So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
<s> Possibly.
<s> Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
<s> Give him the card.
<s> I'm not the one to ask...
<s> Certainly not mine. Come on.
<s> That's because I wanted them to!
<s> Let's just see how we do.
<s> It was a long time ago.
<s> Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
<s> Little celebration before we set off.
<s> To our...partnership.
<s> I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
<s> These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
<s> Behind you.
<s> It's your mistake.
<s> Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
<s> I'd taken the Mask?
<s> A parting gift from the Empire.
<s> Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
<s> We're doing it tonight.
<s> Feeling old?
<s> Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
<s> What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
<s> China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
<s> The disc is still in there.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
<s> That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
<s> This is big enough.
<s> Because I never assume anything.
<s> I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
<s> The early bird gets the damn worm.
<s> Suspicious, after all these years?
<s> Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
<s> Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
<s> What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
<s> In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
<s> What do you think?  What's this?
<s> Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
<s> Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
<s> Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
<s> She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
<s> Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
<s> They did?
<s> The what?
<s> I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
<s> Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
<s> I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
<s> Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
<s> A number for the whole group, or for us?
<s> Five million dollars.
<s> It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
<s> I told you the questions might get a little personal --
<s> You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
<s> You said things would be fine, and they're not.
<s> I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
<s> I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
<s> Don't bother.
<s> I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
<s> Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
<s> You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
<s> It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
<s> The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
<s> Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
<s> And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
<s> Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
<s> PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
<s> You didn't care about my case?
<s> Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
<s> From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
<s> What?  Who?
<s> Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
<s> Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
<s> Erin, it's just a meeting.
<s> Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
<s> "I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
<s> Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
<s> Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
<s> Nope.  Maiden.
<s> Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
<s> So did I.
<s> In the conference --
<s> Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
<s> Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
<s> That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
<s> You got more than one?
<s> I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
<s> Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
<s> Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
<s> I'm gonna clean it up.
<s> Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
<s> No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> I need it.
<s> I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
<s> Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
<s> I'm real sorry, Laura.
<s> What's going on?
<s> You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
<s> What?
<s> My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
<s> Next week.
<s> Yes?
<s> No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
<s> This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
<s> We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
<s> Barks his right on!
<s> Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
<s> Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
<s> Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
<s> You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
<s> Then I'll see you in Hell.
<s> Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
<s> You said you were going to stay. What happened?
<s> Han, we need you here.
<s> What was it?
<s> I'm against that.
<s> Now you're making sense.
<s> Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
<s> Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
<s> You're going to attack them?!!!
<s> The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
<s> Here ... near the Anoat system.
<s> I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
<s> Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
<s> Yeah, you're a real hero.
<s> You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
<s> You may call me Leia.
<s> Not really.
<s> We have no use for your kind.
<s> You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
<s> Luke needs help.  We must go back.
<s> It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
<s> We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
<s> I thought you knew this person.
<s> I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
<s> No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
<s> No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
<s> The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
<s> Only what you take with you.
<s> Free your mind and return he will.
<s> Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
<s> Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
<s> Time will tell.
<s> No! .... Never ....
<s> The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
<s> They suggested oranges.
<s> They're...pretending to dress.
<s> They look pretty docile.
<s> I'm a psychiatrist.
<s> Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
<s> Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
<s> Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
<s> You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
<s> Where's Plissken?
<s> We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
<s> What's in it for me?
<s> I see your point. What's the favor?
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
<s> No.
<s> Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
<s> I'm here.
<s> Does he know how to activate it?
<s> Delgado?
<s> Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
<s> Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
<s> Don't like it, don't come.
<s> If he lets you get close enough.
<s> Which way?
<s> They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
<s> I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
<s> Find Cuervo Jones.
<s> Who?
<s> I cannot--
<s> I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
<s> So be it, to the death.
<s> Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
<s> Of Merlin?
<s> 'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
<s> Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
<s> In the great book.
<s> The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
<s> Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
<s> That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
<s> I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
<s> So be it.
<s> We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
<s> Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
<s> I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
<s> Twenty days!? The world is that big?
<s> I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
<s> Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
<s> --I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
<s> Well what's wrong?
<s> Thank you your excellency.
<s> In here!
<s> No kidding.
<s> Maybe the circuit is busy?
<s> Me too.
<s> No. Not at all,
<s> Want to ask him?
<s> Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
<s> What's her name?
<s> Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
<s> Karl!!
<s> No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
<s> Depression?
<s> What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
<s> Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
<s> Yes am.
<s> No.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
<s> But how?
<s> Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
<s> Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
<s> No.
<s> Please.
<s> What's the difference?
<s> Father?
<s> No you don't. I do it all the time.
<s> No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
<s> What?
<s> Well I heard differently.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Okay.
<s> Honey it's to help you.
<s> So something please Doctor, Help her!
<s> So what's wrong with her?
<s> So what's next?
<s> Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
<s> No.
<s> If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
<s> You and us.
<s> Uoy era ohw.
<s> Uoy era ohw.
<s> How's your leg?
<s> Amen
<s> Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
<s> I once did a paper on it
<s> Yeah, a fall.
<s> Unlikely.
<s> You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
<s> Sick priest, is that it?
<s> Very much.
<s> I've seen it.
<s> Be silent!
<s> Bastards! Stop!
<s> You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
<s> Yes?
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Why not?
<s> You wanted to see me, Charlie?
<s> We don't need you, Frankie.
<s> It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
<s> You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
<s> They're falling out.
<s> No bones?
<s> The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
<s> Two at a time?
<s> Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
<s> Two nights.
<s> You look like you just crawled out of bed.
<s> Lotta water.
<s> Huh?
<s> Fuck him.
<s> Fuck him.
<s> They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
<s> Try the black Knable.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Funny.  Strike a bell?
<s> So do I.
<s> Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
<s> I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
<s> I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
<s> I was just thinking what Ma would think.
<s> I didn't get her number.
<s> I'll drop the eighths.
<s> It's early.
<s> Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
<s> It's not gonna hurt you.
<s> I told you I was gonna hit you.
<s> How about these?
<s> Yeah.  Something.
<s> First night?
<s> We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
<s> It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
<s> Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
<s> No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
<s> I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
<s> It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
<s> What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
<s> No. Why?
<s> She's a big girl.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> How come I didn't hear anything?
<s> Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
<s> Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
<s> I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
<s> You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
<s> No.
<s> Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
<s> Shut up, Frank.
<s> No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
<s> Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
<s> Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Spur of the moment.
<s> Thrilling.  Both of you.
<s> All right.
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> It's one of Jack's favorites.
<s> We're finished.
<s> You're an hour and a half late.
<s> Miss --
<s> Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
<s> Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
<s> Hey!
<s> You can buy new ones tomorrow.
<s> So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
<s> For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
<s> First times. Hey, look at this.
<s> Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
<s> I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
<s> Smells like tuna number two to me.
<s> As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
<s> No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
<s> Huh?
<s> I just saw a man walk out of your room.
<s> Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
<s> Yes, well, they are.
<s> I'll call you.
<s> For a while.  She left.
<s> I suppose.
<s> He'll come around.
<s> Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
<s> Nothing personal --
<s> In and out.
<s> Like a baby. You?
<s> No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
<s> Hey, business is business.
<s> Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
<s> Better than that.
<s> Nothing.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Who's Nina?
<s> No kidding?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Coffee?
<s> Look, if you want to leave...
<s> Huh?
<s> Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
<s> Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
<s> Another five years, huh?
<s> It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
<s> What are they?
<s> Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
<s> I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
<s> Wow.
<s> Huh? Oh, no.
<s> Eddie.
<s> They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
<s> Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
<s> Yeah -- me.
<s> Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
<s> Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
<s> How old is he?
<s> He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
<s> You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
<s> So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
<s> You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
<s> After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
<s> And you wouldn't be.
<s> One last time.  It's important ...
<s> Don't hang up ...
<s> -- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
<s> Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
<s> No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
<s> Would it?
<s> Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
<s> He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
<s> You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
<s> Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
<s> Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
<s> Pollux is -- what?
<s> What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
<s> You mean like ... condoms?
<s> Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
<s> Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
<s> Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
<s> You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
<s> No problem.
<s> What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
<s> What do you know about it?
<s> Have fun at work.
<s> Don't I usually kiss my wife?
<s> Great.
<s> You?  Married?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
<s> You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
<s> I don't know.  Maybe...
<s> But I think I like you better this way...
<s> Youre jumping, sweetheart...
<s> Sure.
<s> Mary Had A Little Lamb.
<s> Its just two kids, right?
<s> I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
<s> So could you write down her exact address?
<s> Hey, is that really necessary?
<s> Its me, Jack...
<s> Ive got all the time in the world...
<s> I call all you white guys "Jack."
<s> I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
<s> I've got everything I need.
<s> You still think this is about me, don't you?
<s> What?!
<s> Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
<s> I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
<s> How much time?!
<s> Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
<s> Do I look like I live in a bottle?
<s> Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
<s> Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
<s> Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
<s> Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
<s> Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
<s> Okay, chief.
<s> Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
<s> What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
<s> I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
<s> I was in the city.
<s> Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
<s> Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
<s> And...?
<s> Really.
<s> I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
<s> Sure.  I really like Annie.
<s> You had a heart attack?
<s> I want it...
<s> No, open it...
<s> What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
<s> But Im gettin close, right?
<s> Worse, you mean...
<s> But you always seem so certain.
<s> I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
<s> Are you okay, Jack?
<s> Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
<s> What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
<s> That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
<s> Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
<s> Do I know you?
<s> But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
<s> Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
<s> Merry Christmas...
<s> Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
<s> I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
<s> Five times.
<s> <u>Should</u>?
<s> Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
<s> I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
<s> Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
<s> Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
<s> Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
<s> Put your tiny little mind at ease.
<s> They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
<s> Give me the god damn mirror!
<s> Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
<s> I'm worried about you.
<s> The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
<s> It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
<s> It's easy for you to be patient.
<s> Victor must've taken him.
<s> What do you mean "complete"?
<s> The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
<s> You've been working out.
<s> What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
<s> I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
<s> Last one down springs for room service.
<s> Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
<s> Johnny.
<s> Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
<s> Showtime.
<s> It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
<s> Reed, we're running out of time.
<s> It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<s> Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
<s> I was talking about us.  Working together.
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> What?  What do you mean you --
<s> No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
<s> Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
<s> I gave him twenty.
<s> I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
<s> A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
<s> Raising the shields.
<s> Victor, are you feeling alright?
<s> No...
<s> The less time, the better.
<s> That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
<s> Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
<s> The Other Side got to him.
<s> What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
<s> Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
<s> And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
<s> We'll know -- in the next breath...
<s> No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
<s> Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
<s> I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
<s> We're pushing oxygen today.
<s> I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
<s> But I did. I'm positive!
<s> I have no idea.
<s> I feel much better now...
<s> Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
<s> Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
<s> All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
<s> As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
<s> The Breath of God...
<s> What about Dr. Michaels?
<s> How are you, Miss Peterson?
<s> Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
<s> If there's any chance --
<s> It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
<s> Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
<s> Well, we better get on with it.
<s> They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
<s> Send the following message...
<s> Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
<s> They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
<s> Enough to breathe, but that's all.
<s> Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
<s> The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
<s> On the Repeater.
<s> Looks simple to operate.
<s> I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
<s> I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
<s> Unghh... oh, geez...
<s> Certainly -
<s> Certainly.
<s> Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
<s> What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
<s> I did.
<s> Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
<s> HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
<s> No, that's not it, Jerry.
<s> Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
<s> Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
<s> I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
<s> Personal matters.
<s> Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
<s> GOT IT?
<s> One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
<s> End a April.
<s> I unnerstand.
<s> Ya got that right.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yah!
<s> Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
<s> Ya kiddin'!
<s> Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
<s> No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
<s> ...Babe the Blue Ox?
<s> Yah, I see.
<s> Ma'am, I answered your question.
<s> Sir? Right now?
<s> No, no, fax is -
<s> Good day, sir.
<s> Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
<s> Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
<s> I know it's a lot.
<s> Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
<s> 2:30.
<s> Yah.
<s> Well, they -
<s> No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
<s> Nope.
<s> Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
<s> Yah?
<s> Yah...
<s> Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
<s> No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
<s> That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
<s> Just a Diet Coke.
<s> I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I always liked ya so much...
<s> Nope.
<s> Yah, is this Marge?
<s> Margie Olmstead?
<s> This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
<s> Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
<s> His wife?
<s> - looking.
<s> Still missing. We're looking.
<s> Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
<s> Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
<s> I love you, Norm.
<s> And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
<s> I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
<s> ...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
<s> It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
<s> You need to make these your primary "action items."
<s> Some of it, yes.
<s> Does this sound strange to you?
<s> Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
<s> Can't you give me something?
<s> You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
<s> Practicing what?
<s> I'll expose you.
<s> Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
<s> What... ?
<s> Please.
<s> Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
<s> Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
<s> I could check your prostate.
<s> Well... thanks, anyway.
<s> Answer the question!
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> I'm sorry, but I...
<s> Who's this?
<s> Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
<s> Pardon me?
<s> ...no ...no ...
<s> Delivered from Swedish furniture.
<s> The things you own, they end up owning you.
<s> I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
<s> It affords him other interesting opportunities.
<s> No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
<s> Like hell.  That counted.
<s> Strange.
<s> After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
<s> A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
<s> Hum.
<s> "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
<s> Shatner.  William Shatner.
<s> Okay.
<s> Don't mention me.
<s> Look at your hand.
<s> No, I'm not...
<s> I don't know...
<s> Fucking sweet.
<s> An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
<s> Tell him!
<s> What are you doing?!
<s> ... is over.
<s> Why do people think I'm you?
<s> You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
<s> But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
<s> This isn't possible...
<s> You... you can't be serious about this.
<s> I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
<s> Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
<s> Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
<s> What?
<s> Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
<s> Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
<s> You need me.
<s> Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
<s> You told me you'd say that, too.
<s> There is no money.
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
<s> Signs?
<s> I hope you're ready for this.
<s> What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
<s> I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
<s> Random, sure.
<s> Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
<s> I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
<s> I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
<s> Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
<s> Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
<s> Yeah, so what happened?
<s> Like what?
<s> ...My Premonition was just like his.
<s> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
<s> I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
<s> I know, Dad.
<s> I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
<s> I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
<s> I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
<s> He's not a witch.
<s> What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
<s> Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
<s> As in flannels and plaids?
<s> Thirty-nine.
<s> Most kids never have it happen.
<s> No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
<s> They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
<s> That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
<s> Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
<s> You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
<s> You saying Tod did kill himself?
<s> Design?
<s> 'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
<s> Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
<s> Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
<s> May as well go out under my own free will, right?
<s> WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
<s> That's right, buddy.
<s> No.
<s> Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
<s> Keep it down, man.  I got problems.

<s> Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
<s> American?
<s> Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
<s> I suppose you have...
<s> You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
<s> Spooks?
<s> They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
<s> Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
<s> You think you are... .
<s> How?
<s> Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
<s> It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
<s> What's the plan?
<s> Christ almighty.
<s> Colonel.
<s> Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
<s> I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
<s> This just occurred to somebody, now?
<s> But now it's free, right?
<s> Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
<s> Really?
<s> The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
<s> I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
<s> <u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
<s> Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
<s> I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
<s> Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
<s> What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
<s> ...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
<s> The moron?
<s> Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
<s> And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
<s> Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
<s> You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
<s> Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
<s> <u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
<s> I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
<s> I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
<s> She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
<s> Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
<s> It was a crime.
<s> Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
<s> Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
<s> Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
<s> <u>What</u>!?
<s> I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
<s> They work for Him.
<s> God... I'm the janitor of God.
<s> I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
<s> Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
<s> What are you doing?  Give that back!
<s> Well what am I gonna do with it?
<s> Who?
<s> Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
<s> <u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
<s> Listen, you're very nice... b...
<s> Shhh...
<s> A wig?
<s> Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
<s> Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
<s> I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
<s> Out where?
<s> Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
<s> You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
<s> You're goin' a find me dead one time.
<s> If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
<s> No.
<s> I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
<s> If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
<s> Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
<s> I don't, huh?
<s> Fill it up.
<s> Who?
<s> I didn't get it, did I?
<s> Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
<s> Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
<s> Are you talking to us?
<s> Am I on TV?
<s> That's good.
<s> Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
<s> I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
<s> No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
<s> I don't know.
<s> Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
<s> I guess you fell in the water.
<s> That's dangerous, you know.
<s> Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
<s> I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
<s> Then after that?
<s> None.
<s> Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
<s> I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
<s> Yes, that's what's important to me...
<s> I'll be back later...
<s> Yes.
<s> What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
<s> That's what I mean...
<s> For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
<s> I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
<s> Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
<s> Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
<s> I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
<s> Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
<s> Hold onto this.
<s> Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
<s> Just get the fuck outta here.
<s> I'm wit' Carlos.
<s> Hi.
<s> Um. Yeah! Shorty!
<s> Nothin'.
<s> I, umm, came to see you.
<s> Of course.
<s> You got a boyfriend?
<s> You look good.
<s> I won't let my motha cut my hair.
<s> She fucks it all up!
<s> Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
<s> If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
<s> Which one?
<s> She lives near Eddie?
<s> For real?
<s> A girl named Amanda.
<s> Positive.
<s> Your friend must be misinformed.
<s> So, then whadda ya want?
<s> Jus' from around the way.
<s> Unbelievable.
<s> Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
<s> By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
<s> Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
<s> Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
<s> I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
<s> I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
<s> Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
<s> Go ahead. Make my evening.
<s> Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
<s> Yes.
<s> But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
<s> Your aunt?
<s> Just relax....
<s> Breathe easy...
<s> Just relax.
<s> Like tonight.
<s> You don't know me.
<s> Affirmative.
<s> I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
<s> Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
<s> What?
<s> Nothing. They're still there.
<s> That's it?
<s> This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
<s> I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
<s> Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
<s> Well, I'm fully covered.
<s> Yes. Where you from, Harry?
<s> Come on in.
<s> Velma.
<s> Check.
<s> Oh, about ten days ago.
<s> Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
<s> Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
<s> Fletch, I never sold nothing.
<s> Nugent. Ted Nugent.
<s> Sure, all drifters do.
<s> Take it where?
<s> Sure.
<s> I wonder if that's his doctor.
<s> That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
<s> You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
<s> John Ultrarelamensky.
<s> You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
<s> No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
<s> God...
<s> I saved his life during the war.
<s> No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
<s> Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
<s> Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
<s> But I've seen the deed.
<s> If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
<s> I think you better sit down.
<s> Bastard.
<s> I'm calling the police. Right now.
<s> You shouldn't be here.
<s> Cabana one.
<s> Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
<s> Moved out.
<s> Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
<s> Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
<s> Irwin...
<s> Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
<s> No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
<s> Why not? Oh shit... really?
<s> What about finding the source?
<s> You were going to can me, right?
<s> I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
<s> In a minute!
<s> Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
<s> But I am...
<s> We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
<s> Thanks, I needed that.
<s> I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
<s> Right away!
<s> Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
<s> Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
<s> 'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
<s> Spooky.  I'll process her.
<s> You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
<s> No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.

<s> Yeah, let's bury her.
<s> Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
<s> How much?
<s> I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
<s> People still watch that?
<s> Hah fluck, great video, huh?
<s> Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
<s> But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
<s> There's that question...
<s> ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
<s> I'll mail you a letter, come on!
<s> Twelve pack?
<s> Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
<s> Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
<s> Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
<s> I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
<s> The case!
<s> Let me go out like a man.
<s> Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
<s> Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<s> Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
<s> Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
<s> It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> No. 
<s> Boca?
<s> Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
<s> Fuck you, Santa Claus!
<s> Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
<s> Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
<s> You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
<s> Pour moi?
<s> Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
<s> What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
<s> It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
<s> Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
<s> Fake it.
<s> He got off on six.
<s> Strike out, eh?
<s> Morning.  Sometime.
<s> Who's on him?
<s> Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
<s> Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
<s> What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
<s> Suspicion of what?
<s> He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
<s> Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
<s> I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
<s> What is that old building?
<s> Well, I think you do.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Elvis has left the building.
<s> Hey, bud.
<s> One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
<s> Wish you weren't.
<s> The future guy?
<s> Frank...
<s> Next time lets put some money on it.
<s> Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
<s> Wait...
<s> I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
<s> Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
<s> Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
<s> This afternoon?
<s> What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
<s> What?
<s> My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
<s> What's happening?
<s> I'm thirty-five years old.
<s> I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
<s> October 12, 1969.
<s> What, Johnny?  What is it?
<s> October 22, 1969.
<s> No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
<s> It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
<s> H-hi.
<s> I'm right here, Dad.
<s> He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
<s> What...
<s> Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
<s> We did it, John.  We stopped him.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Sully!  Is that you?
<s> I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
<s> Better.
<s> Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
<s> This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
<s> Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
<s> Uh, huh.
<s> Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
<s> Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
<s> Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
<s> I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
<s> You have the right to speak to an att --
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
<s> Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
<s> Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
<s> Where's Shelly?
<s> I don't know...
<s> We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
<s> I'll think of something.
<s> I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, man!
<s> Will you come with me?
<s> You go ahead...
<s> Your bed.
<s> Have you ever made love in a hammock?
<s> What?
<s> The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
<s> I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
<s> You promised you'd never ask me.
<s> It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Just keep your eyes on the road.
<s> No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
<s> Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
<s> We're gonna scare him?!
<s> Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
<s> You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
<s> Daddy, what is going on?
<s> Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
<s> It's just beginning.
<s> It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
<s> There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
<s> Nancy.
<s> But what I get scared again?
<s> All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
<s> Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
<s> No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
<s> I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
<s> You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
<s> No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
<s> I've seen it.
<s> Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
<s> -- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
<s> -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's going.
<s> 'Night, Josh.
<s> Her name's Stephanie.
<s> Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
<s> Next, you dial a number.
<s> Until I hear the truth.
<s> About what?
<s> -- Bad?!
<s> She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
<s> So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
<s> You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
<s> I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
<s> And you'll never do it again.
<s> She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
<s> I packed it. Just for us.
<s> But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
<s> Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
<s> And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
<s> And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
<s> She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
<s> But Sean said...
<s> Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
<s> What about not-so-great writers?
<s> Just felt a little chill.
<s> Yeah...a lot.
<s> There's something I haven't told you...
<s> Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
<s> I want to go home. I want off this ship.
<s> Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
<s> Just radio for help, okay???
<s> The window...
<s> Please, hurry...
<s> You are going where?
<s> What do you mean, we must abandon?
<s> That was a big mistake.
<s> No, we're not.
<s> He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
<s> The American theater doesn't need people like that.
<s> This could be it.
<s> This could be it.
<s> I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
<s> Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
<s> Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
<s> Daddy, wait.
<s> We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
<s> All right. What's been going on?
<s> How prominent?
<s> You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
<s> It violates so many trusts.
<s> I'm glad we're having this talk.
<s> Life is good.
<s> I'm at the door.
<s> Right here. At the door.
<s> It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
<s> You know the answer to that.
<s> He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
<s> Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
<s> "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
<s> I want to believe.
<s> This could be it!
<s> You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
<s> How come?
<s> To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
<s> Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
<s> I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
<s> What color?
<s> I kissed her while she was laughing.
<s> We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
<s> Not one of Steven's finer moments.
<s> Engaging.
<s> I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
<s> Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
<s> He goes to the theater armed.
<s> And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
<s> As I told you about English policemen.
<s> Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
<s> There's no room! And the air is lovely.
<s> Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
<s> I thought you were against fighting.
<s> The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
<s> I hope not.
<s> That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
<s> I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
<s> Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
<s> Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
<s> Who's leading them?
<s> Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
<s> ...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
<s> You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
<s> Er, no...
<s> I guess I'm a slow learner.
<s> No, <i>this</i> is your man.
<s> Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
<s> A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
<s> It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
<s> Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
<s> I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
<s> Thank you, no.
<s> Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
<s> You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
<s> The place is crawling with Hoovers.
<s> You know I'm scared of heights.
<s> Any particular reason?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> In a corridor.
<s> I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
<s> Michael's.
<s> You may as well invite her here.
<s> Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
<s> Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
<s> We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
<s> I hope he's not just a body.
<s> How do I square the accident?
<s> Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
<s> I've found him too.
<s> I was at home.
<s> In the South Wing.
<s> Of course.
<s> You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
<s> I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
<s> One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
<s> No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
<s> No way. I've got to get out now.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What do you mean? You've never been there.
<s> Small town, small bank, big money.
<s> I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
<s> Want to cry now?
<s> You sent me to him.
<s> What do we do?
<s> And switched keys.
<s> You bastard...
<s> I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
<s> I can handle it.
<s> You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
<s> I think you liked it with him.
<s> Yeah... I guess it does.
<s> Thanks. Hope you do too.
<s> Two boxes of double-ought buck.
<s> You were with him?
<s> I'm good at that.
<s> It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
<s> Just sandwiches...
<s> Can't leave the desk.
<s> Suit yourself.
<s> Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
<s> Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
<s> Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
<s> Just... tell us what you want.
<s> A Ford... We have a Ford.
<s> The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
<s> I'll tell you when.
<s> How?
<s> And you told Brumby?
<s> This is my brother's car.
<s> What?
<s> What name?
<s> Jack, you're wrong.
<s> Jack...
<s> Good evening.
<s> That's nice.
<s> Doreen.
<s> I must go. I'm in a hurry.
<s> He was all right to me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Once a week?
<s> He was gentlemanly. I like that.
<s> Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
<s> I work for him.
<s> Go on.
<s> No.
<s> Really?
<s> Was he?
<s> We're there now.
<s> Entertaining.
<s> What girl?
<s> Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
<s> No. It's all right.
<s> Working at Woolworths.
<s> Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
<s> Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
<s> Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
<s> Good lad.
<s> Who's Brumby?
<s> How'd you find me?
<s> Oh yes? How?
<s> Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
<s> Funny.  Can I phone London?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> No. Really, I am.
<s> No, you won't.
<s> You're lucky. They kill as well.
<s> What about Keith?
<s> Pension him off.
<s> What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
<s> You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
<s> Not much.
<s> How could I stay away?
<s> A bereavement. A death in the family.
<s> What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
<s> Can't say I do.
<s> Not till I'm dead, Eric.
<s> Sod off.
<s> Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
<s> Piss off, Ray.
<s> Three hundred altogether, Harry.
<s> Where am I going to work?
<s> I had to.
<s> Well, I think I had one once.
<s> Eh...?
<s> Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
<s> He is?
<s> I heard that they were running cold.
<s> Yes.
<s> What hard part?
<s> That's right...
<s> What?
<s> How?
<s> No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
<s> No, we're just...
<s> Talking about it as a...
<s> What did you say?
<s> You're saying "me."
<s> What?
<s> You have to steal the leads tonight?
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> Yes.
<s> What if you don't get caught?
<s> No.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
<s> Then tough luck, George, because you are.
<s> That's none of your fucking business...
<s> It's a waste of time.
<s> They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
<s> ...what am I going to do all month...
<s> Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
<s> No.
<s> Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
<s> Thank you, George.
<s> Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
<s> Who are you?
<s> Levene!!
<s> And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
<s> What two?
<s> ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
<s> Roma.
<s> Not lately it isn't.
<s> It isn't me...
<s> Murray said...
<s> I can't do it, Shel.
<s> What if you don't close...?
<s> Not lately you can't...
<s> Now.  Yes...When?
<s> I can't split them.
<s> Because I say so.
<s> That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
<s> It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
<s> It's not impossible.
<s> Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
<s> I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
<s> What sales?
<s> You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
<s> You sold eight Mountain View?
<s> Last night, this morning.
<s> Mmm.
<s> "You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
<s> From the store.
<s> What is it?
<s> I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
<s> Well, we'll do that this weekend.
<s> Uh...
<s> No, his wife is.
<s> Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
<s> Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
<s> Kenilworth...?
<s> One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
<s> She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
<s> But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
<s> I'm not.
<s> Yest...
<s> I don't know.
<s> The check wasn't cashed?
<s> Tell me again.  Your wife.
<s> She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
<s> It's nothing.
<s> What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
<s> You going to turn State's?
<s> Fuck the Machine.
<s> Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
<s> I'm going home.
<s> Yes.
<s> To do business.
<s> At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
<s> We have no money for a rug.
<s> Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
<s>  You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
<s>  He's going to kill Fanucci.
<s> I saw him with you.
<s> You're not my father!
<s> Because I need MONEY!
<s> I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
<s>  You must understand, this is all new to me...
<s> Let's go.
<s> Mio fratello.
<s> We're making an investment in Havana.
<s> I want you to help me, Fredo.
<s> You know otherwise, Freddie?
<s> You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
<s> We have time.
<s> And you believed that story.
<s> I've always taken care of you.
<s> Beautiful.
<s> What?
<s> In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
<s>  And he agreed?
<s> I'm supposed to stay in my house.
<s> I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
<s> Am I a prisoner?
<s> Kay... Kay...
<s> Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
<s> If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
<s> She's gone, Tom.
<s> I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
<s> I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
<s> Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
<s> The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
<s> I don't know.
<s> That plane goes to Miami...
<s> Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
<s> Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
<s> I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
<s> I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
<s> He's going to try Panama...
<s> He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
<s> You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
<s> Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
<s> Yes, Michael, it does.
<s> I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
<s> In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
<s> Get out of my hotel.
<s> Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
<s> I wouldn't consider anyone else.
<s> You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
<s> Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
<s> There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
<s> Let him gamble.
<s> That is a complete falsehood.
<s> Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
<s> Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
<s> In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
<s> Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
<s> Keep them alive.
<s> And?
<s> No, she's here.
<s> We worked it all out beforehand.
<s> You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
<s> My lawyer went over this beforehand.
<s> Maybe, yes... maybe no.
<s> I won't keep you another minute...
<s> I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
<s> Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
<s> If you enjoy it, you should do it.
<s> No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
<s> Your wife?
<s> Of course.  I am married still.
<s> No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
<s> A homo?
<s> He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
<s> I stink to high heaven right now.
<s> You mean, like posed for pictures?
<s> But why?
<s> But it's just my face you want to draw.
<s> What?
<s> Go ahead.
<s> This David's a friend?
<s> Did you now?
<s> Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
<s> Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
<s> I don't like to talk about that.
<s> Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
<s> You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
<s> No, I -- you're a homosexual.
<s> You don't think of me that way, do you?
<s> You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
<s> What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
<s> But we have to match the other sketch.
<s> Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
<s> I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
<s> Not me.
<s> You were a soldier?
<s> Something happened to him?
<s> You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
<s> Do I look okay?
<s> I don't hear anything.
<s> Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
<s> Good.  Let's get dry.
<s> The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
<s> I thought you'd given up on my picture.
<s> Never gave it much thought.
<s> A very lucky thing indeed.
<s> I'm very sorry.
<s> That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
<s> "A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
<s> You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
<s> What won't do?
<s> What was that?
<s> No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
<s> Oh Clayton.
<s> Fuck off!
<s> I think I'll hang around.
<s> I just want to watch it, okay?
<s> The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
<s> I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
<s> It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
<s> Yes.  Perfectly.
<s> Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
<s> Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
<s> But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
<s> Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
<s> Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
<s> She is beautiful.
<s> Of course.  This afternoon.
<s> I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
<s> I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
<s> Sure.
<s> Everything.  Start at the beginning.
<s> Your father was a schoolmaster?
<s> Quite.
<s> A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
<s> I guess.
<s> I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
<s> Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
<s> Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
<s> About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
<s> Tell me about Kip -
<s> A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
<s> I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
<s> Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
<s> Let them go --
<s> You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
<s> Get out of here, then. Now.
<s> Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
<s> Cadillac.
<s> The other day....
<s> It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
<s> Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
<s> Gray.
<s> Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
<s> I know. Weird, huh -- ?
<s> And there she is --
<s> It's arright ...
<s> That's a good one, Donny...
<s> Every day. I wonder about that every day...
<s> We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
<s> I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
<s> You've been pre-booked...
<s> "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
<s> Yeah... You want a ride...
<s> What am I supposed to do?
<s> Hello, Memphis --
<s> You, too
<s> Yeah --
<s> Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
<s> About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
<s> Me...
<s> I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
<s> The family that steals together, deals together...
<s> I don't know. What -- ?
<s> I know ...
<s> No problem -
<s> Run it...
<s> For real?
<s> It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
<s> Mitch.
<s> No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
<s> On account of me.
<s> No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
<s> Deodorant.
<s> Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
<s> I bet you say that to all the girls...
<s> Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
<s> It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
<s> The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
<s> No we don't -
<s> Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
<s> So she flies -
<s> No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
<s> Look at Jeannie's kid.
<s> Billy, how are you?
<s> Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
<s> But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
<s> You treated me like shit.
<s> Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
<s> Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
<s> Liar!
<s> I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
<s> What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> It'll be okay.
<s> But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
<s> What did he say, exactly?
<s> Paul will calm down. You'll see.
<s> Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
<s> Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
<s> Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Will you stop.
<s> I can't make any more deliveries.
<s> My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
<s> I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
<s> He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
<s> Tommy  ...
<s> No, no. It's okay.
<s> Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
<s> He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
<s> He's with his friends.
<s> But, Paulie, please.
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
<s> Why not?
<s> Week after I'm twenty-one.
<s> Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
<s> You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
<s> This is your house, right?
<s> Yeah, it is.
<s> --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
<s> And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
<s> So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
<s> Yah, all right...
<s> Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
<s> Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
<s> It's touching me.
<s> Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
<s> Fuck do you want?
<s> Of course.
<s> Half-red, half-black--
<s> --Half-red, half-black--
<s> Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
<s> C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
<s> I'm pretty sure it's right.
<s> I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
<s> The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
<s> Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
<s> It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
<s> Hey, how you doin'?
<s> Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's Saturday.
<s> Find out what?
<s> No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
<s> Good to see you.
<s> This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
<s> --That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
<s> That would be fine.
<s> I think so.
<s> Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
<s> "Undermine?"
<s> --And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
<s> --I don't have any anger at you--
<s> That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
<s> I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
<s> You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
<s> Hold up.
<s> Had one, now I'm fucked again.
<s> Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
<s> --you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
<s> Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
<s> Will, your not getting off that easy.
<s> What did you think?
<s> The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
<s> You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
<s> --Well, maybe that means you.
<s> That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
<s> I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
<s> You've never been on a plane.
<s> Yeah, I went on a date last week.
<s> Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
<s> I gave that up when my wife got sick.
<s> Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
<s> Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
<s> You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
<s> I guess.
<s> Not to me, they're not.
<s> I didn't want the job.
<s> I didn't ask for this.
<s> That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
<s> You're Welcome, Will.
<s> It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
<s> You know, nothing special.
<s> Well...
<s> If you bring the caramels.
<s> I'm supposed to understand this.
<s> They don't come over here that much.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> It's important that I learn this.
<s> Clearly.
<s> --But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
<s> What?
<s> How do you know that?
<s> 'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
<s> What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
<s> --Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
<s> You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
<s> What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
<s> Joe!
<s> Watch me pass that Chevvy.
<s> You're *ticklin' me!*
<s> Now I can't breathe.
<s> We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
<s> Okay. Go on.
<s> Four.
<s> Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
<s> But--but how we gonna eat?
<s> Joad. Tom Joad.
<s> I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
<s> Say, who runs this place?
<s> Why ain't they more like it?
<s> Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
<s> Yeah. On my way home now.
<s> Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
<s> Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
<s> I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
<s> They never wrote you nothing?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
<s> Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
<s> It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
<s> This here's a strike.
<s> Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
<s> Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
<s> Ain't a-goin', thas all...
<s> Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
<s> 'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
<s> Sure. We aim to.
<s> I'll walk back.
<s> Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
<s> No'm.
<s> I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
<s> They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
<s> We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
<s> That's right. And douse some in it.
<s> Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
<s> Granma's dead.
<s> Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
<s> I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
<s> Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
<s> You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
<s> Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
<s> California, here we come!
<s> I wisht it was day.
<s> Won't they ketch us?
<s> Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
<s> I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
<s> Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
<s> I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
<s> I'm Martin Blank.
<s> Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
<s> What?
<s> Overflowing with love.
<s> You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
<s> Here is now there. There is here.
<s> I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
<s> I'm a professional killer.
<s> No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
<s> Yep.
<s> Bad experiences.
<s> What's that?
<s> Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
<s> No.
<s> Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
<s> You don't understand...
<s> Come on.
<s> I just know.
<s> What stuff?
<s> Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
<s> Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
<s> Hard to get good help these days.
<s> Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
<s> Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
<s> Hello Martin. How have you been?
<s> That sounds pretty interesting...
<s> Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
<s> Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
<s> Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
<s> -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
<s> One cannot love and kill.
<s> Never enough.
<s> It's fine.
<s> I've looked at it.
<s> Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Work's good for the soul.
<s> See you in ten years.
<s> Good evening, Mr. Blank.
<s> Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
<s> Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
<s> Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
<s> You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
<s> Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
<s> A jogger, huh?
<s> Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
<s> I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
<s> Need a lift?
<s> No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
<s> Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
<s> She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
<s> We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
<s> Huh?
<s> I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
<s> I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
<s> -- enough time tomorrow. I know.
<s> You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
<s> Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
<s> Well, one was for salad...
<s> Did you go riding?
<s> LEAVE ME ALONE!!
<s> I said... I started.
<s> What?
<s> Who's there?
<s> That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
<s> We're very lucky.
<s> I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
<s> I love you.
<s> Doing what?
<s> No. I was just researching. Calm down.
<s> He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
<s> Why?!
<s> I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
<s> She will if you think she should.
<s> No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
<s> You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
<s> Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
<s> I don't understa-
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Oh, I don't know...
<s> No. He had the choice.
<s> Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
<s> She calls him Tommy...
<s> I was there for that shot, actually.
<s> I'd love to go there one time...
<s> Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
<s> Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
<s> He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
<s> You!
<s> Diane!
<s> You know her?
<s> Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
<s> We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> NO!
<s> We still have a way to go.
<s> Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
<s> You ever miss it?
<s> Shh!
<s> I want it.
<s> Curtis.
<s> No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
<s> Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
<s> Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
<s> Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
<s> Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
<s> Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
<s> Hmmm.
<s> No. No one special.
<s> I'm sorry. Who are you?
<s> Blow me.
<s> Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
<s> Never heard of you. Done anything?
<s> And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
<s> Okay. Let's go shopping.
<s> Yeah! Sure.
<s> You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
<s> It's my subway defense system.
<s> Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You would have looked better.
<s> Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
<s> One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
<s> You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
<s> So?
<s> Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Michael Myers.
<s> 10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
<s> Get back!
<s> Brady! Come with us.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
<s> Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
<s> Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
<s> I'm not calling the fire department.
<s> For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
<s> How many bodies did you find?
<s> If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
<s> Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
<s> Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
<s> I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
<s> Double scoops?
<s> He's coming to get me Rachel.
<s> Coming.
<s> I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
<s> I can't.
<s> Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
<s> What are we doing?
<s> Got it Ben.
<s> Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
<s> All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
<s> He's been here.
<s> Least I'm not alone.
<s> Dear God.
<s> Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
<s> I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
<s> I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
<s> The guys think I'm too smart.
<s> Of course.
<s> Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
<s> He was watching me.
<s> Annie!
<s> No, he's not.
<s> Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
<s> I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
<s> Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
<s> Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
<s> If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
<s> You all right?
<s> Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
<s> I don't think so...
<s> No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
<s> Have a good time.
<s> Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
<s> Why are they under there?
<s> And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
<s> I saw him...
<s> What is it, Laurie?
<s> You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
<s> He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
<s> What did you use before?
<s> I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
<s> You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
<s> He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
<s> Oh, listen...
<s> I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
<s> Are you really interested?
<s> ...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
<s> Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
<s> No, he called late last night.
<s> I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
<s> Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
<s> Right.
<s> Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
<s> Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
<s> And it ruins everything else.
<s> Well...
<s> Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
<s> ...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
<s> You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
<s> When did you first notice this?
<s> Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
<s> Like what?
<s> Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
<s> How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Oh.  Well, I live--
<s> Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
<s> Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
<s> Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
<s> You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
<s> No?
<s> Everything's okay? 
<s> Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
<s> Bye.
<s> Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
<s> Oh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
<s> Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
<s> What are you doing?!
<s> I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
<s> Not because of me, I hope.
<s> Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
<s> I can't say anything!
<s> Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
<s> It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
<s> Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
<s> No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
<s> Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
<s> I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
<s> Are you in love with someone else?
<s> No.
<s> Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
<s> So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
<s> I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
<s> They're in the basement.
<s> Oh, Frederick!
<s> I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
<s> Who is it?
<s> You are, you are my only connection to the world!
<s> Yeah?
<s> Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
<s> Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
<s> Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
<s> Oh...
<s> Oh, now-- 
<s> I know...I know.
<s> Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
<s> Here, you guys.  Open them up.
<s> I think he'll find that satisfying.
<s> ...you know?  I, uh...
<s> Thanks, thanks.
<s> That's a beauty!
<s> Wow!
<s> I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
<s> Well, what about artificial insemination?
<s> Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
<s> Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
<s> Uh-oh.
<s> Oh, your kids are so adorable.
<s> Oh!
<s> Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
<s> What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
<s> Well, I just came from an audition...
<s> You got it.
<s> Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
<s> I'm real upset about what you wrote.
<s> Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
<s> I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
<s> I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
<s> Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
<s> Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
<s> How are you?
<s> Oh, no.
<s> Well, I hope you've changed.
<s> I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
<s> ...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
<s> I am.  You-you made my day.
<s> It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
<s> I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
<s> Just a few minutes ago.
<s> I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
<s> God.
<s> Oh...
<s> I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
<s> Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
<s> ...read it over, and think about it.
<s> <u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
<s> I <u>swear</u> to you...
<s> I have not read you your rights.
<s> Yes, I presumed it was about him.
<s> Say it in English.
<s> Let's keep it to business, shall we?
<s> I know her by the Back.
<s> They got that kind of money?
<s> Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
<s> ...are you alright, sir...?
<s> Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
<s> Have the child taken to bed.
<s> Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
<s> Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
<s> OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
<s> No.  And...
<s> I've never heard that he...
<s> Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
<s> He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
<s> ....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
<s> ....what...? 
<s> Let the girl go.
<s> ...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
<s> And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
<s> That could be.
<s> You nervous...?
<s> Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
<s> Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
<s> 'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
<s> I have had the honor. 
<s> Enchante.
<s> Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
<s> We got KittyKat...
<s> Sir, with all due respect....
<s> <u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
<s> What is that that smells so wonderful.
<s> And how did he do that?
<s> I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
<s> ...but will that satisfy you?
<s> And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
<s> I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
<s> Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...

<s> You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
<s> ...and that is what you need to expand.
<s> ....because we don't have any mmm...
<s> It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
<s> Oh, my <u>program</u>...
<s> Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
<s> ...what did you want? 
<s> What shape is the scar?
<s> No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
<s> Hey, lost again.
<s> No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
<s> I know it well.
<s> It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
<s> Brazilian. 
<s> Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
<s> What does <u>that</u> mean?
<s> Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
<s> ...would you use a small word?
<s> What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
<s> I..
<s> Yes.
<s> When?
<s> I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
<s> Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.

<s> Hey really, I don't feel so great.
<s> Because you're an idiot.
<s> Something like that. Will you do it?

<s> Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.

<s> Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
<s> I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
<s> Yeah, maybe.
<s> Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
<s> Heather.
<s> Is she dead?
<s> You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
<s> Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
<s> Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
<s> Give me the clipboard.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
<s> How very.
<s> You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.

<s> Just get better okay?
<s> Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
<s> Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
<s> What's the occasion?
<s> Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
<s> Allison Dormere. Your intern.
<s> Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
<s> Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
<s> Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
<s> Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
<s> Really? Why?
<s> There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
<s> Where's my wife?
<s> How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
<s> Two.
<s> This game is over do you hear me?
<s> I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
<s> All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
<s> Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
<s> Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
<s> I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
<s> I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
<s> Well now there's a compliment.
<s> Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
<s> One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
<s> I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
<s> You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
<s> On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
<s> Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
<s> He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
<s> It's November.
<s> I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
<s> You mean John Bubber?
<s> I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
<s> You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
<s> Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
<s> I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
<s> Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
<s> THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
<s> Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
<s> Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
<s> If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
<s> A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
<s> You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
<s> Were you in it?  In the war?
<s> Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
<s> I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
<s> Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
<s> John, I know all about it.
<s> I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
<s> And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
<s> Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
<s> She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
<s> She's talking to him now.
<s> For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
<s> Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
<s> Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
<s> I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
<s> Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
<s> Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
<s> Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
<s> So this really does the trick, eh?
<s> Let's watch some TV.
<s> A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
<s> Well, it's for a woman.
<s> -- institution.
<s> I understand that.
<s> No, no, no, no.
<s> -- a sense of proportion.
<s> You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
<s> Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
<s> Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
<s> Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
<s> I think we should talk first.
<s> Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
<s> I've asked him what's wrong.
<s> I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
<s> He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
<s> Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
<s> You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
<s> It's a nice pool, isn't it?
<s> What?
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh -- great.
<s> No.
<s> One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
<s> Did you lock the garage door?
<s> Philip!  The senior partner?
<s> He wasn't there.
<s> There might be some extras in the garage.
<s> Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
<s> Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
<s> What for, dickweed?
<s> Do you have enough money?
<s> And I can't help having a cold.
<s> Promise.
<s> Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
<s> Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
<s> We don't have any proof of that.
<s> I think it was England.
<s> Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
<s> No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
<s> Who are you?
<s> I learned my fill from Romeriz.
<s> It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
<s> I hear you.
<s> Then it's worth the journey.
<s> We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
<s> The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
<s> Me?  Of course.
<s> Living.  Remember?
<s> What worries you?
<s> And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
<s> You'll no see me again.
<s> A lucky guess.
<s> You got me.
<s> This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
<s> It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
<s> I'll be fine.
<s> No.
<s> Not unless they're immortal.
<s> It will end tonight.
<s> Get out.
<s> What?  How?
<s> I know, Paul.
<s> I do not know -- and even if I did...
<s> It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
<s> No.
<s> Me too.
<s> There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
<s> I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
<s> If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
<s> I think he's dead!
<s> That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
<s> I'll make the call.
<s> He knows better than that.
<s> She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
<s> Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
<s> You won't die if you let me help.
<s> Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
<s> We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
<s> I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
<s> Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
<s> Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
<s> The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
<s> You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
<s> We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
<s> That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
<s> The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
<s> We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
<s> You can't run with suitcases.
<s> I got the gasoline --
<s> Dennis.
<s> I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
<s> Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
<s> You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
<s> Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
<s> My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You'd better be kidding.
<s> Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
<s> You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
<s> What I want is to help my father.
<s> What are we going to do about Mike?
<s> Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
<s> What are you doing?!  Stop that!
<s> York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
<s> Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
<s> I know the one.
<s> Go.
<s> Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
<s> Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
<s> Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
<s> Chief, it's Mikkelson.
<s> How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
<s> We're okay.
<s> Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
<s> No!  They're right here --
<s> Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
<s> You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
<s> Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<s> Of course.
<s> Let me explain.
<s> How many in your family?
<s> I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
<s> Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
<s> Canadian Club?
<s> Their people?
<s> I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
<s> Watch everything? How? They are gone.
<s> And what will they do with these satellites?
<s> Well rewarded Those were his words.
<s> You said you had no whiskey.
<s> I'll be over.
<s> After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
<s> I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
<s> Listen, you need me.
<s> How so.
<s> You think they will believe you?
<s> I am always glad to see you Paul.
<s> I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
<s> Take the river road back. It is clear.
<s> We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
<s> Just drive, Gregoire.
<s> Promoted. House Manager.
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
<s> This goes out live?
<s> Yes, sir. What is wrong?
<s> The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
<s> That will take time.
<s> Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
<s> We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
<s> He will be here.
<s> I need a great favor.
<s> I will see what I can do.
<s> How do you know?
<s> I will give you my house.
<s> Pack the bags, we have to move.
<s> Dawn. Then they go.
<s> Where are you hurt, son?
<s> It will do just fine.
<s> Please go back, bring the children to us.
<s> What are you saying, Tatsi?
<s> Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
<s> So where is the lamb?
<s> Tell me what it was.
<s> Paul! Then another voice.
<s> Please do not talk like this.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
<s> You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
<s> Yes, thank you Mr. President.
<s> What is his room number?
<s> If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
<s> -- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
<s> But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
<s> I'm moved beyond words.
<s> It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
<s> -- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
<s> A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
<s> Ms. Marr!
<s> -- what was he doing here?
<s> As a tumor.
<s> Yeah, me too.
<s> I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
<s> -- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
<s> Poor Mr. Price --
<s> What?
<s> Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
<s> -- yeah, we did that --
<s> An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
<s> No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
<s> Back where?
<s> Let's try down here...
<s> We're safe?
<s> Run.
<s> I hope not.
<s> Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
<s> Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
<s> You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
<s> Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
<s> Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
<s> No, no, it's just --
<s> And then what happens?
<s> Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
<s> I am.
<s> -- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
<s> Something with the power, I don't know!!
<s> I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
<s> Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
<s> Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
<s> I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
<s> No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
<s> I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
<s> Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
<s> I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
<s> Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
<s> What will they tell you?
<s> Yes.  It was.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Well I bet you they're happy.
<s> She's down...how do you mean honey?
<s> I'm scared!
<s> Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
<s> We'll get it later.
<s> I'm ok mommy.
<s> My God, I heard something!
<s> Good night daddy.
<s> Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
<s> The place is pretty dusty.
<s> Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
<s> Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
<s> I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
<s> She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
<s> Aubrey!
<s> We're not going.
<s> I'm all right...
<s> If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
<s> Before.
<s> You'll have to settle for turkey.
<s> It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
<s> Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
<s> Well what is it!
<s> I know what I saw.
<s> OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
<s> And what is ... this frozen moment?
<s> And why are you back?  Why are we here?
<s> What happened to him?
<s> Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
<s> Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
<s> That's great.
<s> It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
<s> The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
<s> Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
<s> Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
<s> God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
<s> No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
<s> What else came with it?  Anything still here?
<s> Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
<s> No.  Really?
<s> On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
<s> Fuck you!
<s> What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
<s> C'mon.  It'll be great.
<s> Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
<s> Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
<s> Something like that.
<s> It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
<s> Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
<s> Rutherford Auction... that name...
<s> Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
<s> No need.  Guards' station's right there.
<s> Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
<s> Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
<s> Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
<s> Why not just go now?
<s> "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
<s> Let's just forget it, I mean...
<s> Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
<s> Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
<s> Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
<s> I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
<s> Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
<s> I'll bring my entire repertoire...
<s> Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
<s> Oh, I'm so sorry...
<s> Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
<s> When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
<s> Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
<s> Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
<s> Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
<s> Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
<s> Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
<s> If you think you're getting past me...
<s> You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
<s> And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
<s> Bastard!  If you were a true American.
<s> Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
<s> Why George, you big softie...
<s> No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
<s> Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
<s> Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
<s> Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
<s> I know they're gonna buy that stock --
<s> Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
<s> Mind if I join you?
<s> Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
<s> ...Why don't I just type this up...
<s> I know that, Amy.
<s> Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
<s> Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
<s> Consider this my resignation --
<s> Norville!
<s> Sez who?
<s> I don't know...
<s> You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Forty-eight years...
<s> What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
<s> I --
<s> Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
<s> But, buddy --
<s> But, buddy, you were --
<s> But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
<s> Yes sir...
<s> Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
<s> Well, why don't ya read it.
<s> Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
<s> I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
<s> You --
<s> Oh my God, sir!
<s> Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
<s> Maybe he's wise.
<s> He notices.
<s> ...Her mother needs an operation...
<s> He don't look wise.
<s> Thank you for waking me.
<s> Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
<s> But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
<s> You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
<s> I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
<s> I've never heard of a cure.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
<s> I like her already.
<s> Thank you.  But who sits there? 
<s> It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
<s> Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
<s> But she's not dead, Wes.
<s> No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
<s> I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
<s> Good morning.
<s> You didn't drive her mad.
<s> Help me? How?
<s> You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
<s> How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
<s> This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
<s> Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
<s> That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
<s> Why shouldn't she be?
<s> Good night.
<s> You want to go?
<s> So early?
<s> I do. I'm -- are you...?
<s> I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
<s> That shirt?
<s> You go dry off now.
<s> So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
<s> Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
<s> Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
<s> Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
<s> Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
<s> Hnnn.
<s> Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
<s> Stay out of trouble.
<s> What?
<s> Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
<s> And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
<s> That's besides the point.
<s> -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
<s> -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
<s> Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
<s> Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
<s> Mom. Are you ok?
<s> Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
<s> It's not a bother.
<s> It's not like we're too busy.
<s> Yes.
<s> I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
<s> I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
<s> I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
<s> Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
<s> Do what?
<s> Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
<s> Let's see!
<s> Thanks for the advice dad.
<s> Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
<s> Sure, anything but this English.
<s> Greetings, Charles.
<s> Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
<s> Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
<s> Can I come?
<s> One more shot?
<s> That's nice. Are you drunk?
<s> I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
<s> What's that, then?
<s> Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
<s> Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
<s> Yeah.  All over.
<s> Twelve years younger.
<s> Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
<s> I told her to come.
<s> I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
<s> She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> That's right.
<s> Even the best make mistakes.
<s> But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
<s> Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
<s> Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
<s> There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
<s> Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
<s> You don't know.
<s> But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
<s> Who?
<s> You're going to be brought in for questioning.
<s> Yes down at the station.
<s> Did you have sex with her?
<s> I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
<s> He.  Well, he...
<s> There's nothing more to talk about.
<s> Yes, and very beautiful.
<s> Then God does not exist...
<s> You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
<s> She is.
<s> It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
<s> We can do that?
<s> I can't save her.
<s> Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
<s> You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
<s> I have. Or there would be twice as many.
<s> Is that supposed to frighten me?
<s> Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
<s> Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
<s> And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
<s> Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
<s> Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
<s> Never.
<s> You really believe that?
<s> I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
<s> They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
<s> But why do you want me?
<s> Yes...
<s> Sure...
<s> Dying?
<s> The crucifix -
<s> You have fed. You were made for this...
<s> Do you think so?
<s> But how do you know?
<s> I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
<s> I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
<s> You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
<s> That's all past, Lestat.
<s> You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
<s> Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
<s> You're not lying to me, are you?
<s> He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
<s> If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
<s> Yes...
<s> Checking in...Karla Wilson.
<s> And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
<s> July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
<s> Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
<s> Who? Who is here?
<s> Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
<s> No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
<s> Yet. Nothing yet.
<s> No, I'm the King of the World.
<s> Karla! You promised.
<s> Some.
<s> Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
<s> Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
<s> We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
<s> Ray, we're just friend.
<s> Will you try...for me, please?
<s> Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
<s> Who?
<s> It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
<s> It beets being on the mainland.
<s> It's...him.
<s> He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
<s> We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
<s> I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
<s> They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
<s> I don't know, but I'm starving.
<s> Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
<s> Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
<s> How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
<s> See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
<s> Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
<s> And do what with it?
<s> This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
<s> Or even spirit messages from the next world.
<s> Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
<s> I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
<s> Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
<s> That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
<s> Sleep well.
<s> I don't know now without my father.
<s> She has never mentioned her family.
<s> I was looking for you.
<s> That should decide it or you --
<s> Miss Wollsten!
<s> ) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
<s> Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
<s> Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
<s> She's not too well.
<s> This girl -- Thea - is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
<s> Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
<s> It is for that he hates me.
<s> So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
<s> Who?
<s> Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
<s> Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
<s> What did . . .
<s> Suicide.
<s> I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
<s> I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
<s> No wonder you jumped in the river.
<s> Made what?
<s> No, of course not.
<s> Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
<s> Well, naturally. Of course.
<s> If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
<s> That's the kid.
<s> Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
<s> It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
<s> That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
<s> Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
<s> Well, what happened to you?
<s> Will you try to get some sleep?
<s> Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
<s> Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
<s> Nice girl, Mary.
<s> Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
<s> Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
<s> And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
<s> Ummmm . . .
<s> Don't hurt my ear again!
<s> Oh, George.
<s> Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
<s> What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
<s> Oh . . .
<s> He's pretty young for that job.
<s> Maybe you were born older, George.
<s> Still after that first million before you're thirty.
<s> Harry . . . Harry . . .
<s> Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
<s> I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
<s> Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
<s> It's important.
<s> How do you do.
<s> I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
<s> How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
<s> Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
<s> Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
<s> Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
<s> Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
<s> I'll take chocolate.
<s> Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
<s> I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
<s> Come on, tell me.
<s> Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
<s> Would you rather leave?
<s> That does it  come here.
<s> Please, let's not stop, George.
<s> To keep from being an old maid.
<s> My baby.
<s> Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
<s> Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
<s> Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
<s> Well, I don't know....
<s> Soon, dark eyes, soon.
<s> I'm supposed to.
<s> Stop paddling!
<s> Back down!
<s> Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
<s> No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
<s> We're hung up on something.
<s> Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
<s> We'll take your supercargo.
<s> There's a shark....
<s> What the hell, we're steering for it.
<s> You bet.  Hang on....
<s> Anyone got another set of sails?
<s> Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
<s> If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
<s> You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
<s> Right.
<s> You can't stop me.
<s> Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
<s> No place special.  Just hanging out.
<s> Oh, c'mon.
<s> You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
<s> Hey, come on....
<s> Pop.  I'm sorry.
<s> Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
<s> All of us thank you, okay?
<s> Is that what it is?
<s> Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
<s> The Shark's mouth.
<s> I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
<s> Can't you tell?
<s> Why?
<s> And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
<s> Home it is.
<s> Door's locked.
<s> Mrs. Silvera.
<s> It's good with coffee.
<s> For me?
<s> Terrific.
<s> It was bad, wasn't it.
<s> Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
<s> Just one minute....
<s> Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
<s> Two of them are still missing!
<s> Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
<s> Someone has to do something.
<s> What for?
<s> That's it?
<s> 10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
<s> Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
<s> That's what he said.
<s> Shouldn't he be at home?
<s> You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
<s> Dad!  Dad!
<s> That's you.
<s> Waiting for Andy.
<s> They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
<s> Huh?
<s> Nope.
<s> And second?
<s> Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
<s> Mike?  Our Mike?
<s> Figure they split?
<s> Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
<s> Is there something I don't know about?
<s> I'll be right there.  Wait up.
<s> Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
<s> Coming about....
<s> If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
<s> Might as well.
<s> You going with Patrick?
<s> Coming about, then.
<s> You always go with Andy.
<s> Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
<s> Quiet!  Shhh!
<s> Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
<s> Forget it, he won't listen.
<s> No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
<s> I can get it.
<s> It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
<s> You buying?
<s> No.
<s> What is it, 97 days?
<s> ... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
<s> I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
<s> No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
<s> Hi, baby.
<s> ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
<s> Up.
<s> God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
<s> Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
<s> Yes?
<s> No, you're not.
<s> Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
<s> What's up?
<s> Sure.  Let's go.
<s> ... Mean through the tubes?
<s> I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
<s> Hydrophobia...
<s> I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
<s> It's a shark's tooth!
<s> That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
<s> Only to myself.
<s> Make this quick!
<s> Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
<s> No!
<s> It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
<s> So do I, love.
<s> I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
<s> Afraid I can't do that.
<s> Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
<s> Should be coming out of it soon.
<s> Somebody could have gotten hurt.
<s> And here I thought I was charming you.
<s> The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
<s> They still seem nervous.
<s> Not good enough.
<s> Well, wait till you see the rest.
<s> Are you really?
<s> That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
<s> No, Kelly, I don't want to...
<s> Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
<s> It's okay, Sean.
<s> Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
<s> Now what?
<s> Don't you dare.
<s> What?
<s> That?
<s> Precisely.
<s> How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
<s> It's large enough...
<s> ... I'll go to McDonalds.
<s> Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
<s> So was Dad.
<s> Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
<s> Don't hurry back.
<s> Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
<s> No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
<s> Yes, you can make sandwiches....
<s> My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
<s> Because....
<s> I don't know...You...I don't know.
<s> Then don't come any closer.
<s> They're at the beach....
<s> But it went away...We would have known....
<s> I like it.  Really....
<s> I can't help it....
<s> I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
<s> I'd be afraid of losing....
<s> I'm not doing anything.
<s> Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Where's the lady who brings the soda?
<s> Mother....
<s> I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
<s> Come on, I'll show you around.
<s> I am.
<s> Why'd you come out here?
<s> I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
<s> Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
<s> Doesn't matter....
<s> If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
<s> Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
<s> No!
<s> You're the man who drives the plane.
<s> We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
<s> A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
<s> She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
<s> Aye, aye, Captain....
<s> Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
<s> Will you leave me alone...?
<s> I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
<s> The readings suck....
<s> You didn't stick them on right....
<s> It's not a bad life, Jake....
<s> I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
<s> Don't say anything about this to my mother....
<s> You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
<s> What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
<s> As long as he's been here....
<s> Maybe it's gone....
<s> You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
<s> I live to hear the sound...You all right?
<s> 'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
<s> Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
<s> Screw you, Jake....
<s> I've got to get to her....
<s> I'm the one who wanted to study it....
<s> Don't flatter yourself.... 
<s> Oh, Jake... 
<s> We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
<s> What?
<s> Oh no--
<s> I think you're here all day.
<s> Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
<s> Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
<s> It's a method for quitting smoking.
<s> Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
<s> Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
<s> O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
<s> I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
<s> I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
<s> I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
<s> I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
<s> You want me to stop the car?
<s> Listen to me saying what?
<s> Just makes to so God damned mad ..
<s> You don't really believe this?
<s> Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
<s> Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
<s> I guess by the bed.
<s> <u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
<s> We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
<s> Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
<s> I don't see that at all ..
<s> I thought it was Taylor's case?
<s> I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
<s> Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
<s> He ain't offerin me shit.
<s> I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
<s> I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
<s> No, it has a mind of its own.
<s> Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
<s> Yes.
<s> I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
<s> Of course I would ..
<s> Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
<s> Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
<s> Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
<s> I can't identify him ..
<s> I don't want them to arrest you.
<s> Two or three years ago.
<s> Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
<s> Even better.
<s> I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
<s> Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
<s> I'm already walking. Where is it?
<s> He has? .. What's he doing here?
<s> Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
<s> Ask him.
<s> Ugh!
<s> Okay, this is working.
<s> You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
<s> No.
<s> No no. I knew.
<s> Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
<s> Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
<s> Plus, you could use that commission.
<s> Yeah, what happened there.
<s> I'm relieved you said that.
<s> Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
<s> What?
<s> Good night.
<s> Easy, easy --
<s> Fine, I just --
<s> Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
<s> No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
<s> Why do you love me?
<s> So this break... is a break-up.
<s> Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
<s> If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
<s> Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
<s> -- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
<s> I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
<s> Okay.
<s> Now you want Arizona dollars.
<s> Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
<s> I gotta get back to Cushman.
<s> Call me tomorrow.
<s> Huh?
<s> I understand your anxiety.
<s> But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
<s> You.
<s> No, I'm saying to be --
<s> Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
<s> Oh, we gonna be friends now?
<s> No, I don't know.
<s> No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Damn right.
<s> Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
<s> I missed ya.  What can I say?
<s> Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
<s> To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
<s> I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
<s> The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
<s> I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
<s> You'll lose.
<s> I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
<s> Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
<s> I'm scared.  What is it?
<s> Shut up!!!
<s> We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
<s> What?
<s> Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
<s> So do you.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Eric!
<s> I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
<s> Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
<s> That one time was just the bumper.
<s> I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
<s> We're not going anywhere, I promise.
<s> How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
<s> But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
<s> Who's that?
<s> Where is it?
<s> DAD!
<s> I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
<s> They're here.
<s> No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
<s> The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
<s> Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
<s> Baryonyx?
<s> Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
<s> Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
<s> Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
<s> Raptors, mostly.
<s> It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
<s> Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
<s> In Costa Rica?
<s> No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
<s> But then you never get to go in space.
<s> Something must've scared them.
<s> She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
<s> No we're not.
<s> This plane can not land!
<s> Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
<s> Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
<s> Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
<s> The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
<s> It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
<s> Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
<s> Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
<s> Kelly!  What are you doing here?
<s> Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
<s> My vacation is over in a week.
<s> Where does it say that?
<s> Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
<s> What?  Why?
<s> Okay.
<s> I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
<s> Isn't it obvious?
<s> Piss.
<s> Good.
<s> Possible.
<s> Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
<s> Oh, God.
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
<s> Look!  Sarah!
<s> Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
<s> Feeling a bit blue, are we?
<s> It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
<s> It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
<s> That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
<s> Funded by whom?
<s> It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
<s> Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
<s> I believe in him.
<s> Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
<s> Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
<s> There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
<s> A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
<s> Why?
<s> They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
<s> Small versions of adults, honey.
<s> What kind of park is it?
<s> We're out of a job.
<s> I know.
<s> And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
<s> I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
<s> I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
<s> Why not?
<s> Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
<s> He sends his apologies.
<s> Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
<s> Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
<s> Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
<s> That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
<s> Yes it is.
<s> "Thunder lizard!"
<s> I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
<s> It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
<s> But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
<s> Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
<s> Try to!
<s> Why?
<s> Kids get scared.
<s> When you gotta go, you gotta go.
<s> You're sure?!
<s> We gotta do something.
<s> For today, I guarantee it.
<s> I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
<s> What kind of opinions?
<s> Wu?
<s> What does he mean by "target audience"?
<s> After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
<s> No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
<s> Oh, I hate the other kind.
<s> Dorkatops!
<s> It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
<s> Please!
<s> Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
<s> Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
<s> Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
<s> Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
<s> I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
<s> I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
<s> Fifty? We need seventy-five.
<s> Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
<s> Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
<s> Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
<s> And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
<s> Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
<s> It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
<s> Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
<s> Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
<s> So?
<s> Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
<s> Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
<s> He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
<s> Me too. I'm drunk.
<s> He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
<s> Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
<s> That doesn't make sense.
<s> A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
<s> How's that possible?
<s> If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
<s> Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
<s> Yes -- we do.
<s> You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
<s> You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
<s> Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
<s> -- In magazines nobody reads.
<s> Did you?
<s> -- In what sense?
<s> Success or nothing?
<s> There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
<s> Yes.
<s> What an extraordinary request!
<s> He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
<s> Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
<s> Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
<s> It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
<s> -- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
<s> In a small way.
<s> One of you must be mistaken.
<s> Yes.
<s> I suspected that he -- well.
<s> Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
<s> And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
<s> Tonight?
<s> I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
<s> Why were you given notice?
<s> It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
<s> He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
<s> I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
<s> No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
<s> It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
<s> Then why haven't I been --
<s> It usually is.
<s> Yes.  Isn't it there?
<s> He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
<s> Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
<s> Oskar.
<s> -- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
<s> My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
<s> Amerika for us!
<s> Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
<s> I photographed it extensively, father.
<s> Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
<s> Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
<s> I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
<s> Leave it, Ann.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
<s> Jack!...  Jack!
<s> Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
<s> An ape ... some kind of ape.
<s> She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
<s> Nab- Let's get it over with.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What about him? Yes.
<s> Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
<s> Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
<s> Please --
<s> Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
<s> Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
<s> We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
<s> Here please.
<s> Yes.
<s> Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
<s> I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
<s> Could I ask some questions?
<s> -- Tuscarora --
<s> Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
<s> I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
<s> Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
<s> It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
<s> You said you wanted these.
<s> And I don't think that was Tom.
<s> No, I said what did you think.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't like getting splashed.
<s> What?
<s> I was wondering what that was.
<s> How do you know how bad it was?
<s> Trask wants to talk with you.
<s> Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
<s> I am.
<s> It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
<s> How is it back there?
<s> Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
<s> Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
<s> It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
<s> It's not so bad.
<s> Did she talk about him to you?
<s> I think she's trying that.
<s> You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
<s> Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
<s> Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
<s> He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
<s> I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
<s> Trask --
<s> Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
<s> He's in his room, playing.
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Lunch in a restaurant.
<s> In real life when does he hit you?
<s> Ladies and gentlemen...
<s> Greatest...
<s> The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
<s> Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
<s> I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
<s> Mom, I mean dad?
<s> Uh huh...
<s> Some of the brown stuff is still there.
<s> No.
<s> That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
<s> Good night.
<s> Don't let the bedbugs bite.
<s> Sure.
<s> Yep.
<s> Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
<s> Like a principal?
<s> I don't understand, daddy.
<s> Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
<s> Who will read me my stories?
<s> Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
<s> Yes.  Very much.
<s> Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
<s> Objection!
<s> No questions.
<s> It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
<s> Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
<s> I...I don't know...
<s> Ted, I'm leaving you.
<s> Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
<s> Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
<s> Fine.
<s> You have?
<s> Joanna, what the hell is--
<s> I don't know, Jim...
<s> Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
<s> Kramer...
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> Murray.
<s> But it's not a year from now, is it?
<s> Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
<s> You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
<s> I know....I know.
<s> First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
<s> Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
<s> We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
<s> Any prospects?
<s> Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
<s> I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
<s> I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
<s> I understand.
<s> No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
<s> No.  I don't think so.
<s> Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
<s> Uh, huh...
<s> You and Charley?
<s> All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
<s> Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
<s> Ha!  You tell me.
<s> But, I am in charge.
<s> And you have horses? You love horses.
<s> Will you buy the sheep for me?
<s> No!
<s> Are you, General?
<s> Soon.
<s> I am afraid.
<s> Far, far away.
<s> Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
<s> I accept it. What is suffering?
<s> Answer. 
<s> You could buy them.
<s> I am him.
<s> Roughly five thousand men.
<s> It is an island. American territory.
<s> He warned about the future of Tibet.
<s> Can India help us?
<s> And, America?
<s> The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
<s> Where is that?
<s> Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
<s> Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
<s> Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
<s> You decide.
<s> Does he have the spot?
<s> Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
<s> Is that true or pretend?
<s> Pretend.
<s> But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
<s> Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
<s> Eliminate you.
<s> Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
<s> My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I need to see his habitat.
<s> <u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
<s> They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
<s> Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
<s> Cocktail?
<s> They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
<s> What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
<s> Yup.
<s> You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
<s> Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
<s> Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
<s> I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
<s> Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
<s> Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
<s> Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
<s> I never had sex with you!
<s> Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
<s> Yeah.  Thanks to you.
<s> Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
<s> Never been to Maine before?
<s> Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
<s> Good.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
<s> But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
<s> Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
<s> Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
<s> You calm down!
<s> Alright, Jack!
<s> I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
<s> No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
<s> Likewise.
<s> Good thinking.
<s> Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
<s> We shouldn't even really be doing this.
<s> You too.
<s> And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
<s> Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
<s> Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
<s> <u>Apologize</u>?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Hector thinks you like him.
<s> I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
<s> Yes.
<s> Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
<s> Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
<s> Kevin, hey.
<s> You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
<s> I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
<s> It's ten after nine.
<s> Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
<s> I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
<s> Kelly--
<s> <u>Kelly</u>--
<s> It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<s> It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
<s> Liar?
<s> Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
<s> Thanks, Ardelia.
<s> Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
<s> He's here, Ardelia.
<s> 'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
<s> Where?
<s> Get me out!
<s> Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
<s> Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
<s> I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
<s> That wasn't me.
<s> Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
<s> Jack Gordon.
<s> Who's the subject?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
<s> It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
<s> But if he knew we have so little time -
<s> I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
<s> You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
<s> Starling -
<s> Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
<s> Not lately. But maybe someday.
<s> He said - "I can smell your cunt."
<s> A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
<s> Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
<s> I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
<s> Was it a butterfly?
<s> That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
<s> What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
<s> You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
<s> Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
<s> Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
<s> I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
<s> Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
<s> No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
<s> You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
<s> Did you breast-feed her?
<s> The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
<s> We leave in the morning?!
<s> Can we rest soon?
<s> I have nothing to go back for.
<s> Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
<s> He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
<s> Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
<s> Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
<s> "Some"?
<s> It can be dangerous...
<s> He delivered no such message.
<s> I am sorry, Duncan...
<s> Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
<s> No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
<s> ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
<s> Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
<s> What else?
<s> It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
<s> That's all, sir.
<s> What did you see, Major?
<s> Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
<s> Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
<s> And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
<s> General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
<s> Fire!
<s> Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
<s> For Munro children?
<s> British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
<s> And this?
<s> Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
<s> Carry them to England to your King with pride.
<s> France.
<s> Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
<s> These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
<s> Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
<s> Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
<s> He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
<s> Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
<s> There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
<s> What has?
<s> What dead one on the ship?
<s> Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
<s> No.
<s> No!
<s> Shit...
<s> Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
<s> The escape bubbles?
<s> How much time does that give us?
<s> I can't see them!
<s> And it killed Bo?
<s> I know that.
<s> Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
<s> The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
<s> ...and a Russian grandmother...
<s> Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
<s> What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
<s> I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
<s> It's had a meal.
<s> I still will, if you don't mind.
<s> And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
<s> That inspires confidence, that does.
<s> Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
<s> Apart from those shotguns.
<s> A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
<s> There were two old guns there; where are they?
<s> Yeah, Bazza, what?
<s> Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
<s> It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
<s> I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
<s> No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
<s> Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
<s> Try that one.
<s> You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
<s> Furry muff, let's go.
<s> Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
<s> Just give me the keys.
<s> Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
<s> I mean it, there is only three of us here.
<s> Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
<s> If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
<s> Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
<s> He means they're thieving dogs.
<s> Right as rain.
<s> He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
<s> I'11 meet you in the car.
<s> You will what?
<s> I like your bar.
<s> I think you'll find it is in your interest.
<s> I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
<s> I'll only be a minute.
<s> Get your fingers out of my soup!
<s> When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
<s> Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
<s> That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
<s> Er, fertilizer.
<s> We need fertilizer, Winston.
<s> Just shut up.
<s> So?
<s> They're not going to jail.
<s> Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
<s> You think I can't learn that?
<s> I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
<s> No, sir. Not at all.
<s> No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
<s> So is Buddy on your short list?
<s> You got to investigate. No question about it.
<s> Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
<s> Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
<s> I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
<s> Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
<s> Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
<s> Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
<s> --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
<s> Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
<s> Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
<s> No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
<s> If it's too late--
<s> They fought against the Indians?
<s> No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
<s> He's still pissed off about it.
<s> These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
<s> My father.
<s> He does.
<s> Cool.
<s> Made some money, came back here--
<s> It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
<s> Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
<s> You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
<s> I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
<s> If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
<s> What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
<s> You could take it--
<s> You know who it was they dug up?
<s> This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
<s> Good deal you were born down here, then.
<s> Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
<s> Appreciate it, sir.
<s> The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
<s> I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
<s> You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
<s> Protection?
<s> Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
<s> No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
<s> Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
<s> I have some friends who have had a accident--
<s> Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
<s> He was a unique individual.
<s> We don't need a new jail.
<s> We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
<s> She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
<s> You go by your old house?
<s> And I understand why you might want to think he could.
<s> Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
<s> People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
<s> It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
<s> Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
<s> Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
<s> A little older than Paloma is now.
<s> Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
<s> Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
<s> Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
<s> It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
<s> Yeah?
<s> It's Saturday.
<s> Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
<s> I thought he busted you a couple times.
<s> They've got my Amado.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> I can't name anybody she does like these days.
<s> So she tells me three times a week.
<s> Yeah.
<s> With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
<s> Pilar--
<s> Nothing.
<s> You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
<s> More, I hope.
<s> I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
<s> The shooter local?
<s> Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
<s> Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
<s> I been working on a few things.
<s> You'd do a good job.
<s> Don't know if I'll still want it.
<s> Just doing my job.
<s> You telling me what to do, Roderick?
<s> What's up?
<s> Another woman?
<s> You know who it was?
<s> Name's Otis.
<s> Runnin' numbers illegal.
<s> You going to tell him?
<s> You believe that?
<s> How?
<s> That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
<s> Knew what?
<s> And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
<s> Yes...
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
<s> When do you want me to start?
<s> You haven't seen anything yet.
<s> Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
<s> You didn't marry him for love.
<s> That's my business. Harry.
<s> Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
<s> Yes.  You do that.
<s> No.
<s> I'm sure.  He's dead.
<s> And they all came...
<s> Hang on!
<s> Harry...
<s> Yes.
<s> The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
<s> Somebody killed him.
<s> I just saw him.
<s> I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
<s> --vanished.
<s> Oh, I've got plenty.
<s> Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
<s> Are you a gambling man?
<s> Are you a believer, then?
<s> Yes.  It's regrettable
<s> Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
<s> Shut up!
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
<s> I won't say anything.
<s> I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
<s> What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
<s> You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
<s> Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
<s> Will that do?  No?
<s> And you're not?
<s> He's better off this way.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> What about Philip Swann?
<s> These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
<s> So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
<s> You'll do it?
<s> My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
<s> Two years.
<s> 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
<s> Hi, Charlie.
<s> No, I was looking at you.
<s> You're possessive.
<s> You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
<s> Where'd you grow up?
<s> John thinks I'm so snotty.
<s> I know, but that's what you like about me.
<s> Oh, she'll love it.
<s> No.
<s> Around.
<s> I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
<s> I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
<s> I'll miss you.
<s> Yes?
<s> That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
<s> Good-night.
<s> Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
<s> Zoe, come say hello to your father...
<s> Ok.
<s> Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
<s> Do you want I send it to your room?
<s> One moment, please.
<s> Sure.
<s> I got some hair stuff.
<s> Sure.
<s> We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
<s> Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
<s> Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
<s> Do you think they have a room here?
<s> She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
<s> Hmmm.
<s> Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
<s> And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
<s> It's nothing.
<s> Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
<s> I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
<s> I think I should join you.
<s> You heard voices, you know you did.
<s> Something he said, just before...
<s> Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
<s> Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
<s> Father, I'm right here.
<s> Miette, come here and relax.
<s> How many weeks are you honey/
<s> ...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
<s> I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
<s> Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
<s> In the end, the jury saw it my way.
<s> An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
<s> Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
<s> It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
<s> The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
<s> If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
<s> The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
<s> Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
<s> I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
<s> Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
<s> The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
<s> When's your birthday?
<s> I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
<s> So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
<s> What did he say to you in French?
<s> It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
<s> We need all the help we can get.
<s> You are the younger of two...
<s> Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
<s> I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
<s> We millionaires yet?
<s> As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
<s> Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
<s> I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
<s> Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
<s> You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
<s> Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
<s> Really?  Well, come on, then.
<s> It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
<s> Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
<s> What?
<s> No one's forcing her.
<s> Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
<s> You lost your head.
<s> But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
<s> I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
<s> What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
<s> My Dad always drives my Mom.
<s> Man, forget you then, stupid.
<s> I know this.  What do you want?
<s> And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
<s> Who's Spalding?
<s> Would you watch the damn road?
<s> I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> So you took Shawnee, huh?
<s> None of your business.
<s> It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
<s> I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
<s> It happens, right...
<s> You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
<s> Nobody.
<s> Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
<s> The "man" again.
<s> If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
<s> I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
<s> I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
<s> I'm alright.  But you can sit.
<s> Yup.
<s> Kiss my ass.
<s> Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
<s> Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
<s> Getting there.
<s> Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
<s> That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
<s> It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
<s> Something was just missing.
<s> Find.
<s> What?
<s> What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
<s> So you're gonna bitch up?
<s> I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
<s> You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
<s> If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
<s> C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
<s> Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
<s> I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
<s> Nona, please.
<s> This is just about money, you know that.
<s> I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
<s> So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
<s> What?
<s> I mean, it's not true, is it?
<s> We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
<s> Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
<s> I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
<s> I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
<s> I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
<s> You want me to fuck off?
<s> I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
<s> ooohhhhhh no.
<s> In my sleep, Burt.
<s> No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I'm really only equipped to take orders --
<s> I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
<s> Does this sound weird?
<s> It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
<s> No.  No.
<s> Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
<s> I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
<s> Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
<s> It's fine.
<s> We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
<s> No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
<s> Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
<s> Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
<s> Bye.
<s> ...yeah...
<s> Let's make a deal.
<s> What?
<s> I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
<s> Can I tell you something?
<s> You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
<s> I've got troubles.
<s> You mind if I come in, check things?
<s> Yes.
<s> I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
<s> If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
<s> Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
<s> We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
<s> We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
<s> I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
<s> No.
<s> -- and I'm through playin' games.
<s> He's doing the interview with the lady --
<s> What happend?
<s> Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
<s> Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
<s> Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
<s> -- Samuel Johnson.
<s> "Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
<s> Mmm.Hmm.
<s> Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
<s> -- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
<s> FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
<s> Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
<s> Yes I do.
<s> Do you wanna sit down?
<s> I'm trying.
<s> There's no asshole like you.
<s> Is Jack your son?
<s> It's ok.
<s> Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
<s> Graduation?
<s> Let's talk about --
<s> It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
<s> Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
<s> My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
<s> I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
<s> "Frank" was my mother's father.
<s> Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
<s> For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
<s> I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
<s> About three weeks ago.
<s> I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
<s> Calm down.
<s> Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
<s> Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
<s> And what about screaming?
<s> No.
<s> I don't have to do a god damn thing.
<s> THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
<s> Did your wife find out?
<s> Then what?
<s> I got in trouble at school.
<s> For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
<s> I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
<s> It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
<s> I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
<s> It'll take the pain away.
<s> I'm a bad person.
<s> Rose, I don't --
<s> Paula.  Ellen.
<s> No one else that I know?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes.  What's your name?
<s> You're her boyfriend?
<s> Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
<s> It's alright.
<s> No they don't --
<s> I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
<s> If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
<s> Linda --
<s> PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
<s> 818-753-0088.
<s> Water.
<s> And um....do you have Swank magazine?
<s> Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
<s> Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
<s> Do you have that?
<s> That's it.
<s> Should be one-thirty.
<s> You're late, not me.
<s> I'm fine. nothing.
<s> Yes.
<s> Go to bed.
<s> Hi.
<s> I have money to give you.
<s> It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
<s> It's raining frogs from the sky.
<s> That is good.
<s> M'lady...?
<s> D'Artagnan.
<s> We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
<s> I wish to discuss your brother.
<s> First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
<s> Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
<s> Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
<s> Replace the king.
<s> There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
<s> Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
<s> Three days??!!
<s> I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
<s> Hold your goblet with two fingers.
<s> The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
<s> Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
<s> There are more important things than tits.
<s> Forgiveness?
<s> Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
<s> Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
<s> Well... Well... Okay.
<s> We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
<s> Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
<s> At a ball, everyone watches the King!
<s> He lures us to capture.
<s> She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
<s> We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
<s> Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
<s> Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
<s> I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
<s> I know.
<s> You trust his character more than anyone else does.
<s> Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
<s> There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
<s> No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
<s> If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
<s> Just... water.
<s> Phillippe.  Rest now.
<s> There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
<s> At least help Raoul.
<s> It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
<s> Yes, your Majesty.
<s> My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
<s> No, Keeper.
<s> ... Two-thirty-seven.
<s> What was the end page?
<s> Yes, yes, go on.
<s> The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
<s> Shoot them!  Shoot them!
<s> Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
<s> If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
<s> If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
<s> Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
<s> You mean shut your ass down!
<s> He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
<s> Fine...
<s> Fine -
<s> Did you start out area six?
<s> I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
<s> It wasn't in the cards.
<s> And what did he do to the girl?
<s> Yeah?
<s> No...
<s> No -
<s> Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
<s> It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
<s> This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
<s> It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
<s> A bank?
<s> I'm not going anywhere!
<s> Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
<s> Screw him!
<s> Not with this...
<s> Why aren't you ever alone with him?
<s> What's the bottom line?
<s> How are Molly and the boy?
<s> That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
<s> Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
<s> It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
<s> What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
<s> Somebody hurt him?
<s> He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
<s> Why?
<s> See? You do know something about him.
<s> To recover the mind set.
<s> You.
<s> We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
<s> Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
<s> It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
<s> There's no connection between the families.
<s> There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
<s> Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
<s> Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
<s> Don't talk to me!!
<s> This is our boy...!
<s> How far away's the back-up?
<s> Wait for the back-up! Will?
<s> Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
<s> Tonic will be fine.
<s> You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
<s> It's a surprise.
<s> I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
<s> Are you okay...?
<s> Me.
<s> Was I in an accident?
<s> Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
<s> Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
<s> Please, no.
<s> Not me.
<s> You'll let me go now?
<s> Absolutely,
<s> When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
<s> No. I can help you.
<s> Cut the general crap.
<s> Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
<s> Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
<s> Hey, baby! Where are you?
<s> None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
<s> You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
<s> Will? Are you okay?
<s> It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
<s> I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
<s> That's not true.
<s> You got a deal...
<s> I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
<s> Go on to the house.
<s> Go on to the house...
<s> Yeah...
<s> No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
<s> With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
<s> I keep getting it for Christmas.
<s> I got it. Thank you.
<s> No.
<s> I thought you would have some ideas.
<s> That's interesting.
<s> Yes. I'd considered it.
<s> Do you know how you caught me, Will?
<s> Pretty well.
<s> ...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
<s> No.  Caspiar.
<s> It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
<s> I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
<s> George, I hate sitcoms.
<s> I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
<s> I refuse.
<s> But George, I like to push the boundaries...
<s> There'll be other shots.
<s> You've got good days and bad days.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
<s> Twenty!
<s> I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
<s> Hi... am I late?
<s> No thanks.
<s> Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
<s> Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
<s> I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
<s> It's me.
<s> They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
<s> Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
<s> What?!?
<s> Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
<s> Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
<s> I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
<s> I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
<s> Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
<s> Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
<s> I used to think you were original.
<s> FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
<s> What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
<s> Where?
<s> Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
<s> No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
<s> Oh, God.
<s> It's Choi.
<s> I know.  It's her fault.
<s> Two grand.
<s> Right...
<s> All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
<s> Cypher?  Where's Tank?
<s> My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
<s> The Matrix isn't real!
<s> Really?
<s> How many were there?
<s> Shit!  Apoc?
<s> What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
<s> Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
<s> Yes.
<s> How do you know all this?
<s> There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
<s> Far from it.
<s> Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
<s> A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
<s> I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
<s> For what?
<s> What -- what lesson?
<s> How?
<s> She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
<s> No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
<s> Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
<s> Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
<s> Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
<s> He is the One.  He is the One!
<s> I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
<s> How did you know...?
<s> Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
<s> ... shit.
<s> We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
<s> It's going into replication.
<s> That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
<s> There has to be something that we can do.
<s> What choice?
<s> Why?
<s> No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
<s> What do they want?
<s> I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
<s> Because I believe in something.
<s> Guns.  Lots of guns.
<s> I don't know.  I lost him.
<s> Hurry, Neo.
<s> Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
<s> Follow me.
<s> Sounds good.
<s> Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
<s> That means it's good.
<s> Can't we come with you?
<s> Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
<s> Be careful.
<s> I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
<s> She don't look Jewish.
<s> Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
<s> Kennedy.
<s> So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> How about Teresa?  I could talk...
<s> Should I slap him?
<s> No, she isn't.
<s> Don't worry.  I can handle it.
<s> I don't like loading crates.
<s> Listen...I'm a guest here.
<s> Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
<s> That's not going to help.
<s> Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
<s> You tell me that in front of these creeps?
<s> Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
<s> Don't be smart.
<s> That bad, huh?
<s> I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
<s> Get him in.
<s> $20.
<s> He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
<s> How much was the original loan again?
<s> 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
<s> Fine.
<s> Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
<s> What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
<s> What do they expect you to say?
<s> Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
<s> What was it?
<s> It's all right.
<s> Did you?
<s> CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
<s> You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
<s> Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
<s> For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
<s> The girls like it loud.
<s> We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
<s> Sal!... fourteen street.
<s> No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
<s> You could say that.
<s> Quiet please.
<s> Sure.
<s> You ate?
<s> Yeah, speak for yourself.
<s> He's cute.
<s> Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
<s> Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
<s> And you could care less --
<s> From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
<s> Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
<s> Both.
<s> I thought you were buying my company.
<s> How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
<s> What 'business'?
<s> That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
<s> Yeah.  Goodnight.
<s> Then why did you bring it up?
<s> Yes.
<s> But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
<s> I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
<s> -- And now you're going to pee some more.
<s> 'Yes' to the deal?
<s> Sounds good.
<s> As close as a deal could be.
<s> Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
<s> How nice for you both.
<s> I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
<s> If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
<s> Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
<s> Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
<s> No, no.  I on holiday.
<s> None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
<s> And you're a nice man, Quince.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> 'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
<s> What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
<s> I haven't.
<s> When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
<s> Watch me do what?
<s> That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
<s> Yes.  I'm tired.
<s> Why don't you get off his case?
<s> It was everything.
<s> And you can't tell me who you are.
<s> Then don't.
<s> Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
<s> -- That was the place... and you were the guy.
<s> 'Threw' you?  Where?
<s> Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
<s> I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
<s> Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes.
<s> Are you sad, Bill?
<s> Oh.  Okay.
<s> Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
<s> I guess...
<s> Are you going to fire me, Bill?
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Just a manner of speaking.
<s> 'Fish'?
<s> May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
<s> Yes?
<s> Not at all.
<s> Say again?
<s> Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
<s> How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
<s> Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
<s> With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
<s> Does she know where she's going?
<s> It's time to put this person where he belongs.
<s> An indictable offense.
<s> You fill the bill, Bill.
<s> What?
<s> I'm here.
<s> What the hell is this?  Who are you?
<s> I want to have a look around before I take you.
<s> In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
<s> 'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
<s> I'm doing great.  You ready?
<s> Yeah, I give a shit.
<s> It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
<s> Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
<s> I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
<s> Hi, honey.
<s> I know it's none of my business --
<s> Uh oh --
<s> Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
<s> It's something.
<s> C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
<s> I'm having a helluva time.
<s> No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
<s> You and 'Honey'?
<s> And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
<s> You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
<s> No --
<s> It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
<s> This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
<s> Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
<s> Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
<s> I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
<s> I'm sorry... um... ?
<s> I have no memory.
<s> Hi, Leonard.
<s> Why?
<s> Just two. So far.							  *
<s> That's right I did, didn't I?
<s> A cop?
<s> I forget.
<s> Don't say anything else.
<s> I don't want blood on them.
<s> Strip!
<s> So you have information for me?
<s> Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
<s> Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
<s> Kill him.
<s> Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
<s> Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
<s> And what did he say?
<s> I'll go see him.
<s> Help me.
<s> Why not?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Are you Teddy?
<s> So why did you come here?
<s> I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
<s> I enjoy it.
<s> Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
<s> I guess I've told you about my condition.
<s> I'll be waiting.							   *
<s> You don't have to remember to be hungry.
<s> Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
<s> He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
<s> No! Should I?
<s> Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
<s> Fucking hope not.
<s> Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
<s> I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
<s> The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
<s> Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
<s> He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
<s> Are you sure?
<s> No. You took them out.						  *
<s> He any good?
<s> They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
<s> Good.
<s> Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
<s> It's a rip and a hit.
<s> You can't.
<s> Tell them what you want.
<s> Yes you do...
<s> Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
<s> Okay.  You got the "item"?
<s> And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
<s> Really?  So, what is this, a party?
<s> Right now.
<s> Okay.
<s> Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
<s> And what is that?
<s> I'm a fiend for mojitas.
<s> She's dead...
<s> Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
<s> Cost less.  That's the point.
<s> Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
<s> Zero risk.
<s> Really?
<s> Of course.
<s> I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
<s> "Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
<s> Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
<s> I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
<s> The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
<s> We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
<s> What kind of weight?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Verdado.
<s> No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
<s> Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
<s> NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
<s> Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
<s> Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
<s> ...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
<s> We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
<s> They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
<s> ...and thanks for the flowers.
<s> Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
<s> Not French registry?
<s> You set this up!
<s> Meaning...?
<s> Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
<s> Said, a person's gotta make a living.
<s> Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
<s> I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
<s> You sure are a pretty lady.
<s> Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
<s> Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
<s> For money for what?
<s> Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
<s> It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
<s> Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
<s> Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
<s> I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
<s> What of?
<s> How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
<s> Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
<s> No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
<s> You bet I do, sir.
<s> Gonna be like money from home.
<s> Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
<s> Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
<s> Is he all right!
<s> Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
<s> What?
<s> Stop shitting me, man!
<s> Everything.
<s> The Hilton.
<s> For the money... )
<s> I know.
<s> Oh Jesus! 
<s> Not far. Just a little way.
<s> But didn't have heroin.
<s> Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
<s> Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
<s> Maybe he's changing jobs.
<s> And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
<s> Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
<s> Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
<s> That's a great philosophy.
<s> Shit.
<s> Right.
<s> ...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
<s> Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
<s> No, you talkin' at me.
<s> Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
<s> All right, motherfucker, that's it.
<s> Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
<s> Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
<s> Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
<s> Depends.  You got a memo?
<s> The kid's with them!!
<s> Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
<s> Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
<s> Across both tracks!!
<s> Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?

<s> That's camouflage...
<s> They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
<s> Peter-
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> Anything you can tell me might help.
<s> I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
<s> How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
<s> How long...?
<s> --my number one fan.
<s> What are they...?
<s> And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
<s> Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
<s> It has no nobility.
<s> Then the roads are open...
<s> My daughter must be going nuts.
<s> I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
<s> I guess that means it's okay.
<s> You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
<s> Misery?
<s> I'm getting to believe you.
<s> I'm...
<s> Show me the way?
<s> You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
<s> You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
<s> If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
<s> I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
<s> I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
<s> The what?
<s> You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
<s> ...have to wait.
<s> It looks wonderful. And so do you.
<s> No, I haven't.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
<s> He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
<s> That's nice.
<s> Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
<s> He's your client, huh?
<s> Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
<s> You think he might be missing?
<s> I'm sure you're right.
<s> If I can.
<s> Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
<s> Here it is.  Very first copy.
<s> That'd be a first.
<s> Not possible..
<s> Sean, please..
<s> Oh, I am.  Later..
<s> I suppose I did.
<s> 'Thief in the Night?'
<s> Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
<s> What else?
<s> Then don't say it.
<s> Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
<s> Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
<s> Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
<s> You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
<s> I knew where it was.
<s> Why, you going to make me a better offer?
<s> A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
<s> There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
<s> Not for seven more minutes.
<s> We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
<s> No.  Just as if I'd like to.
<s> Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Far right.
<s> - torque wrench.
<s> Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
<s> Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
<s> Listen to what?
<s> Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
<s> You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
<s> So do I.  Sort of.
<s> Of what?
<s> Damn, you're beautiful.
<s> Five, six-hundred thousand.
<s> Sean Ambrose, for one.
<s> This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
<s> I'd like a little more conviction..
<s> You can be a thief and have a conscience.
<s> Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
<s> You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
<s> Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
<s> No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
<s> No.  You just looked as if you did.
<s> Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
<s> Why did you phrase it like that?
<s> Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
<s> You mean it'll be difficult.
<s> Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
<s> Yes, he knew.  Just..
<s> Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
<s> Good job.  And thanks.
<s> You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
<s> They'll kill me.
<s> You're right, of course.
<s> His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
<s> Krieger.
<s> We got it.  On your feet.
<s> Talking's good, walking's better.
<s> No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
<s> I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
<s> You didn't have to.........
<s> Bastard!
<s> Is this the only way?
<s> You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
<s> This stuff is so sticky.
<s> Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
<s> Theyre dead.
<s> Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
<s> Yeah.  I follow you.
<s> You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
<s> Information.
<s> Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
<s> About what?
<s> You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
<s> The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
<s> Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
<s> How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
<s> Where exactly is it?
<s> What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
<s> Higher.
<s> You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
<s> When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
<s> Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
<s> Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
<s> You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
<s> I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
<s> Yeah.
<s> A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
<s> I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
<s> And get a doctor.
<s> Keep counting Claire.
<s> Youre wrong about one thing.  Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
<s> That's not so good for you, my friend.
<s> Connection denied.
<s> Its not working.
<s> I always check the batteries.
<s> Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
<s> Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
<s> His brother.
<s> Yes.
<s> You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
<s> Bed.
<s> You did this once it didn't work out.
<s> It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
<s> Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
<s> And what did they say?
<s> He's in Palermo.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Maybe I should come back another time.
<s> I'm making you a steak.
<s> Instantaneous.
<s> Why what?
<s> So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
<s> Stupid.
<s> No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
<s> You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
<s> The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
<s> A wolf without a foot!
<s> Where are you taking me?
<s> You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
<s> All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
<s> I'll come to the wedding.
<s> That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
<s> Marc Chagall. A Russian.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think that's it.
<s> You're late!
<s> Is Johnny here?
<s> Loretta, what are you talking about?
<s> My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
<s> This is a good suit.
<s> You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
<s> Seven-thirty.
<s> A week. Two weeks. No more.
<s> How about a month from today?
<s> You've made me very happy, Johnny.
<s> You have a brother?
<s> We should talk alone.
<s> And who's gonna pay for that?
<s> I got married before, you didn't sell.
<s> I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
<s> Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
<s> No. Are you drunk?
<s> You gotta date?
<s> Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
<s> Where is she?
<s> You're kidding?
<s> That's incredible.
<s> That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
<s> Sure!
<s> I'm not disturbed. By you.
<s> What do you do?
<s> There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
<s> Don't shit where you eat.
<s> Yes.
<s> You mean the whole house?
<s> My God, it's a mansion!
<s> I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
<s> Marriage is happy news.
<s> Is who down there?
<s> Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
<s> I knew she had it.
<s> Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
<s> So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
<s> Does wood sink in water?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Not at all.  They could be carried.
<s> Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
<s> I'm not interested.
<s> But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
<s> I am your king!
<s> You don't vote for kings.
<s> NI!
<s> We want ... a shrubbery!
<s> One that looks nice.
<s> Oh, please!
<s> No, it isn't.
<s> Come on then.
<s> Had enough ... ?
<s> Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
<s> Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
<s> |      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
<s> Just keep me covered.
<s> It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.

<s> Greetings King Arthur.
<s> A G...g...g...
<s> What?
<s> I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
<s> Well ... I AM king.
<s> Yes, I see.
<s> Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
<s> And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
<s> Course it's a good idea.
<s> To find the Holy Grail.
<s> What is your name?
<s> Yes he is.
<s> Farewell, Concorde!
<s> Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
<s> Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
<s> Is it?
<s> What - the curtains?
<s> Leaving the room.
<s> Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
<s> No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
<s> Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
<s> I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
<s> We'll cover your escape!
<s> No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
<s> I don't think I was.
<s> Ector.
<s> Back to your bed!  At once!
<s> I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
<s> Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
<s> Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
<s> Brave, Sir Rob ...
<s> Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
<s> Not down south you don't.
<s> Seventy a year.
<s> How about yourself?
<s> I'm getting dressed.
<s> Oh, I'm much more than that.
<s> You know nothing about her!
<s> It's a diary.
<s> I can't move to tidy.
<s> I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
<s> Mr Brown, sir --
<s> Of course.
<s> A situation?
<s> I'm flattered you think so.
<s> Quite.
<s> I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
<s> Whom you address.
<s> Out of my way!
<s> It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
<s> Back and upper corridors.
<s> How will I know?
<s> That's not good enough.
<s> You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Is that the Queen's request?
<s> She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
<s> Occasionally.
<s> I don't think about it.
<s> I'm not married.
<s> Maybe, once.
<s> I do what I do.
<s> She trusts you, John.
<s> Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
<s> I heard something.
<s> The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
<s> Have I ever let you down before--?
<s> For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
<s> Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
<s> The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
<s> My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
<s> It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
<s> Not too protracted, I hope.
<s> Dear oh dear.
<s> Of course.
<s> Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
<s> Whom?
<s> Cold is good!
<s> Why am I being lectured in this way?!
<s> I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
<s> Just them?
<s> I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
<s> I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
<s> Of course, at once.
<s> No.  I shall be out walking.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
<s> Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
<s> Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
<s> He?
<s> He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
<s> I came from the city on the left.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Hey, kid.
<s> Funny.
<s> Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
<s> It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
<s> Nick, what is it.
<s> ...but then it hits the relay stations...
<s> Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
<s> Drives 'em crazy every time.
<s> Everything.
<s> A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
<s> And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
<s> Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
<s> Right, then...
<s> Check your read-out.
<s> One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
<s> Never been on a snowboard.
<s> In this world, wrong is right!
<s> Is that your question?
<s> You have no time.  What is your question?
<s> Of course I am.
<s> Yes...but...how did you...
<s> Not yet, honey...
<s> That's impossible.
<s> It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
<s> Sign me up.
<s> Give her a chance, will you?
<s> No.
<s> I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
<s> Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
<s> There is no problem.
<s> I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
<s> Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
<s> Yes, he is. He raises corn.
<s> You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
<s> I was afraid of that.
<s> So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
<s> Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
<s> No. I can't.
<s> But it said #12.
<s> She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
<s> Oh...
<s> I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
<s> You don't remember anything else?
<s> Unh, unh.
<s> We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
<s> Come on... let's find you something to wear.
<s> We'll take our check.
<s> "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
<s> "I can call them... I can call my dad... "
<s> "What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
<s> Keep going. Go around to the back.
<s> And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
<s> I just wanted to come here.
<s> This Denny's.
<s> Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
<s> Find out who they are?
<s> Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
<s> Not a coke or anything?
<s> You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
<s> Where's the dock ?
<s> Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
<s> I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
<s> Why should I ?
<s> It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
<s> What ?
<s> I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
<s> NO ! I wouldn't do that.
<s> I'm not listening.
<s> Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
<s> I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
<s> Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
<s> That's a shame.
<s> 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
<s> I don't help criminals.
<s> I'd get out of the water if I were you.
<s> You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
<s> Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
<s> Yes, sir Mom. 
<s> You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
<s> Not yet.
<s> RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
<s> I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
<s> He probably has a history of this shit.
<s> Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
<s> Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
<s> I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
<s> We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
<s> He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
<s> You're paying the bills.
<s> I can see that but where ?
<s> The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
<s> He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
<s> As appealing as that sounds...
<s> Yes, Excuse me for a second.
<s> I just need to sit and think for a second.
<s> I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
<s> Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
<s> Are you writing a poem?
<s> Your Uncle Phil told me.
<s> My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
<s> Don't mention it.
<s> I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
<s> Me, I'll know!
<s> Okay thanks, atta girl.
<s> Well you know what I mean.
<s> No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
<s> No it's okay, I understand, really.
<s> Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
<s> Great.
<s> Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
<s> Thanks, I needed that.
<s> Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
<s> No.
<s> You're being narrow-minded.
<s> Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
<s> I'll try.
<s> Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
<s> Well...
<s> Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
<s> Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
<s> Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
<s> Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
<s> Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
<s> My mother.
<s> Yeah, RIGHT.
<s> WHAT??
<s> Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
<s> Change my name.
<s> This isn't just a mood ring.
<s> Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
<s> Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
<s> I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
<s> DON'T, come on!!!
<s> DON'T!!!
<s> Oh no?!?!?!
<s> No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
<s> You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
<s> I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
<s> 
<s> I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
<s> For the mini-bike fund.
<s> Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
<s> I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
<s> Yes, it does.
<s> I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
<s> Bye.
<s> Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
<s> Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
<s> Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
<s> What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> I was commenting on your hair.
<s> When did you umm, I mean umm...
<s> This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
<s> Yeah, it would be kinda great.
<s> Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
<s> Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
<s> Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
<s> This guy bonking you?
<s> It's her home! It's where she lives!!
<s> Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
<s> Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
<s> What Hurts Vada?
<s> Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
<s> Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
<s> This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
<s> She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
<s> I'm sure she will.
<s> Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
<s> Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
<s> I wrote that.
<s> Did she ever see Vada?
<s> Here?
<s> Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
<s> Want to what?
<s> It's only eight o'clock.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
<s> Really?
<s> I know that, but what do you want from me?
<s> Then who's it for?
<s> You never cared before.
<s> Can I go too?
<s> Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
<s> I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
<s> No sweetheart, you can't.
<s> No, no.
<s> The last date I had was twenty years ago.
<s> Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
<s> It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
<s> Do you think she is?
<s> Why do you think she says that?
<s> Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
<s> Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
<s> Oh.
<s> Well you don't know that. Ask him.
<s> My ball, I lost my ball.
<s> Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
<s> No.
<s> Aarrggh.
<s> This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
<s> Well he just left, what's wrong?
<s> What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
<s> I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
<s> I can't, I have to go home.
<s> Why? It's not dinner time yet.
<s> It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
<s> I'm trying.
<s> You could pick that scab on your arm.
<s> It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
<s> What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
<s> I stopped that!
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> I am running faster!!
<s> I wanna live with them too.
<s> You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
<s> He likes her better than me.
<s> Leave then, some friend you are.
<s> Umm, Ummmmm
<s> Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
<s> I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
<s> ... weeks.
<s> The wandering sportswriter.
<s> Desperate.  To talk.
<s> You've been working on this, huh?
<s> I can't even say it.
<s> What do you suggest?
<s> Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
<s> Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
<s> You need a few dollars.
<s> I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
<s> Can you watch the road?
<s> Which was the disqualifying factor?
<s> ... you hate weddings, you never go.
<s> What? Because I'm a little understand...
<s> So your honeymoon is exactly where?
<s> ... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
<s> It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
<s> Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
<s> Exactly.
<s> What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
<s> I love him.
<s> It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
<s> Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
<s> I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
<s> Well, somet...
<s> Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
<s> ... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
<s> Such as.
<s> Endearingly absent-minded.
<s> Till the gas ran out.
<s> I never eat when I'm serene.
<s> You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
<s> Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
<s> Like I said, dazzling.
<s> Have you.
<s> It's more than that.
<s> I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
<s> Well.
<s> Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
<s> Yes.
<s> ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
<s> Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
<s> You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
<s> Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
<s> A bad combination.
<s> The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
<s> I came here, looking for her.
<s> That is so romantic.
<s> That's little egotistical.
<s> Well, if that's the way you f...
<s> Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
<s> Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
<s> Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
<s> Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
<s> Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
<s> Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
<s> He knows better.
<s> How is that?
<s> They can come to the concert in the park.
<s> Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
<s> Whose?
<s> President.
<s> ABC.
<s> D.C.
<s> Stop it!
<s> How come?
<s> The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
<s> Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
<s> Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
<s> I think we can do that. Come in.
<s> Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
<s> I'm not really a musician.
<s> Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
<s> I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
<s> Replacement party.
<s> A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
<s> No.
<s> I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
<s> He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
<s> Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
<s> When I was little, in church.
<s> About three years.
<s> No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
<s> Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
<s> I've got a gig tonight.
<s> I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
<s> I have to go.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Oh.
<s> What?
<s> Fifteen minutes?
<s> Yea.
<s> I'm sorry but I have to go.
<s> Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
<s> Hello.
<s> He's pretty well known down here.
<s> You're not.
<s> Did it break?
<s> Do you study at all?
<s> Why?
<s> No, we never did that
<s> We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
<s> I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
<s> You think I got any kind of a voice?
<s> Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
<s> Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
<s> We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
<s> What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
<s> Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
<s> I see.
<s> How's it goin'?
<s> Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
<s> What?
<s> Okay, Wayne, step forward.
<s> Tough titty, it's mine now.
<s> How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
<s> All right, Mickey.
<s> Let's do it.
<s> No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
<s> You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
<s> It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
<s> I'm sure we will.
<s> Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
<s> Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
<s> Yeah, we have a van.
<s> Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
<s> No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
<s> They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
<s> Capt'n!
<s> It's hard to say Capt'n.
<s> I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
<s> This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
<s> I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
<s> So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
<s> Wayne---
<s> Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
<s> Really?
<s> Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
<s> Lose 'em.
<s> I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
<s> Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
<s> Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
<s> That'll be thirty-eight cents.
<s> You in a big hurry, boy?
<s> Okay.
<s> Used to be. On the railroad.
<s> Where was that?
<s> Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
<s> 'That right? I thought he was up North.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> No. I'm new in town.
<s> No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
<s> You keep asking me why I'm here.
<s> I like a place with lots of life.
<s> What is it?
<s> It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
<s> You almost got into trouble back there.
<s> Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
<s> 'Been up north?
<s> Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
<s> Are you married?
<s> No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
<s> Four.
<s> I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
<s> I thought you wasn't comin'.
<s> What?
<s> How about it?
<s> Yeah?
<s> He could live with us.
<s> Am I as good as they?
<s> Huh?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
<s> Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
<s> Yeah!
<s> What're you going to do?
<s> I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
<s> When I get set, I'll send for you.
<s> You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
<s> Duff--
<s> Why don't you relax, Frankie?
<s> Take it easy, Frankie.
<s> What 'you signifyin'?
<s> Yeah, see you in hell.
<s> What's eatin' you, Jocko?
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
<s> What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
<s> Okay.
<s> She'll do.
<s> I said, she's in great shape.
<s> Whenever he's got an edge on.
<s> Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
<s> I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
<s> I guess not.
<s> It ain't in me.
<s> I guess I'll rob a bank.
<s> I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
<s> What's the matter?! You mad at me?
<s> What's the matter now?
<s> That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
<s> My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
<s> He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
<s> They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
<s> Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
<s> First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
<s> Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
<s> The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
<s> It hasn't yet.
<s> Dixie McCoy
<s> I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
<s> You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
<s> Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
<s> You'll be linked during the entire operation.
<s> He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
<s> We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
<s> This ain't Bangkok, chief.
<s> I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
<s> Are you even really alive?
<s> The words?
<s> It's Case. Remember me?
<s> As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
<s> That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
<s> Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
<s> What?
<s> Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
<s> We got problems topside.
<s> You can make your move when it comes after me.
<s> How's the ice break?
<s> It's coming.
<s> What?
<s> There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
<s> You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
<s> I think you're full of shit.
<s> Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
<s> I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
<s> Couple of days. They'll examine you.
<s> Won't that mean you're dead?
<s> Dixie McCoy didn't.
<s> Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
<s> Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
<s> Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
<s> Something exotic I hope.
<s> Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Petty good.
<s> This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
<s> That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
<s> Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
<s> Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
<s> I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
<s> OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
<s> You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
<s> Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
<s> The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
<s> Sometimes opposites attract.
<s> Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
<s> A flack jacket.
<s> Oh. Right.
<s> I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
<s> He's my teacher!
<s> I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
<s> Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
<s> I'm Rob's prom date.
<s> You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
<s> Yes, desperately.
<s> Better than I...
<s> With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
<s> Rufus?
<s> wasn't even thinking about-
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
<s> I know.
<s> I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
<s> But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
<s> To put us back together again when we fall.
<s> What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
<s> It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
<s> You were attracted to me?
<s> Wait, I was going to tell you--
<s> But now you don't have to--
<s> I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
<s> I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
<s> I finally found my story.
<s> It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
<s> Maybe we should sit.
<s> Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
<s> Lock.
<s> <i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
<s> I know.
<s> I can't help it.
<s> Good.  I'm hungry.
<s> Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
<s> <i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<s> Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
<s> It's not the gas, Dad!
<s> And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
<s> Oh, please...
<s> I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
<s> Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
<s> I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
<s> Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
<s> Yeah, yeah, sure.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Traumas of a ten-year old.
<s> Wow...
<s> Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
<s> Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
<s> Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know - a sharp pain.
<s> Why won't you talk to me?
<s> We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
<s> You okay?
<s> No.  I'm okay.
<s> Thanks, Mom.
<s> Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
<s> They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
<s> Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
<s> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
<s> Mom?
<s> I had such an awful dream.
<s> Don't hold your breath.
<s> Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
<s> Do you still...see each other?
<s> It's an amazing gift.
<s> Sure.
<s> I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
<s> He's heavy in the halls...
<s> I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
<s> So?
<s> A little basic, but nice.
<s> It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
<s> Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
<s> You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
<s> Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
<s> Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
<s> You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
<s> So do I.
<s> I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
<s> Try me.
<s> Remember -- open mind.
<s> Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
<s> They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Mary Helena.
<s> Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
<s> Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
<s> There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
<s> Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
<s> Where...here?
<s> I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
<s> Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
<s> Thanks.  I'll think about it.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Really, no.
<s> I forgot my bag.
<s> Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
<s> No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
<s> You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
<s> That's fine.
<s> You abide by rules like that?
<s> What did you say?
<s> She left me.
<s> Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
<s> Well, get a message through to him too.
<s> You have a stunt bottom?
<s> The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
<s> But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
<s> Stay forever.
<s> You do?
<s> Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
<s> I only found out you were here yesterday.
<s> Hello.
<s> I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
<s> That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
<s> Who is it?
<s> Nice surprise.
<s> Yes.
<s> He wouldn't say.
<s> Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
<s> Yes, I think that one may be.
<s> Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
<s> Shame!
<s> No -- it's my 22nd.
<s> Well, yes.  Groovy.
<s> William has just turned down Anna Scott.
<s> How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
<s> Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
<s> Any bit in particular?
<s> But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
<s> I think you do, yes.
<s> Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
<s> That's not fair.
<s> May I help you, sir?
<s> I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
<s> Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
<s> Hi...
<s> So -- any messages?
<s> Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
<s> Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
<s> Why not?
<s> Three.
<s> So?
<s> Yes, that's perfectly correct.
<s> I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
<s> Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
<s> Mister Sefelt?
<s> I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
<s> I-I-I...
<s> You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
<s> No! No! No!
<s> Thank you, ma'am...
<s> Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
<s> Yes, Mister McMurphy?
<s> You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
<s> Go on...
<s> Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
<s> Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
<s> Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
<s> Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
<s> I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
<s> He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
<s> He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
<s> Please see to Mister Bromden.
<s> Yes, Miss Ratched...
<s> Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
<s> Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
<s> Wh-wh-wh-wh...
<s> Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
<s> C-C-C-C-Candy!
<s> Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
<s> M-M-M-Mack?
<s> Thank you.
<s> God Bless America.
<s> No.
<s> Ca-na-da...
<s> Are they all crazies?
<s> Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
<s> It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
<s> Yeah, Mack, what is it?
<s> Me, too...
<s> What?
<s> A pecking party?
<s> Now, what would I be trying to say?
<s> A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
<s> I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
<s> What for?
<s> Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
<s> I refuse!
<s> Sure, Mack...
<s> No!
<s> I'm not running a charity ward...
<s> Yesterday...
<s> Can you borrow me a dime?
<s> What's this?
<s> Hit me.
<s> A nickel.
<s> No! I wanna go!
<s> I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
<s> Yeah, it's cold!
<s> What is it?
<s> In what way?
<s> Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
<s> Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
<s> Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
<s> We'll let you know.
<s> What's the horse pill for, honey?
<s> Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
<s> Are you a doctor?
<s> Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
<s> You're on!
<s> I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
<s> Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
<s> Sure...
<s> He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
<s> Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
<s> To help you relax... please...
<s> Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
<s> Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
<s> What?
<s> P.A. What the hell is that?
<s> Bet you ass...
<s> Take you han's offa me!
<s> No way...
<s> Yes, ma'am...
<s> Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
<s> Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
<s> You ol' fucker!
<s> Oh, yeah...
<s> I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
<s> Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
<s> I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
<s> It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Your great aunt.
<s> Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
<s> No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
<s> Hm.
<s> I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
<s> I'm in love with you.
<s> NO.
<s> Yes.
<s> He's safe.
<s> Because I don't have the right name?!
<s> Well, good.  Good for you.
<s> I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
<s> No.  Course not.
<s> In that case... no...
<s> You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
<s> I would call it-- unforgivable.
<s> Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
<s> That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
<s> Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
<s> Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
<s> I don't know, Kate.
<s> Yes you did.
<s> Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
<s> No...  I can just tell.
<s> What about your job?
<s> Does Dwayne know about this?
<s> My God, you have...
<s> How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
<s> Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
<s> Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
<s> Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
<s> So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
<s> You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
<s> Larry bought himself cologne?
<s> You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
<s> I meant about my idea.
<s> Packing.
<s> I know, but...
<s> ...and a fortune teller.
<s> The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
<s> He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
<s> My God... you're right.
<s> No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
<s> I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
<s> Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
<s> Yup.
<s> Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
<s> I'd love to.
<s> Oh.
<s> You don't have to go if you don't want to...
<s> You used to love it when I called you doll.
<s> What?  You know him?
<s> She's not here.
<s> That's really romantic.
<s> He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
<s> I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
<s> So do I, Charley. For your sake.
<s> Then don't.
<s> Maybe he gave them an argument.
<s> But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
<s> Nolan? I knew he had guts but
<s> The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
<s> They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
<s> Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
<s> I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
<s> Don't say that!
<s> Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
<s> Why Edie, I
<s> Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
<s> Hello, Edie.
<s> Give it to me my Pop's job
<s> Which side are you with?
<s> I'll get home all right now.
<s> Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
<s> Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh she's a beauty.
<s> In a saloon?
<s> Hit me again, Mac.
<s> I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
<s> What a fruitcake you are!
<s> What do they do for you, except get in your way?
<s> All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
<s> It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
<s> Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
<s> I can't let myself fall in love with you.
<s> I just told the Father.
<s> I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
<s> I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
<s> Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
<s> Terry...?
<s> And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
<s> You are like
<s> I'll find you a priest.
<s> Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
<s> What do you want from me, Father.
<s> You go to
<s> Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
<s> I can? Okay.  Okay...
<s> Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
<s> Are you on the level, Father?
<s> Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
<s> Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.
<s> What about it?
<s> We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
<s> Take it easy.
<s> You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
<s> You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
<s> I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Raise a hand to me and... .
<s> You'd be off the pier for good.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
<s> Be sure they got enough water.
<s> Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
<s> Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
<s> Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
<s> Yeah us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
<s> But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
<s> Take it easy now, Terry.
<s> Hey look-
<s> Forty-five bills.
<s> Gimme.
<s> Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this  to remember them by.
<s> By way of Chicago?
<s> How'd you get that.
<s> Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
<s> Go on, beat it!
<s> Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
<s> Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
<s> That's life.  My kisses are alive.
<s> Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
<s> It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
<s> I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
<s> I'm afraid I'll faint.
<s> Of course I do.
<s> A situation easily remedied.
<s> She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
<s> Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
<s> At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
<s> Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
<s> Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
<s> For what!?!
<s> I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
<s> Aaarrrgggaahh.
<s> Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
<s> Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
<s> They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
<s> He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
<s> Thank you.
<s> His assistant.
<s> That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
<s> She's coming with us.
<s> The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
<s> There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
<s> Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
<s> Her phone's probably tapped.
<s> They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
<s> Forty-five minutes.
<s> Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
<s> Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
<s> You know how I felt about her.
<s> I don't ski.
<s> You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
<s> Shit.
<s> And then they'll kill 'em.
<s> Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
<s> In the trunk, yeah?
<s> It was an unusual experience.
<s> Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
<s> What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
<s> Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
<s> I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
<s> I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
<s> Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
<s> Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
<s> I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
<s> No, I didn't know that.
<s> Let's go outside and talk.
<s> Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
<s> That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
<s> Someone down here?
<s> You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
<s> Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
<s> Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
<s> Of course I am.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
<s> It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
<s> Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
<s> Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
<s> Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
<s> I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
<s> I just thought maybe you and me could--
<s> What, as a sales rep?
<s> I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
<s> I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
<s> Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
<s> You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
<s> What's to think about?
<s> I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
<s> Five point two.
<s> If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
<s> I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
<s> Yeah.  That was the ninth.
<s> Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
<s> Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
<s> It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
<s> I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
<s> If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
<s> Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
<s> Oh...
<s> You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
<s> What do you want?
<s> You not with probation, one of those?
<s> You a lawyer?
<s> He said he stayed here last November.
<s> What did you call it?
<s> It's a --
<s> You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
<s> That's right, just me.
<s> I don't have any idea.
<s> No.  Course not.
<s> I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
<s> Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
<s> You mean hiding them?
<s> That's me, Sir.
<s> Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
<s> You liked that?
<s> Sir?
<s> A m-missionary?
<s> Well, you p-puked on his feet.
<s> You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
<s> Power dive!
<s> The Colonel helped me work it out.
<s> I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
<s> It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
<s> So what are you saying?
<s> You left her.  How's that for a fact?
<s> I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
<s> Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
<s> Six P-40's.
<s> Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
<s> Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
<s> Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
<s> They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
<s> Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
<s> He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
<s> Well...sure.
<s> Thank you, Sir.
<s> Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
<s> Yes'm.
<s> You too, 'Mam.
<s> But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
<s> I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
<s> Brilliant, Admiral.
<s> So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
<s> I'm not telling.
<s> I can't. It's all too much.
<s> That loudmouthed little bitch~
<s> What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
<s> Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
<s> I'm not going.
<s> Refresh my memory.
<s> They'll learn to live with it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Rejected, worthless, miserable.
<s> You're pretty charming when you want to be.
<s> You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
<s> Nothing.. Selling is selling.
<s> What am I going to do with you?
<s> Let's go down to the basement.
<s> Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
<s> Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
<s> If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
<s> You're going to listen to me.
<s> I'm trying.
<s> Test?
<s> First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
<s> Touchy, touchy!
<s> What, why?
<s> That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
<s> My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
<s> He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
<s> She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
<s> A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
<s> For everyone.
<s> Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
<s> It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
<s> Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
<s> I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
<s> Of course, dear. You're home now.
<s> Oh. I forgot.
<s> It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
<s> It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Way to go, Mom!
<s> Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
<s> Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
<s> Rosalie Testa!
<s> Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
<s> What's that?
<s> How, did you know about my grandfather?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Am I dead or not?
<s> I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
<s> How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
<s> Wbat're you talking about?
<s> Come on. You can't be serious.
<s> Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
<s> All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
<s> High tech. I like the sound of that.
<s> Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
<s> Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
<s> Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
<s> We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
<s> No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
<s> You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
<s> The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
<s> I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
<s> I suppose so.
<s> Yes... why?
<s> He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
<s> Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
<s> Sure.
<s> Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
<s> I'm going out, Dad!
<s> Zowie.
<s> I'm not burying him here...
<s> What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
<s> Yeah...
<s> I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
<s> Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
<s> Andy?
<s> Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
<s> Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
<s> A reaction to AZT...
<s> He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
<s> You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
<s> Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
<s> If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
<s> Don't do this, Andy.
<s> I'm seeing him this afternoon.
<s> About my blood work?
<s> Defined by Webster's as harmless.
<s> One week old.
<s> Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
<s> Continue.
<s> Makeup.
<s> Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
<s> Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
<s> Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
<s> I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
<s> Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
<s> Uh huh...
<s> What have you prayed for?
<s> Want to hear my favorite aria?
<s> I suppose you could say that.
<s> Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
<s> It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
<s> Sure thing.
<s> Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
<s> I guess it was 1984, 85.
<s> It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Hi, Mom. It's me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
<s> I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
<s> I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
<s> I'm not worried. What are you doing?
<s> Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
<s> Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
<s> Get real.
<s> Uh.... No. Not really.
<s> I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
<s> In a word, yes.
<s> But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
<s> Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
<s> What kind of people?
<s> Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
<s> Give me the camera, Joe.
<s> Okay, Joe...
<s> Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
<s> But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
<s> By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
<s> Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
<s> With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
<s> Dr. J.!
<s> Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
<s> You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
<s> Jesus.
<s> Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
<s> Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
<s> <u>What</u>?
<s> It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
<s> Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
<s> Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
<s> Saw something I didn't like.
<s> Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
<s> You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
<s> I can't....I can't....
<s> Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
<s> We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
<s> Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
<s> Probably right.
<s> So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
<s> Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
<s> Shut up.
<s> Like what?
<s> I assume he licked it clean.
<s> <u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
<s> He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
<s> I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
<s> We're just burnin' light here.
<s> Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
<s> Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
<s> What, you're goin' off, too?
<s> Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
<s> So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
<s> 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
<s> One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
<s> And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
<s> The child heard you before any of us could even....
<s> Please...this solves nothing...please....
<s> He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
<s> Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
<s> Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
<s> We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
<s> Said "looks clear."
<s> Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
<s> Nice embellishment.
<s> You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
<s> We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
<s> To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
<s> Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
<s> Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
<s> Good luck then.
<s> The evidence was very meager --
<s> Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
<s> Blessed are the vegetarians.
<s> These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
<s> What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
<s> Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
<s> Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
<s> Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
<s> He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
<s> You don't seem very cut up about it.
<s> Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
<s> Don't bother
<s> Try telling them our names.
<s> Zira doesn't want your female.
<s> In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
<s> What is it?
<s> Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
<s> My name is Taylor.
<s> Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
<s> Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
<s> I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
<s> When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
<s> Shhhh!
<s> Taylor, please --
<s> He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
<s> Why not?
<s> Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
<s> I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
<s> Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
<s> He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
<s> Where?
<s> He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
<s> Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
<s> Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
<s> Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
<s> Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
<s> Over here!
<s> Yeah.
<s> She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
<s> Barnes believes in what he's doing.
<s> In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
<s> Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
<s> Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
<s> Nah...
<s> This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
<s> ...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
<s> I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
<s> If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
<s> Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
<s> These two holes are yours...
<s> That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
<s> This is one time we could sure use Elias.
<s> My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
<s> I see.
<s> What did you say his name was?
<s> Sure... but somebody always does..
<s> No thanks.
<s> I'm different. I like it fine.
<s> Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
<s> I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
<s> No percentage in that.
<s> But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
<s> I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
<s> I'm sorry, that's all there is.
<s> Who told you I was married?
<s> Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
<s> Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
<s> The police always do, don't they?
<s> You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
<s> There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
<s> What does he see?
<s> What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
<s> Morning. Any calls?
<s> All right. Get him.
<s> You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
<s> Got the information on you?
<s> I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
<s> A private joke.
<s> You're not English.
<s> Yes, I've seen it before.
<s> On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
<s> I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
<s> Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
<s> If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
<s> Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
<s> How would you know, Brandon?
<s> I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
<s> Would you?
<s> Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
<s> You get it's brother.
<s> They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
<s> So the shell ought to have gone over?
<s> So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
<s> I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
<s> I think so.
<s> If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
<s> Pretty big chance, huh?
<s> And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
<s> I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
<s> That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
<s> Not if it clears the air.
<s> You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
<s> How about Magruder?
<s> We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
<s> Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
<s> Years, why?
<s> You already have the checks, darling.
<s> How about your new friend?
<s> A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
<s> It's kind of you to see me.
<s> What a shame.
<s> Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
<s> Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
<s> Penfield.  James Penfield.
<s> I see.
<s> No.  I'd want to--
<s> Thank you.
<s> Freshman and sophomores...
<s> No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
<s> Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
<s> Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
<s> Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
<s> I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
<s> To the airlift.
<s> Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
<s> Let me see.
<s> You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
<s> We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
<s> On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
<s> She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
<s> Have you come to talk about me?
<s> That's good.
<s> No, thanks Dad.
<s> She said that?
<s> And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
<s> You'd look naked without one.
<s> I won't.  Goodnight.
<s> Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
<s> Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
<s> Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
<s> Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
<s> You do it... you first!
<s> Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
<s> See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
<s> What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
<s> SHIT!!
<s> I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
<s> Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
<s> What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
<s> Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
<s> Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
<s> The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
<s> Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
<s> Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
<s> Got it...
<s> Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
<s> This Zen master surfer.
<s> Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
<s> Figured you did.
<s> Kid, get outta the way!!
<s> Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
<s> Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
<s> Sure.
<s> He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
<s> What?
<s> I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
<s> Warm them up.
<s> Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
<s> Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
<s> Tyler, put the gun down.
<s> Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
<s> No way, old buddy.
<s> You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
<s> The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
<s> Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
<s> I'll take him.
<s> That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
<s> He knows our defenses.
<s> No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
<s> No.
<s> Who indeed...
<s> How are you, Mr. Kross.
<s> Yes.
<s> How?
<s> Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
<s> Sit... and spin.
<s> What motel you staying at?
<s> Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
<s> You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
<s> Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
<s> You mean they don't have hookers.
<s> If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
<s> Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
<s> I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
<s> Mmm, I could tell.
<s> What?
<s> Of course.  How much?
<s> No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
<s> Any good?
<s> You're forgiven.
<s> Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
<s> Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
<s> Good.
<s> Dinner can wait.
<s> He died a long time ago.
<s> Ready to stomp sod?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
<s> Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
<s> Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
<s> I more than liked it.
<s> Did you?
<s> When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
<s> It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
<s> Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
<s> Vivian...
<s> Thank you.
<s> Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
<s> Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
<s> I'm here.
<s> Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
<s> Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
<s> But, Edward...
<s> Yes...
<s> Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
<s> Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
<s> Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
<s> Let him answer.
<s> And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
<s> Yes.
<s> I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
<s> Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
<s> Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
<s> I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
<s> I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
<s> In Beverly Hills?
<s> Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
<s> Kit give me nothin'.
<s> Of rent I do not bullshit.
<s> I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
<s> I leave extras, miss.
<s> But what if they serve soup?
<s> Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
<s> I'm just looking, thanks.
<s> I just might do that.
<s> Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
<s> So it's to be torture.
<s> May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
<s> I swear it will be done.
<s> I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
<s> Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
<s> Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
<s> I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
<s> You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
<s> And what am I?
<s> As you wish.
<s> This is true love. You think this happens every day?
<s> You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
<s> Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
<s> It never happened.
<s> I believe you -- So what happens now?
<s> What do I do?
<s> That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
<s> -- what? --
<s> But you don't know where he is.
<s> Everybody ... MOVE!!
<s> Where did you get that?
<s> What?
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
<s> -- murdered by pirates is good --
<s> Do you want me to go on with this?
<s> You want me to read this or not?
<s> Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
<s> Okay.
<s> My spy network has heard no such news.
<s> It won't be easy, Sire.
<s> I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
<s> DEATH FIRST!!
<s> I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
<s> And our assets?
<s> I thought he was with you.
<s> -- power too -- promise me that --
<s> I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
<s> He's already dead.
<s> Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
<s> Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
<s> Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
<s> And what is that?
<s> Get used to disappointment.
<s> That would be inconceivable.
<s> No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
<s> Inconceivable!
<s> Oh, have it your way.
<s> Hmm.
<s> You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
<s> Don't say another word, Valerie.
<s> I'm not listening.
<s> I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
<s> That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
<s> "To my honey I'll croon,
<s> Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
<s> Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
<s> It's nothing ... nothing.
<s> Mr. Bialystock ...
<s> All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
<s> Oh, it's all right ... wha?
<s> You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
<s> Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
<s> Exactly.  And how long did it run?
<s> You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
<s> Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
<s> They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
<s> I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
<s> Leo, what if this play is a hit?
<s> I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
<s> Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
<s> He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
<s> Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
<s> Yes.
<s> All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
<s> Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
<s> I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
<s> No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
<s> Here I come, ready or not.
<s> Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
<s> We can't play today?
<s> Of Siegfried...
<s> Wagner...
<s> And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
<s> "Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
<s> What have you done, LSD?
<s> No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
<s> Send for Goebbels.
<s> Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
<s> Or arrived with her.
<s> And when she left, she never came back.
<s> Anyone at home?
<s> Someone is sitting in that window.
<s> If she paid you well?
<s> I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
<s> She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
<s> No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
<s> Of course not. Please.
<s> Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
<s> How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
<s> With the forty thousand dollars?
<s> May I talk to you?
<s> Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
<s> Huh?
<s> I hate tears. 
<s> I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
<s> She'll need both of us.
<s> Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
<s> Are we just going to go on sitting here?
<s> Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
<s> Where's the old highway?
<s> Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
<s> An hour! Or less!
<s> Sam, I'm going.
<s> Just wait here?
<s> Sam.
<s> Who's he?
<s> Does that mean we can't...
<s> I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
<s> Neither will I.
<s> I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
<s> I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
<s> It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
<s> I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
<s> Sam, let's go get married.
<s> I thought I'd gotten off the main...
<s> The bathroom.
<s> Thank you. Again.
<s> No.
<s> Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
<s> It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
<s> I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
<s> To a private island, like you?
<s> Good night.
<s> Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
<s> Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
<s> Why?
<s> At this hour?
<s> Mother, please...
<s> He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
<s> You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
<s> Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
<s> Did I?
<s> Indeed, he has often told me.
<s> Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
<s> Why didn't you notify the police?
<s> Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
<s> You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
<s> By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
<s> Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
<s> A voice ...
<s> Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
<s> No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
<s> I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
<s> No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
<s> Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
<s> Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
<s> I'd call it stupid at any time.
<s> So that's the way it is?
<s> It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
<s> And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
<s> I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
<s> You mean he was colored?
<s> Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
<s> And they never proved anything against him.
<s> Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
<s> I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
<s> Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
<s> Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
<s> Where were you going when you got in that cab?
<s> Old Howard Winton's cub?
<s> They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
<s> There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
<s> Horsefeathers!
<s> I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
<s> For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
<s> We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
<s> Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
<s> Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
<s> Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
<s> No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
<s> Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
<s> Yes.
<s> They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
<s> Excuse me???
<s> Yes....
<s> What universe are you in, Paul?
<s> Then you get it.  You'll understand.
<s> But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
<s> Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
<s> You were pretty bad, huh?
<s> But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
<s> But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
<s> Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
<s> You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
<s> Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
<s> Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
<s> I said I wouldn't.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
<s> What was your mother like?
<s> Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
<s> Well, it's not very plain.
<s> No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
<s> You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
<s> What did you say, Brother?
<s> No, you didn't say that, Brother.
<s> She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
<s> No.
<s> I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
<s> They're discussing it.
<s> Boy! Wow!
<s> Then why does she act so dumb?
<s> Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
<s> Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
<s> A wonderful woman, boy.
<s> I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
<s> Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
<s> I think we both know her.
<s> What?
<s> Oh. Did you say something?
<s> And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
<s> There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
<s> You're not having lunch?
<s> Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
<s> Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
<s> Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
<s> Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
<s> She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
<s> Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
<s> Who?
<s> Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
<s> No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
<s> Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
<s> Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
<s> He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
<s> Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
<s> Tennessee?
<s> No, you're not.
<s> Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
<s> Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
<s> Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
<s> Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
<s> Gonorrhea?
<s> What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
<s> Illusions, Madam?
<s> Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
<s> But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
<s> Oh, Mother, cut it out.
<s> Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
<s> Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
<s> I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
<s> Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
<s> You're not gonna see him again.
<s> Incestuous.
<s> What and?  That's what I got.
<s> Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
<s> Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
<s> I don't know.  Fuck off!
<s> If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
<s> Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
<s> Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
<s> Relax.
<s> Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
<s> Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
<s> Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
<s> Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
<s> Entertainers don't count.
<s> You don't smoke.
<s> It's just the way things are, kiddo.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
<s> Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
<s> Follow me.
<s> We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
<s> There probably is.
<s> You going rogue on me?
<s> What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
<s> Murderer?  Really?
<s> Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
<s> You are such a disappointment, Benny.
<s> You know... you could say thank you.
<s> What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
<s> Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
<s> All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
<s> Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
<s> Dead.
<s> Just got here.
<s> Who is that... ?
<s> Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
<s> Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
<s> We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
<s> Yoda spoke of another.
<s> She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
<s> You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
<s> It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
<s> Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
<s> Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
<s> There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
<s> Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
<s> I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
<s> All set.
<s> Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
<s> Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
<s> Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
<s> You, too.
<s> I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
<s> Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
<s> Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
<s> He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
<s> Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
<s> Your father?
<s> You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
<s> Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
<s> Your father he is.
<s> I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
<s> I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
<s> Rocky!
<s> Janet.
<s> Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
<s> Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
<s> For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
<s> Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
<s> It's alright Janet.
<s> It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
<s> So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
<s> A decision had to be made.
<s> Cross my heart and hope to die.
<s> Makes you cry
<s> So come up to the Lab.
<s> Like I'm outside in the rain
<s> Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
<s> Oh no no no no.
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
<s> No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
<s> And our World will do the Time Warp again.
<s> ...I'm sorry.
<s> ...I don't know.
<s> Ohh!
<s> By accident?
<s> It doesn't bother me either.
<s> I think he might be worried.
<s> It's fine.
<s> I don't think I belong here.
<s> ...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
<s> Don't tease me.
<s> I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
<s> Sharp -- Real nice.
<s> No... Sharp -- You look great.
<s> Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
<s> Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
<s> Apollo?
<s> Don't say that.
<s> Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
<s> Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
<s> Christ.
<s> It's not your house --
<s> ...I don't feel heat from the name.
<s> Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
<s> Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
<s> One more round.
<s> ...Thanks.
<s> Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
<s> Fouls.
<s> No wine.
<s> Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
<s> Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
<s> Charge it.
<s> There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
<s> Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
<s> Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
<s> ...Fine.
<s> Gonna try.
<s> No action.
<s> Sparrin'?
<s> Stuff it, man!
<s> ...Yeah.
<s> I won't.
<s> I said, how ya feelin'?
<s> Yeah --
<s> Message -- What message?
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Freak luck is a strange thing.
<s> Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
<s> Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
<s> I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
<s> Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
<s> Damn! How's it look?
<s> Fine... That guy's great.
<s> It ain't your locker no more.
<s> He ain't losin' nothin'.
<s> Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
<s> Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
<s> Absolutely...
<s> I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
<s> Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
<s> Maybe ya better forget it.
<s> ...No.
<s> Gazzo's a good man.
<s> Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
<s> ...It's cold outside, Paulie.
<s> ...People talk to me more.
<s> Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
<s> C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
<s> You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
<s> Check the scrawl.
<s> What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
<s> <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
<s> Maroon, right?
<s> He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
<s> The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
<s> It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
<s> That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
<s> Surprised?
<s> Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
<s> That's because I don't have a doorbell.
<s> Toons aren't given imperfections.
<s> We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
<s> He's right here in the...
<s> Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
<s> So what do you want me to do?
<s> As soon as is humanly possible.
<s> I've already seen your photographs.
<s> Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
<s> Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
<s> Aah!
<s> Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
<s> Yeah, that's better.
<s> Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
<s> Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
<s> A Toon?  Noooo.
<s> Safe?
<s> How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
<s> I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
<s> Uh? Uh?
<s> Leave Me!
<s> Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
<s> Romeo will answer it?
<s> Am I like Such a fellow?
<s> She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
<s> Teach me how I should forget to think.
<s> I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
<s> I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
<s> Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
<s> And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
<s> O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
<s> Madam, in happy time what day is that?
<s> Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
<s> Madam, I am here. What is your will?
<s> Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
<s> By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
<s> Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
<s> Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
<s> Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
<s> Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
<s> Ahhh!
<s> With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
<s> If my heart's dear love--
<s> The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
<s> I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
<s> Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
<s> Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
<s> Well, what was yours?
<s> Thou hast most kindly hit it.
<s> Right.
<s> Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
<s> Could you not take some occasion without giving?
<s> What?
<s> Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
<s> So where do you go from here?
<s> And who are you?
<s> The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
<s> Best beer in the world known to man or God.
<s> I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
<s> It's been known to happen.
<s> You lose them!
<s> Not yet...
<s> I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Nobody's saying they don't.
<s> Duty calls?
<s> Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
<s> Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
<s> Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
<s> Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
<s> You sure about this?
<s> You first, Edvard.
<s> He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
<s> I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
<s> A post office box.
<s> It's done.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
<s> Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
<s> Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
<s> Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
<s> Not for long.
<s> My way is better.
<s> Who's they?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I know cops -- and you're no cop.
<s> No thanks.
<s> I asked if we could give him anything else.
<s> I wanted to see who you were.
<s> I just wanted to see something.
<s> Because that's what I would have done...
<s> Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
<s> I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
<s> No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
<s> If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
<s> I know of him.
<s> Very ugly.
<s> You think?
<s> Right now?
<s> Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
<s> Business keeps you on the road?
<s> So I do it.
<s> What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
<s> Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
<s> What of it?
<s> You better get some sleep, alright?
<s> Gone.  Destroyed.
<s> You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
<s> A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
<s> Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
<s> I want to get some hounds down here.
<s> Sure thing, and --
<s> I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
<s> Seven thousand...
<s> Why?  Are you kidding me?
<s> Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
<s> We'll figure something out.
<s> Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
<s> What makes you so sure?
<s> What's that?
<s> What are you gonna do?
<s> I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
<s> Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
<s> He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
<s> What are you thinking?
<s> Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
<s> For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
<s> I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
<s> You killed him...
<s> Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
<s> He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
<s> No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Two thousand...
<s> No.  Why?
<s> What's that?
<s> What for?
<s> I might have to look into that...
<s> I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
<s> You deserve it is the occasion.
<s> Nothing happened?
<s> Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
<s> I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
<s> What?
<s> How about you give us what you have and leave.
<s> This just might be our ticket!
<s> Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
<s> Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
<s> Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
<s> Lingerie...
<s> Well I just uh, you know...
<s> Hmmm...
<s> Have I seen her?
<s> Uh...C?
<s> Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
<s> He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
<s> Take it or leave it.
<s> Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
<s> I didn't say that.  You did.
<s> Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
<s> Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
<s> Dwayne -
<s> Well you're not getting, either.
<s> Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
<s> I was in the neighborhood.
<s> Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
<s> Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
<s> And what happened?
<s> I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
<s> I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
<s> Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
<s> Is this about the funny money?
<s> El Capitan?
<s> I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
<s> We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
<s> It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
<s> It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
<s> That's right.
<s> I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
<s> Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
<s> That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
<s> Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
<s> Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
<s> Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
<s> This won't take long.
<s> Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
<s> How you doin'?
<s> Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
<s> I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
<s> No.  She's a school teacher.
<s> I cannot go to LA...
<s> Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
<s> He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
<s> Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
<s> Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
<s> What is it?
<s> I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
<s> Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
<s> I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
<s> There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
<s> No mu-shu.
<s> Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
<s> Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
<s> End of the line.
<s> Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
<s> What?!?!
<s> Fine with me.
<s> I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
<s> Why don't you go get them?
<s> Baby Duck?
<s> I still have my lunch money from third grade.
<s> Any leads?
<s> It's my responsibility.
<s> That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
<s> This is pathetic.
<s> You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
<s> Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
<s> Witnesses.
<s> You don't know what a shortcut is?
<s> No.
<s> Did you make the plate?!
<s> Took off. Yes. They took off.
<s> Yeah, it's good.
<s> No, fish is a PM food.
<s> Going into the restaurant.
<s> I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
<s> It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
<s> What?
<s> No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
<s> Where'd you get it?
<s> Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
<s> The Feds?!
<s> You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
<s> Don't play bullshit games with me.
<s> And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
<s> Do it!
<s> You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
<s> Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
<s> Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
<s> I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
<s> You bet ya, Coach.
<s> How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
<s> What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
<s> Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
<s> Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
<s> Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
<s> "Never say die."
<s> Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
<s> That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
<s> Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
<s> I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
<s> No.  No, you didn't.
<s> Where do you think she's going?
<s> Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
<s> It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
<s> Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
<s> Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
<s> And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
<s> Unbelievable, she got to you.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
<s> Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
<s> -- The luau for Maggie.
<s> Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
<s> Without oxygen...
<s> You can turn that finger around.
<s> Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
<s> Of course.
<s> No.  You take it.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Or the sexual habits of locusts?
<s> That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
<s> A little longer for me.
<s> I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
<s> Me?
<s> "I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
<s> She's the boss.
<s> He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
<s> On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
<s> Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
<s> ... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
<s> Not eight...
<s> I'm just finishing up, too.
<s> Quick.  Very quick.
<s> Good boy, Port Hole.
<s> I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What am I going to do with a microwave?
<s> My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
<s> Does it have wheat in it?
<s> Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
<s> No.
<s> It was my mother's.
<s> At the top of the Empire State Building --
<s> Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
<s> What?
<s> That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
<s> "I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
<s> Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
<s> I always wondered about that too.
<s> I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
<s> I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
<s> It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
<s> I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
<s> You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
<s> Mom, we already...
<s> It's a sign.
<s> She died.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
<s> Right, right.
<s> I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
<s> H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> I don't know.  Do I?
<s> What is it?
<s> My feelings exactly.
<s> Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
<s> Stressed.
<s> I know.
<s> What was?
<s> I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
<s> I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
<s> Now I'm late.  Bye.
<s> Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
<s> Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
<s> I was thirsty.
<s> No.
<s> I just called for a second.
<s> Victoria? She's okay.
<s> Who is Annie?
<s> This conversation is finished.
<s> Did not.
<s> Goddammit, I am sick of this --
<s> Microwave.  Five minutes.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You did?
<s> You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
<s> No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
<s> Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
<s> There's nothing stopping you.
<s> It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
<s> Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
<s> With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
<s> What's more important than sanitation?
<s> I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
<s> What has it got me, your union?
<s> He was born fighting. And born hungry.
<s> They say I am no good to you.
<s> Over my dead body.
<s> No.
<s> The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
<s> Can be what?
<s> I've had them since the day they were born.
<s> I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
<s> No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
<s> Hunting.
<s> Why not? I'm not needed here.
<s> Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
<s> Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
<s> Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
<s> Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
<s> New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
<s> It's possible. Just negotiate.
<s> Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
<s> Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
<s> Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
<s> That's it?
<s> Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
<s> How about in the house?
<s> Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
<s> Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
<s> Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
<s> Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
<s> Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
<s> Then leave.
<s> Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
<s> And you admire that?
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> You don't like the tune, find another station.
<s> It's me.
<s> What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
<s> They would have killed you too.
<s> Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
<s> It's Tom.
<s> I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
<s> It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
<s> Guess it's our turn.
<s> You don't say.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
<s> Can your man handle that?
<s> You mean, like to throw 'em off?
<s> John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
<s> Yes, Jimmy
<s> Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
<s> You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
<s> I can't tell you.
<s> Anything for a dear friend.
<s> Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
<s> Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
<s> Tell me what?
<s> Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
<s> This chink have a name?
<s> I'm afraid so, Danny.
<s> Yeah.
<s> My name is Tom.
<s> And what does this have to do with me?
<s> Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
<s> I still don't know what you're talking about.
<s> And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
<s> What if he caps me before you can make a move?
<s> Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
<s> Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
<s> It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
<s> Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> That is so unfair.
<s> I thought you were done.
<s> Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
<s> A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
<s> It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
<s> The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
<s> What deal?
<s> In the shadow by those two trees.
<s> Gives Wade the second shot.
<s> That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
<s> Where are you from, Captain?
<s> Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
<s> What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
<s> Same place we are.
<s> Those guns are close.
<s> Goddamn it, sir...
<s> I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
<s> Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
<s> I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
<s> I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
<s> Okay, Wade.  Translators?
<s> I've got a line on one.
<s> Since when have things been normal?
<s> Nope.
<s> Nope.
<s> Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
<s> How about you shut up and take your position?
<s> More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Bits and pieces.
<s> I think you're right, Keith.
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
<s> Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
<s> Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
<s> Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
<s> Ours is not to reason why.
<s> Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
<s> Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
<s> I don't like that one.
<s> But we accomplish the mission.
<s> Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
<s> That's a mystery to me.
<s> Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
<s> See to it.
<s> That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
<s> More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
<s> Struggling with a pair of Germans.
<s> I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
<s> Lingerie.
<s> He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
<s> What about you, Captain?
<s> Who knows?  It worked.
<s> Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
<s> Because he's guilty.
<s> We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
<s> Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
<s> Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
<s> Excellent.
<s> Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
<s> I hope you understand.
<s> Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
<s> I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
<s> The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
<s> Hang in there, man.
<s> I admit nothing.
<s> Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
<s> Come on, it's graduation.
<s> Meaning?
<s> What?  I'm sorry, talk.
<s> I can accept that.
<s> Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
<s> I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
<s> Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
<s> Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
<s> Okay.
<s> Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
<s> No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
<s> We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
<s> Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
<s> Okay, I give up.
<s> Dad, I'm sorry.
<s> I like him a lot.
<s> Yes, I...
<s> I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
<s> No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
<s> Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
<s> Alright.
<s> Look at those eyes.
<s> Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
<s> Yeah, I have to help my father.
<s> Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
<s> Hmmm....
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
<s> Bye.
<s> Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
<s> What?
<s> You think so?
<s> I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
<s> Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
<s> Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
<s> What did you say?
<s> Am I wrecking my car?
<s> Oh.  I was putting the...
<s> This is so noble.
<s> You're shaking.
<s> Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
<s> Your letter came yesterday.
<s> Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
<s> No I didn't.
<s> Just my dad.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
<s> Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
<s> I love you.
<s> So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
<s> Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
<s> She's really pretty great, isn't she?
<s> Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
<s> Yeah.  Honey?
<s> You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
<s> So what's up?
<s> What?
<s> I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
<s> How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
<s> He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
<s> Klaus Tauber.
<s> My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
<s> Oskar, please -
<s> They're not gone, they're here.
<s> True.
<s> Look -
<s> All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
<s> The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
<s> You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
<s> Yeah, okay.
<s> Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
<s> Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
<s> The war could end.
<s> Thank you.
<s> And killing.
<s> Yes.
<s> Stern.
<s> Would it do any good?
<s> He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
<s> Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
<s> The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
<s> thought he was doing AA.
<s> That's smart.
<s> Who is this?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> No, it's me.
<s> I live here.
<s> I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
<s> Did it?
<s> Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
<s> Home--where he lives.
<s> Youre all in this together?
<s> I think it's out of your control.
<s> No. This is a set up.
<s> So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
<s> I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
<s> And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
<s> Or it found us.
<s> Tuitions expensive.
<s> How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
<s> Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
<s> I think you're all an act.
<s> I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
<s> Not good.
<s> Can we turn the light on?
<s> No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
<s> Dewey, there's no such place.
<s> I'm everywhere.
<s> It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
<s> But who would operate your camera?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Where is your attacker?
<s> Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
<s> Don't do this.
<s> Please, I have the perfect excuse.
<s> I'd really just like to be alone.
<s> No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
<s> It's not a good idea, Hallie.
<s> You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
<s> Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
<s> ..harmonica style is okay.
<s> It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
<s> But...
<s> He's after me.
<s> I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
<s> I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
<s> Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Good bye Ben.
<s> Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
<s> Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
<s> Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
<s> He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
<s> Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
<s> To me Hollywood is about death.
<s> I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
<s> What did you know about your mother?
<s> He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
<s> And what made you think it was Sidney?
<s> Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
<s> Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
<s> Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
<s> Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
<s> You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
<s> Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
<s> Someone stole Sid's file?
<s> Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
<s> Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
<s> I happen to work for the police god dammit!
<s> Fuck!
<s> Nevermind, what'd you two find?
<s> Who is it?
<s> Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
<s> It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
<s> Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
<s> Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
<s> None.
<s> Need to get in that building?
<s> Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
<s> Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
<s> GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
<s> Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
<s> Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
<s> Who's this.
<s> Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
<s> Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
<s> Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
<s> The final act? Well let's play asshole!
<s> Are you sure?
<s> No one's saying you did.
<s> Piece of cake. She'll be there.
<s> So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
<s> It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
<s> Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
<s> That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
<s> No, it's not.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You sleep in THAT?
<s> So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
<s> Hey, hey, it's just me.
<s> The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
<s> When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
<s> You have to move on, Sid.
<s> It's okay. We need to talk.
<s> We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Do I?
<s> You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
<s> I only eat popcorn at the movies.
<s> I told you not to hang up on me.
<s> Or else what?
<s> Sure...
<s> I'll even give you a warm up question.
<s> Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
<s> YES!
<s> Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> What kind of lead?
<s> Can I bring Kenny?
<s> I'll get my camera.
<s> Yes, you doofus.
<s> We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
<s> Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Afraid not.
<s> What about the cellular phone bill?
<s> Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
<s> Keeping my eye on Sidney.
<s> She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
<s> You want to go live?
<s> As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
<s> Yes, that's right.
<s> Just stay back.
<s> Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
<s> What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
<s> Have you talked to Cotton?
<s> Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
<s> Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
<s> LEAVEMEALONE!
<s> Can you knock?
<s> No you didn't.
<s> Sleep tight, sweetie.
<s> She's the Scream Queen.
<s> Don't shoot. It's me.
<s> What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
<s> We had a run in the mass murder section.
<s> There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
<s> And what would be your motive?
<s> Like you had one.
<s> Why are you doing this?
<s> The official term is "psychotic".
<s> No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
<s> I'm not worried.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
<s> Ease back, Mills.
<s> Greed.  It was written in blood.
<s> I heard.
<s> I'll see you.
<s> Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
<s> I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
<s> NO!
<s> You'll see.
<s> Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
<s> Spit it out.
<s> And, why is that?
<s> Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
<s> All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
<s> Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
<s> No one yet.
<s> Is there any blood in it?
<s> You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
<s> Whoa, whoa... what?!
<s> Tonight.
<s> What about sports?
<s> And, if it's a threat.
<s> Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
<s> Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
<s> Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
<s> I know.
<s> Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
<s> Satisfy our curiosity?
<s> Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
<s> I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
<s> Oh, it's alright.
<s> This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
<s> It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
<s> No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
<s> Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
<s> No point in arguing anymore...
<s> Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
<s> One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
<s> When do we get to question him?
<s> You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
<s> I can't do this now... please.
<s> If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
<s> Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
<s> This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
<s> You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
<s> Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
<s> Why don't you finish the job?
<s> Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
<s> Huh...? No...no water.
<s> What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
<s> This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
<s> No sir...pleasure.
<s> I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
<s> I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
<s> How far's the river from here, Mose?
<s> How many, would you say?
<s> Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
<s> All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
<s> I'm Clayton.
<s> We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
<s> They have done...nothing...They are my people...
<s> Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
<s> That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
<s> Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
<s> No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
<s> I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
<s> I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
<s> Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
<s> He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
<s> She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
<s> You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
<s> Not far from it...
<s> There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
<s> No...not yet...
<s> You've seen her!...She's alive?
<s> Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
<s> Only if I'm dead!
<s> Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
<s> You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
<s> Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
<s> Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
<s> We just have to make a new beginning.
<s> So do I, believe me.
<s> You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
<s> Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
<s> Yeah... I have to go to town.
<s> Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
<s> Hi, darling.
<s> But what is the truth?
<s> Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
<s> And the title of this piece?
<s> Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
<s> And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
<s> Right you are, governor!
<s> My Massacre at Paris is complete.
<s> You have the money?
<s> Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
<s> Ask him.
<s> No Juliet?!
<s> See you in jail.
<s> Romeo
<s> Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
<s> yet cannot love nor write it.
<s> By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
<s> Of course not!
<s> I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
<s> Every word.
<s> Is it about a pirate's daughter?
<s> Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
<s> Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
<s> By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
<s> What do we do now?
<s> Go on.
<s> I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
<s> I thought your play was for Burbage.
<s> "Is the day so young?"
<s> "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
<s> Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
<s> I liked the dog, for laughs.
<s> All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
<s> I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
<s> Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
<s> "Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
<s> So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
<s> Oh. What is your name?
<s> Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
<s> I must. Look-- how pale the window.
<s> That's my line!
<s> You cannot, Wessex will kill you
<s> I was the more deceived.
<s> You cannot marry Wessex!
<s> Orsinogood name
<s> I do not love you, my lord.
<s> The Queen has consented?
<s> Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
<s> My hat?
<s> Do you understand me?
<s> It is only ours you can know.
<s> For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
<s> On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
<s> A theatre poet?
<s> I haven't lost yet.
<s> About what?
<s> Can I show you something?
<s> Think about it.
<s> I'm only asking you both to think about it.
<s> He couldn't get his car started.
<s> Dig the pit, I don't know.
<s> I don't hear this.
<s> Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
<s> So I gathered.
<s> Cover it?
<s> I don't know.
<s> And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
<s> Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
<s> Oh, yes, it's great.
<s> Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
<s> I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
<s> He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
<s> What I am.
<s> You're right.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
<s> I want my money back. Excuse me.
<s> You were magnificent.
<s> Don't you?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> No.
<s> It's the only way.
<s> You're frightened.
<s> Let him go. Let him take it all.
<s> You were going to say something.
<s> Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
<s> You're sure of that.
<s> That wasn't a question.
<s> You paid two hundred pounds for this?
<s> What?
<s> No one.
<s> Not any real sneering as such, no.
<s> Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
<s> Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
<s> Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
<s> Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
<s> And what do you recognize, names or faces?
<s> And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
<s> Who?
<s> Maybe... why do you ask?
<s> Yes, but... I thought...
<s> What do you expect me to do about it?
<s> Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
<s> I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
<s> Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
<s> I don't want to see you anymore.
<s> I gotta talk to you.
<s> But you don't know what happened.
<s> What kind of treatment?
<s> What about?
<s> Hello, George.
<s> No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
<s> Right now, I just don't care.
<s> Well she...
<s> Nobody can hear it.
<s> Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
<s> Hungry?
<s> No thanks.
<s> ... yeah.
<s> What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
<s> Why?
<s> I never get my hair done.
<s> Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
<s> Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
<s> Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
<s> Great. Who's been doing your hair?
<s> Yeah... I mean great.
<s> ... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
<s> Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
<s> You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
<s> What about it?
<s> Sweetheart, you're drunk.
<s> Fuckin' A --
<s> -- what?
<s> He never stopped.
<s> The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
<s> -- mmm --
<s> Look who's talking.
<s> Why?
<s> Please, we'll have to talk later --
<s> Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
<s> Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
<s> What?
<s> Don't go, Jackie...
<s> You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
<s> -- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
<s> -- oh -- sweetheart...
<s> -- how did you get here?
<s> I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
<s> What's gonna happen?
<s> Well, like what?
<s> Honey, what happened?
<s> Of course I like children.
<s> Yeah, baby.
<s> Going where?
<s> Just a second, I'll be right with you...
<s> When I get off work.
<s> Where's your car?
<s> Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
<s> I do, Jill.
<s> Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
<s> -- no, it'll help me, really --
<s> ... honest. At least you're honest with me.
<s> -- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
<s> What did you say?
<s> -- A wash and set.
<s> No?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Thank you.
<s> They're not?
<s> Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
<s> Yeah.  How long have you been here?
<s> Now wait a minute...
<s> What can I say!
<s> No thanks.
<s> Okay, thanks.
<s> I... uh... I... uh... can't.
<s> I'll call you back.
<s> And?
<s> That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
<s> -- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
<s> How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Really? How about starting with tonight?
<s> Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
<s> Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
<s> Why not?
<s> Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
<s> George is great but I know what you mean.
<s> I guess not.
<s> -- No. No really.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
<s> All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
<s> My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
<s> -- no.
<s> He's a hairdresser.
<s> Let's do that.
<s> You mean when are you going to Egypt?
<s> You're going.
<s> We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
<s> -- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
<s> -- just wonderful.
<s> No... how long did you say?
<s> Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
<s> Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
<s> What was the Donner party?
<s> You mean they ate each other up?
<s> I am, Dad.  Dad?
<s> No.
<s> Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
<s> Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
<s> Okay, Mom.
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> No.
<s> No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
<s> Do I have to?
<s> Well how can I repay you?
<s> A nigger cook.
<s> Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
<s> Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
<s> There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
<s> Thank you for saying so.
<s> Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
<s> Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
<s> Yeah... that's all it is.
<s> Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
<s> No, nothing at all.
<s> I can't really remember.
<s> Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
<s> Wendy!
<s> Go away.
<s> Wendy...
<s> Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
<s> I'm intrigued.
<s> Well, my predecessor in this job
<s> Thank you, Susie.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
<s> Just like a ghost ship, huh?
<s> I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
<s> I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
<s> Jane, I have to talk to you.
<s> Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
<s> What?
<s> Do I need one?
<s> I don't get you.
<s> What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
<s> You're not going to let it go, are you?
<s> Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
<s> Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
<s> See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
<s> Well... thank you.
<s> Really?
<s> BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
<s> With love.
<s> What?
<s> What did who say?
<s> Good evening, Vincent.
<s> That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
<s> D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
<s> Why?
<s> Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
<s> No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
<s> I know.  It's ancient.
<s> So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
<s> What a shame!
<s> Enough jabber.
<s> Mary Robert.
<s> Amateurs 2
<s> She said that?  Reverend Mother?
<s> It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
<s> You watch yourself!
<s> Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
<s> Give me a C.  A C!
<s> Bless you.
<s> What?
<s> Would you like that?
<s> Can do.
<s> I'm outta here.
<s> Silence?  No talking?  All day?
<s> No food?
<s> My what?
<s> And whom would you call?
<s> Your cell is more than adequate.
<s> Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
<s> Come, Sister.
<s> Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
<s> A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
<s> No.  No.
<s> But...
<s> Saving you.  Move!
<s> Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
<s> Don't push it.
<s> You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
<s> You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
<s> Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
<s> You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
<s> Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
<s> Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
<s> You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
<s> You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
<s> That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
<s> Who are you guys?
<s> It didn't work, Vince.
<s> She's praying.
<s> It's better than ice cream.
<s> It's brought people back to the church.
<s> We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
<s> Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
<s> And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
<s> Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
<s> You will stay at her side?
<s> You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
<s> Well... that might be... helpful.
<s> I shall, gladly.
<s> More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
<s> Is that all you say?  Look at her.
<s> And now Jonathan Masbath.
<s> My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
<s> "Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
<s> You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
<s> True enough.
<s> We should go.
<s> And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
<s> In test... what?
<s> Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
<s> Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
<s> Tired.
<s> Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
<s> Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
<s> May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
<s> I insist that you have it.
<s> You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
<s> To avenge his father, and the others.
<s> Katrina.  Why do you follow?
<s> He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
<s> I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
<s> And, what did he say?
<s> He moves too fast.
<s> It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
<s> Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
<s> Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
<s> Let her go!
<s> What did you say?
<s> You are from the Hollow?
<s> No.
<s> That boy wants me to.
<s> I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
<s> See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
<s> How are you, Bill?
<s> Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
<s> They was a boy. We made friends.
<s> I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
<s> You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
<s> Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
<s> He does make some funny noises.
<s> Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
<s> No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
<s> Don't tell me what to do.
<s> Don't tell me what to do.
<s> What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
<s> It went real good.
<s> Would y'all like that?
<s> No sir.
<s> I hate you!
<s> Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
<s> Why? Hi, Karl.
<s> Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
<s> Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
<s> I did live there in the state hospital.
<s> I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
<s> I don't want to worry your mama with company.
<s> How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
<s> Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
<s> Yeah, I did.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hit was right thoughty of her.
<s> If you want me to.
<s> I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
<s> I don't reckon I know.
<s> I reckon.
<s> Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
<s> No sir.
<s> I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
<s> If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
<s> I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
<s> Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
<s> Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
<s> I've got a feelin' today.
<s> Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
<s> Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
<s> Did Karl go to bed?
<s> Mama?
<s> Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
<s> I love you, too, Mama.
<s> Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
<s> I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
<s> Yes, I guess you are.
<s> Naw.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
<s> Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
<s> Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
<s> I could shore use some. Thank ye.
<s> No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
<s> Ma'am?
<s> You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
<s> I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
<s> Did you knock on the door yet?
<s> I reckon not.
<s> Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
<s> I wouldn't never hurt them.
<s> Oh. How about before that?
<s> That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
<s> That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
<s> I knew he slept in a toolshed.
<s> We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
<s> You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> Actually, I'm his father.
<s> American literature. What else?
<s> Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
<s> Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
<s> I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
<s> Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
<s> What's the difference?
<s> The Queen of England?
<s> I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
<s> It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
<s> I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
<s> You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
<s> Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
<s> Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
<s> Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
<s> It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
<s> Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
<s> Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
<s> You got it.
<s> I mean, it's a good story.
<s> Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
<s> I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
<s> Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
<s> I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
<s> Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
<s> I almost got married once.
<s> She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
<s> She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
<s> Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
<s> It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
<s> Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
<s> Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
<s> Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
<s> You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
<s> Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
<s> And these?
<s> I think I'll take them. 
<s> The refrigerator?
<s> How the hell did you get into the building?
<s> Thomas? Who's Thomas?
<s> That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
<s> He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
<s> Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
<s> And you told your nephew about it?
<s> You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
<s> It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
<s> And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
<s> Just passing through.
<s> What's your offer?
<s> An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
<s> Say hi to Paul.
<s> Huh?
<s> I owe you something.
<s> In Manhattan?
<s> You can't be more specific than that?
<s> Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
<s> I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
<s> Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
<s> Nice drawing. Did you do that?
<s> How long have you been here?
<s> And how long did I tell you you could stay?
<s> No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
<s> Take good care of yourself, okay?
<s> I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
<s> I don't know. For helping me out.
<s> I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
<s> I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
<s> That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
<s> The inspiration.
<s> No way.
<s> The end.
<s> Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
<s> Medium rare, please.
<s> Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
<s> Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
<s> In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
<s> I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
<s> Those aren't the facts that matter.
<s> Oh, in a heartbeat.
<s> These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
<s> You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
<s> Objection!
<s> Objection!  Speculation.
<s> I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
<s> That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<s> I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
<s> Yes.
<s> Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
<s> Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
<s> No, you don't.
<s> Still lashed to the mast.
<s> He hit his head.  On the way in.
<s> The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
<s> I'll take two.  One for later.
<s> It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
<s> Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
<s> He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
<s> The same.
<s> That's all he said.
<s> As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
<s> That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
<s> Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
<s> Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
<s> All right, girls - from the top again.
<s> It's entirely mutual.
<s> A what?
<s> Hey, she's ticklish!
<s> How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
<s> First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
<s> Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
<s> With you.
<s> So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
<s> Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
<s> As far away as possible.
<s> I'm Josephine.  Sax.
<s> Now you've done it!
<s> You tore it again!
<s> I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
<s> Fight it.
<s> You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
<s> You - you -
<s> Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
<s> Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
<s> Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
<s> Have I got things to tell you!
<s> Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
<s> You think he's too old for me?
<s> Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
<s> Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
<s> Daphne got a proposal tonight.
<s> Get me Room 414.
<s> Yeah - lets shove off.
<s> No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
<s> I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
<s> I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
<s> Interesting.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Isn't that ridiculous?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Half-full.
<s> I'm just going to get some ice.
<s> We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
<s> Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
<s> Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
<s> If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
<s> Oh yes, we do!
<s> I guess she's not in here.
<s> Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
<s> You like it?
<s> Yes.  For a whole year.
<s> What's the big idea?
<s> Help yourself.
<s> Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
<s> I'll throw up!
<s> Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
<s> We won't breathe a word.
<s> What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
<s> I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
<s> You got to be under twenty-five -
<s> William Morris!
<s> You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
<s> There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
<s> Oh.
<s> Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
<s> All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
<s> Every time!
<s> But you're a girl, thank goodness.
<s> I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
<s> I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
<s> Saxophone player?
<s> Just my feminine intuition.
<s> My fault.
<s> Why?
<s> Not very likely.
<s> Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
<s> They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
<s> Up, up, up.
<s> - Inauguration balls -
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> It's been delightful meeting you both.
<s> What?
<s> Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
<s> Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
<s> Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
<s> Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
<s> They shrink when they're marinated.
<s> I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
<s> Talk about sad.
<s> You poor, poor boy.
<s> I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
<s> Lets throw another log on the fire.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Mineral baths - now really!
<s> Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
<s> Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
<s> He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
<s> I told you - I'm not very bright.
<s> That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
<s> Who's going to raid a funeral?
<s> I never join nothin'.
<s> Big joke!
<s> That's an opera, you ignoramus.
<s> You and who else?
<s> Goodbye, Charlie.
<s> What for?
<s> Bacardi 151.
<s> Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
<s> So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
<s> Mom, please.
<s> She did?
<s> Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
<s> Hello, Katmandu.
<s> Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.
<s> Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
<s> Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
<s> It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
<s> I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
<s> I slept with your sister.
<s> Kat.
<s> Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
<s> Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
<s> I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
<s> Youre too good for him.
<s> What?!
<s> Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
<s> Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
<s> Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
<s> What?! No, no. You cant--
<s> I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
<s> Therapist.
<s> You knew?
<s> Its complicated, Dad.
<s> Just drunk enough.
<s> ...but its getting there. 
<s> What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
<s> Sometime, but not like this.
<s> That's where we come from first?
<s> You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
<s> :The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
<s> :HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
<s> :His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
<s> Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
<s> Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
<s> "You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
<s> I think so...
<s> I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
<s> Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
<s> What happened afta that?
<s> Mornin', Daddy...
<s> Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
<s> Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
<s> David, come back here!
<s> No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
<s> I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
<s> No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
<s> If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
<s> I brought these walnuts to trade.
<s> I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
<s> What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
<s> To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
<s> Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
<s> Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
<s> Will they give him a trial?
<s> There are more important matters right now...
<s> Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
<s> My head hurts.
<s> Montana.
<s> About what?
<s> But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
<s> We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
<s> Sheet!
<s> Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
<s> You bet your fucking ass it was!
<s> Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
<s> What?
<s> I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
<s> No way.
<s> Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
<s> I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
<s> Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
<s> You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
<s> Help yourself prickfuck!
<s> The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
<s> Eric?
<s> It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
<s> Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
<s> Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
<s> Aw, ma!!
<s> Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
<s> Uhh... Bacon.
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
<s> Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
<s> Kyle, check it out.
<s> We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
<s> She's not my girlfriend, dude!
<s> Yeah, they suck.
<s> Wow!
<s> No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
<s> Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
<s> Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
<s> He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
<s> Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
<s> We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
<s> Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
<s> YOU'D fuck your uncle!
<s> I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
<s> This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
<s> The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
<s> Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
<s> Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
<s> I am.
<s> Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
<s> Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
<s> Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
<s> Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
<s> You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
<s> What's the matter, Wendy?
<s> God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
<s> Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
<s> Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
<s> I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
<s> Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
<s> Anna...
<s> It can't be.
<s> Magnificent, magnificent.
<s> So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
<s> I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
<s> It's a little late for you to be up.
<s> I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
<s> That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
<s> Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
<s> Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
<s> Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
<s> Let's get something straight, Chappy!
<s> Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
<s> Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
<s> Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
<s> Will you shut up already?
<s> Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
<s> You're right.
<s> Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
<s> Ready as I'll ever be.
<s> Words to live by.
<s> The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
<s> That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
<s> A flare?  A flare won't do it.
<s> I can't!
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
<s> We have room!  Let's go!
<s> It would matter to us.
<s> That is one of my priorities.
<s> There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
<s> Homesick?  It's only been two days!
<s> What are you going to do about it?
<s> The engines!
<s> Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
<s> Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
<s> Can I get you something for the road?
<s> Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
<s> Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
<s> You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
<s> What do you want with old man Faz?
<s> You afraid we're gonna steal it?
<s> We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
<s> I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
<s> It was a clearance.
<s> Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
<s> Theo.
<s> The small ball.
<s> Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
<s> What's it look like to you?
<s> Don't say that about my mom!
<s> I'm getting to like it here.
<s> You got a better offer?
<s> I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
<s> I am underground.
<s> See ya 'round Maynard.
<s> Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
<s> Hello, mom?
<s> I found dad.
<s> Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
<s> I gotta go. Love ya mom.
<s> You shouldn't touch her.
<s> Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
<s> You made me hurt him!
<s> I like the sport the way it is.
<s> Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
<s> She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
<s> Who wants to know?  Zeus!
<s> They suspended me.
<s> I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
<s> Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
<s> I'm not here to - I can't...
<s> Won't your father help you with that?
<s> Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
<s> When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
<s> It's a vicious cycle.
<s> I'd rather you didn't.
<s> No. Do You?
<s> He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
<s> More than you could afford.
<s> I could let them go for ten.
<s> It?
<s> I told him you were my boyfriend.
<s> At least I'll die smiling.
<s> Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
<s> If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
<s> Open it, Captain!
<s> They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
<s> Fletcher, I want you back here.
<s> It's burning...
<s> I can't see...
<s> I can't...
<s> Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
<s> What if it attacks?
<s> High Voltage?
<s> Do you see it?
<s> Captain.
<s> Hold on --
<s> ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
<s> I don't know.  But it's something alien.
<s> What?
<s> Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
<s> I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
<s> No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
<s> I think I do.
<s> So you knew this when you wrote your report?
<s> You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
<s> -- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
<s> The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
<s> Jerry?
<s> Working on it now, sir.
<s> Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
<s> Harry?  Can you copy?
<s> Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
<s> They've left, keep watching!
<s> If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
<s> In a minute, sir.
<s> What?
<s> Ted seems to have some ideas.
<s> It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
<s> Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
<s> What's the message?
<s> It's not ignorant.
<s> She's not gonna know, sir.
<s> He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
<s> What -- you want me to retype it?
<s> She's not gonna know.
<s> To what?
<s> Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
<s> Wait -- down where?
<s> We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
<s> The timing has never seemed quite right.
<s> Get this thing off me.
<s> The library.
<s> What?
<s> Beth.
<s> It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
<s> You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
<s> Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
<s> I think so, Beth.  Yes.
<s> Fixing it.
<s> I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
<s> How can the sphere do that?
<s> Which I told Barnes was attacking --
<s> Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
<s> Why would Harry go back to using a code?
<s> How do you spell it?
<s> Causes sleep.
<s> Beth --
<s> Where are you?
<s> What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
<s> Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
<s> No, he can't.
<s> You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
<s> Is it?
<s> No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
<s> Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
<s> You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
<s> Get away from the door, Beth.
<s> Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
<s> I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
<s> Hear what?
<s> You'd have to ask them.
<s> It's an American spacecraft.
<s> Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
<s> Whatever I can do to help.
<s> Gimme another explanation.
<s> Am I?
<s> Did I?
<s> Harry?
<s> Her suit's gone.
<s> I thought she was with you.
<s> Stop what?  What are you -- ?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
<s> Wait!
<s> Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
<s> Think about it.
<s> Meaning?
<s> Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
<s> The ships?
<s> What was that, sir?
<s> Told me what?
<s> Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
<s> You mean you don't know?
<s> Who's everyone?
<s> What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
<s> Like what?
<s> Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
<s> Unless it's an act.
<s> When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
<s> There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
<s> We'll be back before you are, old man.
<s> Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
<s> You could put it that way.
<s> Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
<s> Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
<s> I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
<s> But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
<s> Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
<s> Why?
<s> Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
<s> I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
<s> There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
<s> I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
<s> If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
<s> Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
<s> See Threepio!  Do you copy?
<s> Are you there, sir?  We're going...
<s> Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
<s> I didn't see him !
<s> What about it, Diz ?
<s> Sir... I guess I do, sir.
<s> I got Games & Theory.
<s> Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
<s> Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
<s> Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
<s> You and me, huh ?
<s> Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
<s> Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
<s> Excuse me...!
<s> A funeral.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know, Zander.
<s> Your turn...
<s> I don't want everyone to see.
<s> It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
<s> Good luck at the academy.
<s> What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
<s> My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
<s> I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
<s> See you on the bounce !
<s> Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
<s> Thank you, ma'am.
<s> He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
<s> You got it.
<s> Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
<s> You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
<s> Nah, I don't do that anymore...
<s> They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
<s> Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
<s> We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
<s> Looks like rain.
<s> I won't quit !
<s> I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
<s> My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
<s> Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
<s> Here in Buenos Aires.
<s> Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
<s> I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
<s> Not a problem.
<s> Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
<s> Good for you. Go find out.
<s> Yes, sir !
<s> Cover us, Ace !
<s> I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
<s> That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
<s> To join with him.
<s> You may proceede.
<s> Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
<s> Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
<s> Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
<s> Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
<s> Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
<s> Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
<s> Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
<s> I'm aware of that, sir.
<s> Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
<s> Captain... I'd like to go along...
<s>    We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
<s> You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
<s> If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
<s> Twelve seconds...!
<s> Viewer, standard ahead.
<s> Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
<s> That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
<s> Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
<s> I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
<s> Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
<s> Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
<s> I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
<s> Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
<s> We're ready, sir.
<s> Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
<s> I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
<s> I'll be there.
<s> Sure plan to.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's true.  You grow up here?
<s> Yes...
<s> Yes...
<s> You're still here.
<s> I love your script.
<s> That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
<s> Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
<s> Cast stood me up.
<s> My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
<s> Paperclip?
<s> "Room Service!"
<s> You going to ask me in?
<s> Read the card.
<s> Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
<s> You believe that?
<s> Sure did.
<s> Go you Huskies!
<s> I can't get it to come out right.
<s> <u>Please</u>...
<s> Hi.
<s> What?
<s> It does?
<s> You know what else a man can do?
<s> Yes...
<s> I saw...
<s> Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
<s> Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
<s> No.  Don't tell me that.
<s> Why, you <u>whore</u>!
<s> We'll work it out...
<s> Hi.
<s> Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
<s> Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
<s> Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
<s> ...you got to get me that street for nothing...
<s> Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
<s> You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
<s> That Could Be.
<s> Uh, <u>look</u>....
<s> Sure, what have you got?
<s> Bourbon and Milk.
<s> Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
<s> Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
<s> Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
<s> Everybody needs a hob...
<s> How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
<s> I'm ready!
<s> Well.  What seems to be the...?
<s> There's other things to be learned.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Cool it, Babe, you started this...
<s> I...
<s> Yeah.
<s> We, we have to give it.
<s> What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
<s> I...
<s> ...she has a <u>home</u>...
<s> He treated me as if I were a child...
<s> I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
<s> Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
<s> That isn't very nice.
<s> I can't tell.
<s> She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
<s> Well.
<s> I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
<s> He told you that...
<s> ...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
<s> Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
<s> What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
<s> Yes.
<s> He should be put in jail.
<s> A witness to what...?
<s> You bet he did.
<s> "Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
<s> I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
<s> You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
<s> I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
<s> I can only write on a manual.
<s> Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
<s> I don't drink.
<s> Where have you been...?
<s> I'm out.
<s> I didn't say anything to them.
<s> What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
<s> ...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
<s> I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
<s> That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
<s> Find the money.
<s> "Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
<s> Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
<s> I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
<s> Sherry, this...
<s> Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
<s> Sherry, Sherry...
<s> And we're glad to have you here...
<s> ...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
<s> Ain't no second chances in life.
<s> I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
<s> I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
<s> ...why do you think?
<s> I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
<s> But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
<s> No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
<s> Like a big sister.
<s> And...?
<s> Oh, yeh.
<s> Maybe twenty.
<s> Mom?  What's wrong?
<s> Thank God for that!
<s> Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
<s> Honey, she won't d...
<s> Why don't you say hello?
<s> Suits me <u>fine</u>!
<s> IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
<s> No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
<s> No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
<s> Ice cold water.
<s> There you are!
<s> You owe me a quarter.
<s> Fine.
<s> Annabelle let's get something clear.
<s> Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
<s> I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
<s> People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
<s> Yes...if you like big hair...
<s> Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
<s> Yes.
<s> I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
<s> I'm still sick, but I'm better.
<s> Before you.
<s> Rache says it's from you.
<s> Every day.  More and more.
<s> Let's take our best shot.
<s> But you're not <u>done</u>!
<s> No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
<s> You're WHERE?
<s> Not to me.
<s> I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
<s> WE are over.
<s> It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
<s> Can I please have a cup of coffee?
<s> Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
<s> I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
<s> I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
<s> Wowie.  How wonderful!
<s> Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
<s> I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
<s> Don't flatter yourself.
<s> Luke.  Can't live like that.
<s> How the hell would you know?
<s> See, I know that.
<s> Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
<s> Beats me.  Ask your mom.
<s> It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
<s> Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
<s> I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
<s> Feeling the pressure?
<s> Aw.
<s> So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
<s> And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
<s> Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
<s> Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
<s> I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
<s> He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
<s> I think so...What do you think?
<s> ...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
<s> Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
<s> How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
<s> Does Jackie know this?
<s> Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
<s> Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
<s> Hey. What's up?
<s> What?
<s> He was in a concentration camp?
<s> Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
<s> Great to be here.
<s> Yes, Mikey?
<s> Yes.
<s> I did not go to high school.
<s> My grandchild-baby.
<s> Jesus was not bad.
<s> It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
<s> Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
<s> Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
<s> I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
<s> How was the class?
<s> You know he hated my story also.
<s> Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
<s> Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
<s> 'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
<s> Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
<s> I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Sure, Dad.
<s> Well, now you have.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
<s> And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
<s> Again!!
<s> None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
<s> All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
<s> C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
<s> Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
<s> Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
<s> Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
<s> Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
<s> Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
<s> Hunh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Maybe she has caller ID.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
<s> Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
<s> Oh.
<s> Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
<s> Why? Are we going dancing?
<s> If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
<s> What happened!
<s> You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
<s> Where does it lead?
<s> Are you going to kill us?
<s> Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
<s> You're going to pay for this...
<s> Shut up!
<s> We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> How much do they have?
<s> What!
<s> Richter-we got a problem!
<s> Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
<s> If I don't get power up we are!
<s> The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
<s> We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
<s> Don't be ridiculous.
<s> Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
<s> I know nothing of the sort!
<s> Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
<s> Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
<s> You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
<s> Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
<s> Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
<s> Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
<s> Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
<s> What is your name, young lady?
<s> What did you say?
<s> No, sir.
<s> But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
<s> That certainly would be a problem, sir.
<s> I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
<s> Do you recognize my voice?
<s> I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
<s> You're damned right they are.
<s> That's close enough, Major.
<s> I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
<s> You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
<s> You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
<s> Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
<s> That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
<s> Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
<s> If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
<s> I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
<s> Admiral Buldike?
<s> That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
<s> How many planes did we lose?
<s> Naturally I am, sir.
<s> Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
<s> Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
<s> Lothar, take your checks now.
<s> Maybe it's an exercise.
<s> The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
<s> Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
<s> What?
<s> Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
<s> Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
<s> They're moving apart.
<s> I think they mean business.
<s> Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
<s> Seond safety.
<s> All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
<s> In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
<s> You tell me.
<s> Take it easy, Major Kong.
<s> You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
<s> Sorry, King.
<s> I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
<s> But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
<s> What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
<s> But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
<s> But who would be chosen?
<s> Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
<s> I don't anymore.
<s> Knock yourself out.
<s> Intense.
<s> Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
<s> Why is everything about you, Jeff?
<s> Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
<s> Hey, you said you did a video?
<s> Right now?
<s> I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
<s> Where are you-hoo?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sorry.
<s> You wanna bet he's with a girl?
<s> Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
<s> I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
<s> Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
<s> Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
<s> Okay.
<s> Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
<s> Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
<s> No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
<s> Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
<s> No. It didn't, Buff.
<s> She's in the van.
<s> No, no, no.
<s> Oh, really? You wanna go look?
<s> Really?
<s> Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
<s> Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
<s> You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
<s> You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
<s> Oh, thanks. Thanks.
<s> See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
<s> Don't drop the guitar, man.
<s> Hey, thanks, man.
<s> "Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
<s> Yeah.
<s> A reel?
<s> No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
<s> Mm.
<s> Military marching bands.
<s> You cut off your little finger?
<s> It's nice to do a lot of things.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Taking care of business.
<s> Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
<s> I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
<s> Mm-mm.
<s> Two-fifty? They go up?
<s> Who were you talking to?
<s> No.
<s> Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
<s> I hit her.
<s> You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
<s> Oh, shit.
<s> You don't know?
<s> Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
<s> Just go home, alright?
<s> Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
<s> That's right.
<s> Nazeer Chaudry!
<s> I hate that.
<s> Man?
<s> It's a piece.
<s> I don't want to hear it anymore.
<s> Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
<s> So you can give me more shit?
<s> No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
<s> But do you stand for anything?
<s> Sooze.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
<s> Mm-mm.
<s> No, no.
<s> Yes, you do.
<s> No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
<s> God, you smell like whiskey.
<s> Oh, no, no, no.
<s> 'Bye, Jeff.
<s> What?
<s> No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
<s> Like songs?
<s> Yeah, really.
<s> Well, not exactly.
<s> Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
<s> No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
<s> What?
<s> Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
<s> Burnfield. No place like it.
<s> Well, what about this?
<s> Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
<s> Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
<s> Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
<s> You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
<s> This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
<s> Hey!
<s> Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> It's pretty exciting.
<s> Yeah.
<s> New York, huh?
<s> Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
<s> I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
<s> Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
<s> No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
<s> I can't believe you're still here.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Oh, my god!
<s> Really? What else does your mother say?
<s> Where do you get your ideas?
<s> Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
<s> Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
<s> Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
<s> ... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
<s> Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
<s> It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
<s> I'm here.
<s> At least I have a point of view, you know?
<s> Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
<s> Come on, Jeff.
<s> Oh that's nice for you.
<s> No car.
<s> You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
<s> I just pulled and it - it came off.
<s> It's twins!!
<s> Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
<s> Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
<s> Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
<s> Bye.
<s> Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
<s> Of course - of course!  Hands in...
<s> But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
<s> Jack...
<s> Sorry.  My hands are tied.
<s> I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
<s> Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
<s> Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
<s> I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
<s> Hold on...
<s> Kansas?
<s> Oh yeah, you caught us...
<s> Definitely old.
<s> Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
<s> Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
<s> Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
<s> Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
<s> I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
<s> I hear she was a terror to work with.
<s> You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
<s> In a deep freeze.
<s> The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
<s> I'll take it.
<s> Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
<s> About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
<s> Are you hungry?
<s> Phillip, you're mad!
<s> You'll be waiting for me?
<s> I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
<s> What teacher?
<s> This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
<s> Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
<s> Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
<s> Nice job.
<s> It must be my new shampoo.
<s> Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
<s> He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
<s> I don't want it now.
<s> If you love me, Joe.
<s> And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
<s> You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
<s> We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
<s> It is not.  Get out.
<s> Get out.
<s> Get out!
<s> Why?
<s> Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
<s> Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
<s> Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
<s> I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
<s> Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
<s> I'll take care of that.
<s> I've lost my car.
<s> Come here!
<s> Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
<s> Just follow me.
<s> I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
<s> Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
<s> I ran into some people I knew.
<s> Yes, Norma.
<s> I went for a walk.
<s> I haven't done anything, Norma.
<s> Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
<s> Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
<s> You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
<s> Go on in.
<s> Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
<s> It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
<s> I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
<s> She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
<s> What car?
<s> Frankly, no.
<s> Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
<s> Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
<s> It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
<s> Sorry, mistress.
<s> Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
<s> No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
<s> You don't like me? You hate me?
<s> What do you feel about me?
<s> What's that?
<s> No.
<s> Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
<s> What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
<s> Just like that?
<s> But why?
<s> It seemed that way to me.
<s> You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
<s> How do I fight it?
<s> I did.
<s> A passionfruit smoothee.
<s> And you think you're in love.
<s> But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
<s> Can I quote you?
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
<s> But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
<s> Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
<s> It's going to be a tree, I think.
<s> No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
<s> Somebody's gotta do something!!
<s> Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
<s> No, MR. Danvers.
<s> I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
<s> It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
<s> Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
<s> ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
<s> I know.
<s> What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
<s> TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
<s> Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
<s> Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
<s> For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
<s> And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
<s> Who?
<s> Oh...I came close once.
<s> You thought that?
<s> Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
<s> I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
<s> Me too. That's why I put this one up.
<s> Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
<s> Mmmmm . . .
<s> That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
<s> So where is all them half-centses?
<s> Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
<s> Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
<s> Black or regular?
<s> Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
<s> Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
<s> God, that's what I keep you for.
<s> They ain't got captains?
<s> Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
<s> I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
<s> For what?
<s> What will it do?
<s> What will it get me?
<s> It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
<s> Exactly. Stoned mother.
<s> Just a second.
<s> Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
<s> Anytime.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
<s> But the bridge...
<s> The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
<s> Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
<s> Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
<s> Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
<s> You've got to pick three more numbers.
<s> He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
<s> Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
<s> Where did it come from?
<s> Do I detect a note of jealousy?
<s> In July???
<s> Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
<s> What??
<s> Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
<s> Say you love me.
<s> Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
<s> Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
<s> Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
<s> Does she know about it? She's in it!
<s> No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
<s> You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
<s> So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
<s> Good. My heart can't take it.
<s> Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
<s> Yes, but it's not all I feel.
<s> Oh! That black box in our cell?
<s> Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
<s> Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
<s> Cuba.
<s> I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
<s> Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
<s> This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
<s> Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
<s> Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
<s> Clark. . . !
<s> You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
<s> It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
<s> Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
<s> Daddy . . . ?
<s> Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
<s> One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
<s> He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
<s> But why the hair?
<s> I must have miscalculated. How. . .
<s> There!
<s> You're just an experiment, freako!
<s> Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
<s> Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
<s> For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
<s> What do you fear?
<s> Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
<s> Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
<s> Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
<s> Nobody else.
<s> Thank you.
<s> We're running out of smoke.
<s> And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
<s> One of them should've been you.
<s> Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
<s> I will.
<s> Well!
<s> Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
<s> Actually, she's silver-haired.
<s> Not unless you can fly.
<s> Jealous? Of what?
<s> They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
<s> He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
<s> The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
<s> What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
<s> You think he's for real?
<s> Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
<s> Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
<s> I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
<s> Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
<s> What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
<s> Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
<s> You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
<s> But so is Vond-El
<s> an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
<s> All of us.
<s> He sure as heck does that.
<s> Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
<s> A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
<s> There are none of them any good anyway.
<s> It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
<s> Okay, but...why?  No offense.
<s> Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
<s> I came to talk to you.
<s> There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
<s> Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
<s> The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Very much.
<s> No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
<s> Yessir. Just what you wanted.
<s> Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
<s> Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
<s> Otis...
<s> Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
<s> Of time, Luthor.
<s> Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
<s> For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
<s> Ally.  That was my nickname.
<s> I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
<s> I'd heard that.  But she's well?
<s> Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
<s> Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
<s> She didn't.
<s> I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
<s> Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
<s> Alison.
<s> Not unless you can raise the dead.
<s> No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
<s> Why?
<s> Billy, please.  The children.
<s> So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
<s> A while.
<s> When the game's over, I guess.
<s> Sure.
<s> Well I don't.
<s> For rabbits?
<s> Berry-picking.
<s> Did his parents attend to that?
<s> Did they give him special care?
<s> What's that, Dolores?
<s> Yes.  He does.
<s> What other people?
<s> Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
<s> A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
<s> Well, winter's far behind us now.
<s> It's interesting.
<s> Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
<s> Yes.
<s> The people in the town?
<s> Oh.
<s> Okay.
<s> You seem very sure about that.
<s> Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
<s> So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
<s> Was the bus on time?
<s> Will you be spending more than a night?
<s> There's the Prescots...
<s> Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
<s> No.
<s> Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Yes.
<s> You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
<s> Well, let's see what we get.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> No.
<s> In what way?
<s> Any criminal record?
<s> And where did you sit that morning?
<s> Yes.
<s> Before the actual accident?
<s> Why were you scared?
<s> No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
<s> I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
<s> Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
<s> Very slick.
<s> How will he do that?
<s> Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
<s> I don't know.
<s> There's talk of that.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
<s> Is "he" inside?
<s> Alone or surrounded?
<s> Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
<s> Don't apologize for me, Frank!
<s> And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
<s> See my mother?
<s> Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
<s> And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
<s> Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
<s> Hurry back.
<s> I thought we were talking about Sidney?
<s> Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
<s> I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
<s> I have a message from your sister.
<s> Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
<s> You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
<s> Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
<s> But not for anything I did today...
<s> How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
<s> The man in jail is always for freedom.
<s> Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
<s> You're sure.  Find out for me.
<s> No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
<s> ...cigarette girls... And naturally -
<s> Can you be there by two-thirty?
<s> Hello.
<s> One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
<s> Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
<s> It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
<s> Help me with two minutes of silence!
<s> Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
<s> Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
<s> Take a top coat.
<s> Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
<s> Yes, but why?
<s> Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
<s> I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
<s> That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
<s> He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
<s> Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
<s> Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
<s> I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
<s> That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
<s> Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
<s> You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
<s> Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
<s> Liquid metal.
<s> We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
<s> Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
<s> No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
<s> Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
<s> Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
<s> Yes.  Throw it in.
<s> I'm sorry, John.
<s> I order you not to!
<s> Alright, it!  We need it!
<s> I love you, John.  I always have.
<s> Go!  I'll finish here.
<s> SHOOT!!!!
<s> Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
<s> And what it that?
<s> If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
<s> Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
<s> I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
<s> Son of a bitch, I knew it!
<s> Can you get us in there, past security?
<s> No.  There is another chip.
<s> Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
<s> Respect your elders and your betters!
<s> Eating is eating... and...
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
<s> And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
<s> Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
<s> They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
<s> Yes.
<s> The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
<s> Your manner.
<s> Not yet.
<s> That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
<s> Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
<s> I have a duty.
<s> Then you're going to kill me.
<s> There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
<s> No. Ours was damaged.
<s> Do you know where the Adagio begins?
<s> I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
<s> That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
<s> I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
<s> It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
<s> I was warned.
<s> Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
<s> Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
<s> 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
<s> No!
<s> How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
<s> Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
<s> I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
<s> One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
<s> You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
<s> Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
<s> Never heard of him, who is he?
<s> I don't know what you mean, Major.
<s> Nope.
<s> Jeez, and I never heard of him.
<s> Right. Claims assessor.
<s> They said I was dogged?
<s> Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
<s> Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
<s> You're late.
<s> I hate the beige one.
<s> What's it to ya?
<s> You like it?  It's my first.
<s> Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
<s> I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
<s> Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
<s> Then how are you supposed to get back?
<s> Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
<s> Who is in authority here?
<s> No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
<s> Like shit, boss.
<s> Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
<s> You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
<s> Did you?  Kudos.
<s> Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
<s> Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
<s> You should be.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> How do you know that's the way?
<s> Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
<s> Why... ?
<s> That tall, bright building.  Near there.
<s> Hm?  Oh, yes.
<s> Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
<s> I thought...
<s> Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
<s> Wha... ?
<s> How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
<s> Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
<s> What do we do?
<s> What... what do you mean?
<s> I'm back from the dead.
<s> We searched the house.
<s> Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
<s> Claire.
<s> What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
<s> Underwear?
<s> Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
<s> Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You shouldn't have.
<s> Fun?
<s> Like a stroke?
<s> Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
<s> You dodged a bullet.
<s> Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
<s> Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
<s> This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
<s> Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
<s> Robbed?
<s> Yes.
<s> You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
<s> Humor me with specifics.
<s> And if nothing's lacking?
<s> An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
<s> Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
<s> How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
<s> No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
<s> What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
<s> The key?
<s> No, you didn't...
<s> Thank you.  Goodnight.
<s> No, thank you.  Goodnight.
<s> Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
<s> Your brother.  Will you come with me?
<s> You know you can.
<s> You're joking.
<s> Sam...  Thank you.
<s> What about the house?
<s> Uh... Nell Vance...
<s> Well, I... uh...
<s> I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
<s> Why?
<s> There's a carriage house around back.
<s> Just stay there, Nell!
<s> He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
<s> You want company?
<s> Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
<s> Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
<s> She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
<s> I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
<s> Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
<s> In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
<s> I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
<s> It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
<s> Test it.
<s> How'd I know it was for you?
<s> Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
<s> There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
<s> No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
<s> Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
<s> I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
<s> Mrs. Dudley.
<s> I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
<s> It's all I could afford.
<s> That's why we're here.
<s> I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
<s> My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
<s> You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
<s> -- What do you think?
<s> Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
<s> What kind of food?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
<s> Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
<s> Come over here.
<s> Where do we go?
<s> Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
<s> Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
<s> We'll find him.
<s> Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
<s> Eduardo.  Rama.
<s> No reason.
<s> It was better than a telegram.
<s> I only asked.
<s> That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
<s> Did Jenny know?
<s> Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
<s> Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
<s> It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
<s> How'd the two of you hook up, then?
<s> Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
<s> They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
<s> See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
<s> You goin' back inside?
<s> You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
<s> He's gotta know why.
<s> Again?
<s> Probably.
<s> Really.
<s> Hard to miss.
<s> Sounds like Beverly Hills.
<s> Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
<s> If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
<s> Yesterday.  Afternoon.
<s> Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
<s> Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
<s> Nah, accommodation address.
<s> Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
<s> Based in London, but with international concerns.
<s> You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
<s> You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
<s> It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
<s> Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
<s> Did you.  What was that in aid of?
<s> It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
<s> Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
<s> You sound like my fucking probation officer.
<s> She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
<s> As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
<s> My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
<s> He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
<s> Nine years?  Is that legal?
<s> The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
<s> There's more than a measly few grand in this.
<s> Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
<s> While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
<s> Walked.
<s> I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
<s> Susan.
<s> You know I don't live with him.
<s> I don't.
<s> <u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
<s> Oh, Mr Crane--
<s> Geez, Mr Crane.
<s> He didn't say that.
<s> No. Uh... family friend.
<s> Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
<s> I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
<s> I'll have it in a week.
<s> Way out of line.
<s> Yeah.
<s> *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
<s> Specialty store down in Sacramento.
<s> $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
<s> The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
<s> Just coffee.
<s> Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
<s> Congratulations, Gina.
<s> How are you?
<s> You don't have to tell me anything.
<s> Honey...
<s> No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
<s> I took Doris's keys.
<s> So... who... who actually--
<s> So, who should I--
<s> I'm fine. Thanks.
<s> I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
<s> He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's very generous.
<s> Huh? No.
<s> My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
<s> Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
<s> We're just closing, friend.
<s> Uh... you're under arrest.
<s> I'm in.
<s> Anything missin'?
<s> Why not?
<s> If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
<s> We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
<s> I don't want to scare people.
<s> Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
<s> What's left of it.
<s> Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
<s> No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
<s> This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
<s> Pardon my French, but bull shit.
<s> Oh shit.
<s> Not so loud.
<s> I'd say we're in its home.
<s> Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
<s> Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
<s> That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
<s> Don't stop now.
<s> No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> Footsteps!
<s> Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
<s> What is it?
<s> Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
<s> Keep the light up.  I can't see.
<s> Holy mother, what is that?
<s> Get back!  Now!
<s> It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
<s> It's reptilian.
<s> Okay.
<s> You loved him.
<s> You were afraid of him, weren't you?
<s> What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
<s> I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
<s> I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
<s> Where did you see it?
<s> All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
<s> The planetarium!
<s> No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
<s> It's scared of me.
<s> Oh God!  Help!
<s> You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
<s> <i>Fiji.</i>
<s> Today.
<s> No, hold back...
<s> What's to see?
<s> Thank you.
<s> --a dead one at that.
<s> Certainly a nomination.
<s> And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
<s> And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
<s> I'm the creator.
<s> A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<s> Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
<s> Shhh!
<s> Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
<s> If we don't go now, it won't happen.
<s> I...I can't.
<s> Yeah, what happened?
<s> Sorry, I'm way behind.
<s> I told you I can't.
<s> This is where it started.
<s> So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
<s> Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
<s> You hate gambling.
<s> I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
<s> I bet you did.
<s> I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
<s> I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
<s> I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
<s> Were you there--how do you know?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
<s> Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
<s> Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
<s> Brought on by what?
<s> The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
<s> Kurtzweil, we think.
<s> You got some kind of business with him?
<s> Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
<s> No. Just fossils, far as I know.
<s> Show you right on a map.
<s> I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
<s> Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
<s> Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
<s> Did you find something?
<s> You're looking for a bomb.
<s> No you didn't.
<s> I'm in the vending room.
<s> Nice try, Mulder.
<s> They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
<s> They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
<s> No.
<s> There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
<s> I'd been told as much.
<s> I don't know.
<s> This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
<s> All the equipment is brand new.
<s> I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
<s> I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
<s> Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Just like that --
<s> I need you on this, Scully --
<s> That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
<s> General McAddie's.
<s> And they want to blame us?
<s> How deep does this go?
<s> About the conspiracy?
<s> No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
<s> What do you mean, walked?
<s> And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
<s> You need not kill a man to destroy him.
<s> Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
<s> Shush.
<s> I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
<s> And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
<s> No.
<s> I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
<s> He needs to be turned over.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> As far as I needed.
<s> Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
<s> The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
<s> You're the shrink, you tell me.
<s> Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
<s> What difference does it make...?
<s> I need you to find something in the basement...
<s> Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
<s> Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
<s> Dr. Kent.
<s> Completely unaware.
<s> Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
<s> It's his dog.
<s> Ja, ja, ja.
<s> They think you did it.
<s> No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
<s> I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
<s> He has a little dog.
<s> Dr. Winkel told me that.
<s> I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
<s> The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
<s> Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
<s> Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
<s> It's just what he used to say.
<s> I thought you wanted...
<s> We're both in it, Harry.
<s> Wait here.
<s> Me.
<s> Why?
<s> Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
<s> Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
<s> If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
<s> Of course.
<s> They're Harry's.
<s> It's true then?
<s> What did you say? I'm sorry...
<s> Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
<s> I was a friend of Harry Lime.
<s> Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
<s> Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
<s> When did you see him last?
<s> Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
<s> Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
<s> I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
<s> I'm not asking you to.
<s> We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
<s> She's right. It's none of my business.
<s> I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
<s> This way, miss.
<s> Oh, Mr. Martins...
<s> Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
<s> No, I don't know...
<s> Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
<s> I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
<s> What about?
<s> You've got plenty of contacts.
<s> As long as they can use you?
<s> I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
<s> Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
<s> A Roumanian.
<s> But you will.
<s> The Roumanian?
<s> How do you do.
<s> I have guests waiting.
<s> You saw it?
<s> Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
<s> Yes.
<s> You don't mean that doctor?
<s> Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
<s> What else?
<s> Not necessarily.
<s> With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
<s> I'm sorry, I don't think so.
<s> I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
<s> She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
<s> One or two kilometers.
<s> Why?
<s> So how many miles do you think it is?
<s> What happened?
<s> What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
<s> Not too bad.
<s> No.
<s> One night I will get the perfect photograph.
<s> Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
<s> If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.
<s> Where did you lose it?
<s> I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
<s> The Zionists aren't Nazis.
<s> Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
<s> What??
<s> You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
<s> Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
<s> At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
<s> I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
<s> Killing himself.
<s> Why won't you talk to me?
<s> Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
<s> They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
<s> Don't curse in front of it.
<s> Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
<s> And be crushed.
<s> You gotta get out of here.
<s> Did you see how they reacted to him?
<s> He's Jewish? Manzetti?
<s> I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
<s> Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
<s> It's the truth....
<s> What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
<s> No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
<s> What about Curtis Zampf?
<s> I agree.
<s> In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
<s> German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
<s> Sexuality??? What do you mean?
<s> What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
<s> Everybody likes to, don't they?
<s> Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
<s> Are all Jews the same?
<s> Do you know who you're fucking with here?
<s> Get the fuck away from me.
<s> The arguments, anyway.
<s> To hear them read Torah.
<s> How did you...?
<s> You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
<s> A forty-five.
<s> I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
<s> ...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
<s> From the Rhineland originally.
<s> I was going to ask you the same thing.
<s> You mean Ilio Manzetti?
<s> Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
<s> Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
<s> What kids?...
<s> Here...
<s> It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
<s> Why? Why would she?
<s> Where?
<s> Just do it.
<s> No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
<s> Wow, that's uh...great...
<s> Shut up...
<s> Why me?
<s> Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
<s> They're not that Jewish.
<s> None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
<s> Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
<s> I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
<s> Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
<s> Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
<s> Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
<s> ... So am I.
<s> We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
<s> Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
<s> I think I'll have a coffee.
<s> Yes, the Mamma is is there.
<s> Lira?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Then tell him to wax it too.
<s> "That"!  This is not a "that"...
<s> The rules are the rules.
<s> For others, yes... For you, who knows?
<s> Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
<s> Enzo...
<s> No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
<s> What room have you got?
<s> You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
<s> How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
<s> What?
<s> ... And his friend, Johana...
<s> If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
<s> As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't want to erase anything.
<s> ... Yes.
<s> We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
<s> ... I was right about what?
<s> I can't.
<s> ... Okay.  I'll try.
<s> Only to help the medics, I assure you.
<s> I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
<s> But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
<s> I got fired.
<s> You'll understand.
<s> Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
<s> ... Nothing.
<s> I saw how it has to be.
<s> No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
<s> Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
<s> No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
<s> It's my apartment.
<s> Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
<s> I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
<s> Of course, that's what they're for.
<s> But... how is he going to breathe?
<s> Why is he doing this?
<s> His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
<s> ... Yes?
<s> Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
<s> One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
<s> Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
<s> Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
<s> C'mon follow me.
<s> Oh. Okay.
<s> Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
<s> No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
<s> I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
<s> Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
<s> Mordechai!
<s> We go to the same temple.
<s> Happy Hanukkah Morty.
<s> She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
<s> I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
<s> Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
<s> Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
<s> But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
<s> Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
<s> Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
<s> The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
<s> Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
<s> No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
<s> I sleep it off.
<s> You really think so, Charlie?
<s> I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
<s> Up at the museum.
<s> What do you want to see him for?
<s> You found the leopard!
<s> Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
<s> Go on -
<s> Let me see it 
<s> She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
<s> You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
<s> I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
<s> Hey  I'm over here.
<s> Good evening.
<s> It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
<s> About Charlie's leopard?
<s> If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
<s> Not! I tell you. No!
<s> It's better you don't know.
<s> Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
<s> Thanks, Sheriff.
<s> Why?
<s> Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
<s> And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
<s> Don't be soft.
<s> The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
<s> He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
<s> I know. Funerals.
<s> Maybe I want to feel badly.
<s> You. Us.
<s> You're positive of that, aren't you?
<s> What! You can't be --
<s> I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
<s> Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
<s> I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
<s> Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
<s> What... What are you talking about?
<s> Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
<s> You drive a hard bargain.
<s> Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
<s> Paul Lamont...?
<s> How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
<s> Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
<s> Youre mad...
<s> Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
<s> I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
<s> It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
<s> No!
<s> My brother hung himself.
<s> Leon hung himself.
<s> If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
<s> You dont say.
<s> Good.
<s> You bastard...
<s> Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
<s> Something like that.
<s> Should I?
<s> I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
<s> We? You and your parents killed your husband?
<s> You wouldnt understand.
<s> A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
<s> Croissants.
<s> Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
<s> Im fine standing, thank you.
<s> No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
<s> How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
<s> A criminal?
<s> Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
<s> What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
<s> Were both thinking the same thing, right?
<s> Its up to you whether they walk or not.
<s> Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
<s> What sort have you got?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No... No...  I swear...
<s> F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
<s> Should I?
<s> Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
<s> Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
<s> Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.
<s> What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
<s> I hope its not too significant.
<s> Okay. Recommended...
<s> You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
<s> Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
<s> The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need. 
<s> My rates...
<s> Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
<s> Is my money in there?
<s> No. In Hampstead... Why?
<s> Shut up and drive!
<s> Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
<s> Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
<s> Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
<s> Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
<s> Should I come back in five minutes?
<s> Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
<s> No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
<s> How are you, Rhian?
<s> Should I be?
<s> Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
<s> Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
<s> My sister... She lives in the next valley.
<s> Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
<s> The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
<s> Hows the boy doing?
<s> I... How long have I been here?
<s> Los Angeles?
<s> Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
<s> Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
<s> Could that be Camden Market?
<s> Fucked-up fucking weird.
<s> O est pass ton salon?
<s> Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
<s> If he had, youd be dead.
<s> Its a good guess...
<s> Cost what?
<s> Of course I am, it's just that...
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> Very generous of you all.  How much?
<s> But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
<s> Now?
<s> Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
<s> How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
<s> Yes...
<s> Tell me...
<s> You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
<s> To marry you.
<s> Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
<s> Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
<s> No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
<s> Quite a few.
<s> So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
<s> You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
<s> We want her burned as a witch!
<s> How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
<s> ... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
<s> I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
<s> Am I... am I dead?
<s> No no, I'm fine, really...
<s> Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
<s> I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
<s> Not long ago...
<s> Last night.
<s> It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
<s> I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
<s> And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
<s> Buying her?
<s> I understand.  How much?
<s> You really think she's been sent... by God?
<s> You did well...
<s> ... You look wonderful...
<s> Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
<s> What difference does it make where she comes from?
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
<s> 20,000 gold crowns.
<s> For what?
<s> Yes, it's a miracle.
<s> As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
<s> That'll put fire in my soldiers!
<s> I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
<s> But the bridge has been pulled down!
<s> Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
<s> So... bring up the reinforcements!
<s> Of course I do?  Bring them up!
<s> It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
<s> Nothing... just taking his teeth.
<s> Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
<s> God knows, but it was a bad idea!
<s> I said, kneel!
<s> My king.
<s> And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
<s> WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
<s> Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
<s> What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
<s> I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
<s> What do you mean, they won't come?
<s> No, but... he sent me so many signs!
<s> Really?
<s> I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
<s> What for?
<s> Do you think this cross will protect you?
<s> ... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
<s> I need to confess again.
<s> Whose were they?
<s> I'm sure he'll forgive you.
<s> Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
<s> And what does he say to you?
<s> Why did she have to die?
<s> I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
<s> Oh, yes. I remember.
<s> You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
<s> I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
<s> That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
<s> Dorota.
<s> Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
<s> American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
<s> Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
<s> What's happened?
<s> What?
<s> Who's recruiting?
<s> Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
<s> Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
<s> That makes a change.
<s> We use what?
<s> Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
<s> You're out, aren't you?
<s> Toilets?
<s> Not this week.
<s> I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
<s> I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
<s> Cow!
<s> I was listening, Kitten.
<s> God forbid!
<s> Stop it, Wladek.
<s> Sorry, I don't remember.
<s> In the attic.
<s> We're getting out.
<s> Watch his hand
<s> ... without a shred of manners.
<s> No sound at all?
<s> There is something to be said for silence
<s> Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
<s> That is good, yes.
<s> The Alps.
<s> No, no bible readers.
<s> She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
<s> The piano.
<s> I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
<s> No.
<s> It was more to your wife that I gave it.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
<s> She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
<s> Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
<s> What will I play?
<s> Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
<s> Who told ya this guy was in here?
<s> Billie.  You ready?
<s> Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
<s> You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
<s> I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
<s> No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
<s> Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
<s> You think my play is bad?
<s> What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
<s> Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
<s> Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
<s> They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
<s> Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
<s> The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
<s> You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
<s> Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
<s> They workin' for anybody?
<s> What about the other one?
<s> What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
<s> I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
<s> You mean you blew it.
<s> I picked something up on the way.
<s> You know anything about him?
<s> I never played for winos.
<s> Neither are we.
<s> Let him wait.
<s> Just a little nervous, that's all.
<s> Then why you doin' it?
<s> If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
<s> See ya and raise three.
<s> If ya win it could make ya, too.
<s> All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
<s> Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
<s> No.  What's wrong with the front?
<s> Yeh, this time anyway.
<s> How ya doin', Jimmy.
<s> Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
<s> He cheats.
<s> I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
<s> I am after this race.
<s> Give 'em a little time.
<s> You're a lucky man, all right.
<s> Don't think I know him.
<s> Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
<s> If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
<s> With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
<s> Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
<s> There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
<s> Never heard of the place.
<s> Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
<s> Come on, gimme a break.
<s> Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
<s> Is that what it means?
<s> Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
<s> It's all right.
<s> Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
<s> Another young man.
<s> Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
<s> You've got to get your mind off this.
<s> Oh, Andy, Andy!
<s> Now do you believe me!
<s> was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
<s> No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
<s> Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
<s> Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
<s> Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
<s> Forgive me.  How are you?
<s> You see how much we have to say.
<s> A new invention?
<s> You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
<s> Only in bad weather.
<s> Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
<s> We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
<s> Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
<s> Nothing yet to cinch it.
<s> Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
<s> No.
<s> I'll take care of him.
<s> No.
<s> Well, what?
<s> When was that?
<s> Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
<s> Let him have his say out.
<s> I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
<s> Never mind.
<s> Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
<s> Yes?
<s> Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
<s> I trust you.
<s> What'll I do if something comes up?
<s> Is Julia going with you?
<s> I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
<s> I haven't been a detective for four years.
<s> My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
<s> What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
<s> How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
<s> He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
<s> Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
<s> Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
<s> Yes...
<s> You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
<s> I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
<s> Santa Claus.
<s> I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
<s> Breakfast.
<s> That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
<s> He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
<s> You did.
<s> Your guess is as good as mine.
<s> You talk as if I were Asta.
<s> I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
<s> He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
<s> I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
<s> Why, I believe the little woman cares.
<s> That's a fact.
<s> That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
<s> Sure.
<s> Smart gal.
<s> I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
<s> Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
<s> I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
<s> After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
<s> I don't know.
<s> His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
<s> Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
<s> I know I left them there.
<s> I'm fired.
<s> Y-yes.
<s> This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
<s> There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
<s> I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
<s> No, please, not again.
<s> Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
<s> Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
<s> I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
<s> All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
<s> You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
<s> I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
<s> I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
<s> We're at war.
<s> He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
<s> And let me guess who is.
<s> Suppose I don't go for that?
<s> We thought--
<s> Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
<s> It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
<s> There might be.
<s> OH MY GOD!
<s> You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
<s> We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
<s> Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
<s> Mine.  Land mine!
<s> Just be cool.
<s> Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
<s> It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
<s> It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
<s> Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
<s> The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
<s> I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
<s> I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
<s> What?
<s> We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
<s> Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
<s> Forget Wes.
<s> You still got a map on you?
<s> Makes two of us.
<s> Damn.
<s> Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
<s> I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
<s> I don't know.  They killed Wes.
<s> With what?  Against how many?
<s> You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
<s> Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
<s> A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
<s> He'll slow down.
<s> I could use some recon photos too.
<s> The photos.
<s> They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
<s> People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
<s> I'm saying don't do it accidently.
<s> Yeah, you're funny.
<s> Naw, nothing.
<s> What?
<s> It doesn't mean anything.
<s> Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
<s> Oh, no.
<s> I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
<s> How the hell should I know how much?
<s> Oh, God!
<s> Oh, Jesus!
<s> I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
<s> ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
<s> Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
<s> Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
<s> I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
<s> We have to do something.
<s> We make it, or we go back empty handed.
<s> Lines up with the map and the photos.
<s> All last night he could have been--
<s> He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
<s> Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
<s> What?
<s> Don't take anything.
<s> Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
<s> I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
<s> Don't let them separate us.
<s> They don't know.
<s> Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
<s> I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
<s> I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
<s> You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
<s> Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
<s> Why are you so concerned?
<s> Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
<s> You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
<s> What?
<s> No?
<s> I thought of something.....
<s> Yes...
<s> Where are they?
<s> No thanks, Bev.
<s> Hang on.
<s> You the Bomb Squad?
<s> Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
<s> That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
<s> This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
<s> Mike Reilly.
<s> So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
<s> Anything else I should know?
<s> Oh yeah? Prove it.
<s> Then let's go see what they missed.
<s> Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
<s> I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
<s> What?
<s> Your partner?
<s> No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
<s> Be right back.
<s> Would you?
<s> You got it.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Don't touch that.
<s> Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
<s> "Punks", huh?
<s> Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
<s> Hey, I'm next.
<s> Helluva fuck factor.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
<s> Shit. We're fucked.
<s> Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
<s> She wanted to cook me breakfast.
<s> It's about this.
<s> Captain assigned me to assist you.
<s> He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
<s> Diamonds all over.
<s> No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
<s> A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
<s> No.
<s> Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
<s> Smart. London, eh?
<s> If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
<s> Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
<s> Yes, Baron.
<s> Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
<s> Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
<s> Good day, Doctor.
<s> Now just a minute, Major--
<s> The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
<s> No--no.
<s> You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
<s> Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
<s> I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
<s> And take the twenty thousand francs ...
<s> Seven and nine!
<s> Darling!
<s> Certainly!
<s> Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
<s> Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
<s> Yes!  Now don't worry!
<s> Lily!
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
<s> Too much blue in crimson.
<s> No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
<s> Peaches and cream.
<s> Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
<s> No. What is it? Tell me.
<s> This used to be my secretary's room.
<s> Then I mislay my checkbook--
<s> And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
<s> Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
<s> Ye-es?
<s> Um-hum ...
<s> Good night.
<s> You would?
<s> I <u>must</u> go.
<s> I don't believe it!
<s> But it could have been glorious.
<s> He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
<s> Jacques!
<s> Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
<s> I don't want your money!
<s> An hour, two at most.
<s> What? You have to get to a boat right away!
<s> Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
<s> We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
<s> Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
<s> She knows.
<s> There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
<s> I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
<s> It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
<s> I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
<s> Not the better half.
<s> What do I tell your mother?
<s> No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
<s> What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
<s> I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
<s> Bollocks.
<s> Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
<s> No, but we're making excellent time.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> No.
<s> I know what ice fishing is!
<s> You're welcome. Rose.
<s> Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
<s> That penguin last night, is he one of them?
<s> Yes, exactly!
<s> Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
<s> She had beautiful hands.
<s> No, no! Just with her hands.
<s> Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
<s> Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
<s> Sure. If you like.
<s> Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
<s> Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
<s> You're still my best girl, Cora.
<s> Just move with me. Don't think.
<s> A mistake?
<s> Sssshh. Come here.
<s> Au contraire, mon cher.
<s> Could it have damaged the ship?
<s> We have to tell Mother and Cal.
<s> I know, I know.
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> I can't feel my body.
<s> That's enough.
<s> What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
<s> We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
<s> It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
<s> Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
<s> Goodbye, mother.
<s> This is Miss Marsh.
<s> You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
<s> Will you leave me alone?
<s> I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Montana?
<s> Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
<s> Where's Lother?
<s> Guess again, copper.
<s> Not at all.
<s> If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
<s> I'll bet a couple of hundred.
<s> Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
<s> You asked me to dine with you tonight.
<s> Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
<s> I'll be there--Good-by.
<s> Sorry.
<s> A lot of things I'd like to forget.
<s> Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
<s> You can live that down, can't you?
<s> Make it five.
<s> It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
<s> No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
<s> Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
<s> Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
<s> No, sir?
<s> Change?
<s> Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
<s> Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
<s> It's a pleasure.
<s> I'll go with you--
<s> Swell!
<s> Coming to the pool for a swim?
<s> It's a bet--come on, Sally!
<s> Why, I--
<s> I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
<s> She did?
<s> What's that?
<s> Sure.
<s> Next month is June.
<s> June? That's my wife's name.
<s> So what?
<s> I thought I put you to bed.
<s> Well, did you find me?
<s> She's in New York.
<s> Are you happy?
<s> You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
<s> No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
<s> News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
<s> Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
<s> Very serious?
<s> I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
<s> Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
<s> They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
<s> Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
<s> Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
<s> This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
<s> Do you think Lother could have seen it?
<s> Sure, Sis.
<s> You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
<s> Then why did you run away?
<s> Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
<s> Now Ed, are we cross?
<s> Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
<s> Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
<s> They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
<s> This brand.
<s> You retired, too?
<s> Yeah, you look it.
<s> In pace requiescat.
<s> I was kidding about that.
<s> Say when.
<s> I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
<s> Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
<s> You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
<s> Ignore her?
<s> I'll remember you said that.
<s> You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
<s> No...
<s> Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
<s> What?
<s> You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
<s> I don't.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
<s> I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
<s> Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
<s> Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
<s> Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
<s> Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
<s> All right, run 'em off.
<s> So he can tell the story.
<s> I'll be damned...
<s> Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
<s> I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
<s> Morg, use your head.
<s> Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
<s> Jack...
<s> 500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
<s> But she doted on the frowner
<s> Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
<s> Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
<s> Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
<s> - I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
<s> Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
<s> Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
<s> Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
<s> Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
<s> - We all want what we can't have?
<s> It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
<s> He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
<s> One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
<s> Not from forty feet.
<s> I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
<s> Hey - the world is my office.
<s> Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
<s> Hell. The CIA built that club.
<s> I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
<s> Thanks.  Take care -
<s> I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
<s> And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
<s> Let's not make it a habit.
<s> No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
<s> What?
<s> My father left me the business.
<s> Up.
<s> Trust me.
<s> It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
<s> ...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
<s> I didn't say when I want to die -
<s> Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
<s> Captain Morton.
<s> Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
<s> Pencil it in for the next trip -
<s> Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
<s> My timing always was lousy.
<s> Fueled and waiting.
<s> ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
<s> One to seven: Deal the face cards.
<s> I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
<s> You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
<s> Maybe I can get down there next week.
<s> I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
<s> Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
<s> Do you think you won?
<s> And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
<s> What for?
<s> I've heard some foolish things in my life.
<s> I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
<s> Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
<s> Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
<s> You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
<s> No, I'm too hot now.
<s> I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
<s> No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
<s> You better come sit down. You are still sick.
<s> It's healing now.
<s> He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
<s> Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
<s> That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
<s> I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
<s> It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
<s> It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
<s> Well, I don't want to put you out.
<s> All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
<s> Wasn't Hocker lynched?
<s> You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
<s> Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
<s> Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
<s> I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
<s> I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
<s> Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
<s> Okay...
<s> Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
<s> Bye, house.
<s> What?  What is it?
<s> I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
<s> Watch yourself!!
<s> You can't!
<s> What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
<s> That's why.  Sid.
<s> No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
<s> This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
<s> Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
<s> YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
<s> Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
<s> Don't tell me what to do!
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Look out!!
<s> Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
<s> What's with him?
<s> Everyone, it's Woody!
<s> Miss.  G-6.
<s> Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
<s> How 'bout three out of five?
<s> Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
<s> Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
<s> Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
<s> Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
<s> A lunchbox...?!
<s> That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
<s> No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
<s> Woody?  Who's up there with you?
<s> Oh, I don't like confrontations.
<s> Uh-oh.
<s> That's right.  Your toys.
<s> Sh-h-h-h-h!!
<s> Got it.
<s> See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
<s> He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
<s> Go away.
<s> Do what?  Oh, I see.
<s> You're not so old yourself!
<s> I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
<s> What difference does <i>that</i> make?
<s> All the time.
<s> So did I.
<s> Victoria -
<s> It's all right, Finn.
<s> Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
<s> He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
<s> I can't find Manolo.
<s> It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
<s> Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
<s> I want to believe you.  I really do.
<s> Arnie, thank God.
<s> Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
<s> Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
<s> Barbara --
<s> Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
<s> Caroline --
<s> I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
<s> Will we get invited to the White House?
<s> How long's the job?
<s> You can't make me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm third in my class.
<s> Just watch.
<s> We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
<s> I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
<s> Not Tiger Woods.
<s> Yeah!
<s> There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
<s> I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
<s> So you pay off our customs officials?
<s> I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
<s> But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
<s> I don't know.  Something.
<s> We keep our mouths shut.
<s> I feel like a traitor.
<s> Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
<s> She hasn't called you?
<s> I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
<s> Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
<s> Agents who died in the field.
<s> No. On you go.
<s> You've stabbed me, man.
<s> Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
<s> Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
<s> For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
<s> I'd fucking kill you.
<s> Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
<s> think I left something back at the -
<s> Shut up.
<s> I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
<s> Smells like it.
<s> Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
<s> The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
<s> Sorry about last night -
<s> No.
<s> No, I'm clean.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And you might get the fucking job.
<s> Another dab?
<s> I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
<s> One hundred and sixteen minutes.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
<s> No, he didn't make me touch it.
<s> And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
<s> You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
<s> About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
<s> So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
<s> We're two thousand short.
<s> Well, it's up to you.
<s> Stick it on my tab.
<s> The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure will, pal, sure will.
<s> Such as?
<s> She read it in Cosmopolitan.
<s> That's fair enough.
<s> So what's it going to be?
<s> Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
<s> Then I shall make use of this starship.
<s> My pain?
<s> Is there a problem, gentlemen?
<s> Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
<s> Plotting our new course.
<s> Pavel.
<s> Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
<s> Position, Bird of Prey?
<s> Raise shields.
<s> I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
<s> Have the Klingons responded?
<s> Understood. Kirk out.
<s> Put it on the screen.
<s> Go, Sulu.
<s> Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
<s> I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
<s> That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
<s> The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
<s> Mr. Sulu. Execute.
<s> Captain, what have I done -
<s> If you think it would help.
<s> If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
<s> Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> I believe we are witnessing my birth.
<s> James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
<s> I'm afraid of nothing.
<s> Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
<s> 
<s> 
<s> Do you?
<s> Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
<s> Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
<s> And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
<s> Okay, okay...
<s> You call that getting over it?
<s> That Dillinger's on to him.
<s> Hello, Alan.
<s> No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
<s> Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
<s> Not a chance.
<s> I'm sorry -
<s> You wouldn't dare.
<s> Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
<s> I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
<s> When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
<s> Where did you hear that name?
<s> No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
<s> Yeah, I... oops!
<s> Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
<s> Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
<s> Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
<s> Why? What are you going to do?
<s> Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
<s> The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
<s> Come here.
<s> You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
<s> Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
<s> End of line.
<s> Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
<s> We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
<s> We have to.
<s> I had to...in the games...
<s> Then I owe you some thanks...
<s> Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
<s> Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
<s> Simon?  Ohmygod.
<s> Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
<s> Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
<s> He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
<s> Why?
<s> In the helicopter.
<s> Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
<s> I thought you moved out.
<s> In her dreams.
<s> Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
<s> See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
<s> And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
<s> That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
<s> Put a tap on her phone.
<s> What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
<s> You didn't have sexual relations with him?
<s> Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
<s> Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
<s> If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
<s> But you didn't.  Why not?
<s> No!  Never!
<s> It's certainly... dramatic.
<s> Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
<s> Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
<s> Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
<s> What'd you do, honey?
<s> Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
<s> No.
<s> Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
<s> He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
<s> No.  Doris.
<s> What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
<s> Sure, hon.
<s> Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
<s> So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
<s> Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
<s> I understand.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.  Now go.
<s> It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
<s> What is it you need me to do?
<s> Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
<s> Knock wood.
<s> Ya looked through it?
<s> Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
<s> I thought Sonny was the good guy.
<s> What time is it?
<s> Would you like to get some pie?
<s> Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
<s> Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
<s> I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
<s> That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
<s> Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
<s> It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
<s> My pimp.
<s> What?
<s> You will?
<s> Thank you.
<s> How do you do, Mr. Worley?
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
<s> How come?
<s> You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
<s> He don't got no right to live.
<s> I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
<s> That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
<s> You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Get the fuck outta here!
<s> Now tell him goodbye.
<s> I certainly hope so.
<s> Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
<s> Elliot Blitzer.
<s> This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
<s> Yeah, let's just get outta here.
<s> No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
<s> I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
<s> Sure. I didn't hear anything.
<s> Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
<s> No problems on both counts.
<s> You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
<s> Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
<s> She seems very nice.
<s> Who is he?
<s> That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
<s> Sure.
<s> McTeague.
<s> Step inside.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Sure. No problem.
<s> Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
<s> So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
<s> How the fuck could he know?
<s> Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
<s> If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
<s> What can I do?
<s> Yeah, I live here.
<s> Are you Dick Ritchie?
<s> Do you know a Clarence Worley?
<s> You're still a little... disoriented.
<s> Shut up!
<s> What are you going to do with us?
<s> What's she doing?
<s> Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
<s> Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
<s> I need to go.
<s> They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
<s> What year is it?
<s> Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
<s> No more drugs.  Please...
<s> You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
<s> You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
<s> When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
<s> Jeffrey Mason?
<s> I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
<s> No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
<s> No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
<s> Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
<s> I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
<s> No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
<s> In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
<s> What's that mean?
<s> Not, "what", babe!  When!
<s> I'm here about some monkeys.
<s> Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
<s> The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
<s> It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
<s> You're insane, Jeffrey.
<s> You really want to know?
<s> Might be tight.
<s> You can't do that yourself?
<s> That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
<s> We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
<s> Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
<s> How much.
<s> The ticket is thirty dollars.
<s> Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
<s> Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
<s> Twenty-after-ten.
<s> I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
<s> That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
<s> You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
<s> There you go, sweet talking me again.
<s> Kirin?
<s> You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
<s> You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
<s> John . . .
<s> They look nice.
<s> The wind isn't blowing.
<s> What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
<s> May I carry your package, Grace?
<s> I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
<s> All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
<s> Like you.
<s> Nothing like a little liveliness.
<s> Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
<s> I can't.
<s> From?
<s> If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
<s> I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
<s> It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
<s> I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
<s> Give him the money.
<s> You could give me the gun.
<s> What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
<s> But I want to say with you,
<s> I'll get it.
<s> It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
<s> Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
<s> Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
<s> Just ran into a little trouble.
<s> A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
<s> How do you put a price on murder?
<s> The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
<s> How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
<s> I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
<s> I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
<s> Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
<s> And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
<s> Wh . . . what are you talking about?
<s> Christ, Jake, please--
<s> What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
<s> What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
<s> You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
<s> Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
<s> She's dead.
<s> I've had time to get over it.
<s> Will you shut up!
<s> Not before I settle with you.
<s> Stand up.
<s> I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
<s> Jesus!
<s> Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
<s> Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
<s> Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
<s> What for?
<s> Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
<s> Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
<s> Eh?
<s> Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
<s> Christ!
<s> I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
<s> What do you want for free?
<s> So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
<s> That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
<s> Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
<s> Stand up.
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
<s> Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
<s> Grace, tell him.
<s> I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
<s> Darrell's a moron.
<s> Live there?
<s> Like you don't know.
<s> I was hoping we could talk.
<s> I do.
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> That's a bit much.
<s> I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
<s> Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
<s> No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
<s> Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
<s> What sign?
<s> What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
<s> No.
<s> Eh?
<s> I just drove in this morning.
<s> Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
<s> I guess I've got wander in my blood.
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> Thank you.
<s> From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
<s> What?
<s> Like you.
<s> I have an idea.
<s> They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
<s> Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
<s> Is it pretty?
<s> At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
<s> Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
<s> It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
<s> Because I know you're full of shit.
<s> Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
<s> My mother died in this canyon.
<s> He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
<s> Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
<s> Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
<s> Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
<s> Which you don't have.
<s> No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
<s> They look nice.
<s> Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
<s> Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
<s> There's someone in the house.
<s> You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
<s> Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll keep it in my office room.
<s> I have a lock on the door.
<s> Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
<s> Yes.
<s> Jesus.
<s> I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
<s> Seventy-five percent.
<s> The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
<s> You're skill.
<s> Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
<s> I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
<s> What's he look like?
<s> Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
<s> I want to sleep here tonight.
<s> Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
<s> I'll help you.
<s> I mean if you knew karate?
<s> Jeremy listen to what--
<s> I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
<s> Against a window.
<s> Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
<s> On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
<s> We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
<s> We was... lyin'.
<s> Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
<s> Nope.
<s> You ain't dead.
<s> Three days. Are you hungry?
<s> I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
<s> I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
<s> Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
<s> You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
<s> You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
<s> Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
<s> I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
<s> You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
<s> Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
<s> What's your name?
<s> "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
<s> A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
<s> Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
<s> Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
<s> L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
<s> Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
<s> Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
<s> Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
<s> I could of... easy.
<s> Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
<s> Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
<s> What business?
<s> You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
<s> You still think he's in there?
<s> Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
<s> Tell me right off if you see him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I can't see 'em.
<s> First one what?
<s> Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
<s> You better get on back, Miss.
<s> Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
<s> You ain't shot.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
<s> You ain't like that no more.
<s> Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
<s> Why would the Kid shoot at us?
<s> He's dead, Bill.
<s> Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
<s> Did I what?
<s> What?
<s> Who said that?
<s> I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
<s> See that scrub oak yonder?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't like the question.
<s> He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
<s> We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Just like that?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
<s> There's more.
<s> He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
<s> Just forget about it.
<s> No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
<s> They'll never stop.
<s> Umm ...
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> Did you hear what he just said?
<s> County. I was in for fraud.
<s> McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
<s> What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
<s> Tough break.
<s> Not if we do it my way.
<s> Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
<s> I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
<s> You know damn well, dead-man.
<s> Who's your boss?
<s> Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
<s> A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
<s> Neither do we.
<s> Two hours, tops.
<s> Someplace else, then.
<s> Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
<s> You know damn well what I think.
<s> Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
<s> I told the D.A. everything I know.
<s> I know he was good.
<s> You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
<s> He loved her.
<s> Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
<s> Kobayashi.
<s> Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
<s> Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
<s> Give a guy a break, huh?
<s> Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
<s> Why didn't you say anything?
<s> I never heard of him.
<s> I don't
<s> He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
<s> He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
<s> May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
<s> Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
<s> Abrams...
<s> I'm fine.
<s> All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
<s> Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
<s> I was her doctor.
<s> Yes.
<s> When she...
<s> `Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
<s> Tell me one?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes!
<s> And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
<s> That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
<s> I'm just an M.D.
<s> I know of him.
<s> Meth...Methodology and Technique...
<s> I am seventy-four years old.
<s> Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
<s> Objection.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I . . ..
<s> You've just said you signed it.
<s> What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
<s> Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
<s> From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
<s> Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
<s> Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
<s> ... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
<s> Her doctors killed her.
<s> To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
<s> No.
<s> Thank you for seeing me.
<s> You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
<s> I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
<s> I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
<s> Yes.  Price...
<s> We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
<s> I think I will.
<s> Do you want me to go...?
<s> I've got to work.
<s> Isn't there something you...
<s> If I don't 'grow up...'
<s> I don't have a goddamned idea.
<s> I have to talk to you.
<s> Dr. Gruber's not in.
<s> Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
<s> Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
<s> ... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
<s> ...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
<s> So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
<s> Oh shit, what's today?
<s> What did she do?
<s> I don't want a mistrial.
<s> It's locked.
<s> My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
<s> ... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
<s> I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
<s> You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
<s> Yes.
<s> Thanks, Franky.
<s> Yes.
<s> As I've said we had some more...
<s> We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
<s> How'm I doing so far?
<s> Should I?
<s> It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
<s> No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
<s> Almost a year.
<s> San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
<s> I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
<s> I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
<s> But you knew about this.
<s> Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
<s> Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
<s> 0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
<s> I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
<s> Don't go.
<s> I'll take care of you.
<s> They're none of them right.
<s> Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
<s> It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
<s> Wherever you'd like...
<s> Oh, yeah. There.
<s> I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
<s> But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
<s> Yes!
<s> I loved you, Madeleine.
<s> Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
<s> Why?
<s> Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
<s> You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
<s> I... didn't know where you lived.
<s> John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
<s> Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
<s> You've nothing to apologize for.
<s> Not at all, I enjoyed --
<s> Well... anywhere in particular?
<s> If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
<s> Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
<s> Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
<s> No birds live here.
<s> The tall trees...
<s> And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
<s> I'm here, I've got you...
<s> All the time.
<s> There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
<s> Yes?! But --
<s> No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
<s> I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
<s> And it's a all real.
<s> You can't.
<s> Madeleine!!
<s> Does she sleep here? Ever?
<s> When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
<s> Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
<s> No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
<s> Ah, Johnny-O...
<s> Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
<s> Uh-huh!
<s> You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
<s> He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
<s> How?
<s> Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
<s> Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
<s> All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
<s> And she died...
<s> For what?
<s> Did you need it?
<s> Oh... this and that.
<s> Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
<s> What is it, a still life?
<s> How?
<s> But you said grey, sir.
<s> Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
<s> Can we have it by tonight?
<s> Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
<s> You're not a team player.
<s> You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
<s> They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
<s> And you're a little fucking reject.
<s> You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
<s> You don't know what you're doing.
<s> We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
<s> What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
<s> So I didn't fucking do it!
<s> No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
<s> Later.
<s> No...we want padded chairs...okay?
<s> Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
<s> It has to be done.
<s> I got you.
<s> So where's that leave us?
<s> Don't sweet lip me.
<s> You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
<s> Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
<s> I'm with Tina. Is she there?
<s> Where is she?
<s> Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
<s> Shut up.
<s> Nobody knows.
<s> Good God...Good God...
<s> However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
<s> He's having a problem here.
<s> No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
<s> What did you ask me?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
<s> I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> Moore?
<s> Israel doesn't have a King.
<s> What? What's your point?
<s> You will not screw this up.
<s> He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
<s> Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
<s> Goosed!
<s> I love you.
<s> All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
<s> What?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
<s> Sent it.
<s> Yup.
<s> I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
<s> You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
<s> Who else?
<s> What does Moore have to do with your growing?
<s> Problems?
<s> I will.
<s> Well I do.
<s> I'll see you tomorrow...
<s> Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
<s> Can we just talk this out?
<s> Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
<s> No Micheal did. It was an accident.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Move the bodies.
<s> You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> I just want her to be happy.
<s> At the newsstand on 3rd.
<s> Buzzing?
<s> The wahoo?
<s> Yup.
<s> How do you know she's dead.
<s> I got to agree with that.
<s> My God...
<s> I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
<s> I don't think that's a good idea.
<s> Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
<s> A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
<s> And this innocent child.
<s> No, but what a pity life is like that.
<s> Wasn't that cowardice?
<s> I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
<s> I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
<s> Fifteen yards.
<s> It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
<s> If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
<s> Why?
<s> That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
<s> I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
<s> I know that you used to work with an architect.
<s> Leave him alone.
<s> You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
<s> No.
<s> Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
<s> Very, very?
<s> This louse is looking for trouble.
<s> I had so many things to think about!
<s> I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
<s> Yes, yes, I saw you!
<s> From the terrace.
<s> I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
<s> I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
<s> You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
<s> Their weapons missing?
<s> Then I guess we're even.
<s> Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
<s> Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
<s> Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
<s> You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
<s> I was assured the problem was corrected.
<s> I'm still making adjustments...
<s> Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
<s> This is supposed to be years away.
<s> Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
<s> Then fix it.
<s> Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
<s> Think hard -- it'll come to you...
<s> I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
<s> What do you expect me to do, thank him?
<s> Of course you are.
<s> That's not true, Parker.
<s> You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
<s> Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
<s> I've been in prison, remember?
<s> In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
<s> How did you get your hand out?
<s> Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
<s> Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
<s> What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
<s> Enjoying yourself?
<s> They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
<s> Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.

<s> It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see...

<s> First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
<s> What'd you tell him?
<s> Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.

<s> My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
<s> Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
<s> I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> I'm sorry, this can't wait.
<s> Why do you need to wreck this company?
<s> Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
<s> Upper West Side.
<s> Get the hell out!
<s> Oh Christ!
<s> Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
<s> There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
<s> It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
<s> It's over you, Gordon.
<s> Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
<s> He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
<s> Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
<s> I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
<s> Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
<s> If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
<s> Suffer?  We're living in America.
<s> Ok toots, I will.

<s> Go away.
<s> Hi there Sarah
<s> But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
<s> I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
<s> How do you know it's a she?
<s> What does she look like?
<s> Fine.
<s> Do you?
<s> Have you been hurt?
<s> She isn't here.
<s> Um...yes.
<s> Very much.
<s> I don't know.
<s> She's making this up.
<s> And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
<s> She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
<s> Yep.
<s> Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
<s> The planchette?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Hartford?
<s> Please.
<s> Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
<s> No.
<s> What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
<s> Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
<s> Don't.
<s> It's Saturday.
<s> Yep.
<s> Three o'clock.
<s> Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
<s> Nice.  Almost done.
<s> Fine.
<s> I know.
<s> I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
<s> I'd never be able to live with mysel--
<s> There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
<s> In the house.  I was scared.
<s> I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Oh, no...
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> What?  No.  No.
<s> Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
<s> Huh.
<s> What?
<s> Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
<s> Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
<s> Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
<s> I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
<s> I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
<s> ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
<s> Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
<s> But then you've been so much better...
<s> Claire, please...
<s> Then where is she?
<s> Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
<s> You told me that I was...
<s> I...
<s> But I don't remember.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Since when?
<s> Oh God...
<s> You don't have to do that.
<s> Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
<s> Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
<s> IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
<s> Shhhh.
<s> With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.

<s> Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
<s> You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
<s> ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
<s> Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
<s> 'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
<s> Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
<s> The one time I want it to work...
<s> You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
<s> Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
<s> You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
<s> 
<s> Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
<s> Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
<s> - a witch.
<s> Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
<s> He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
<s> Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
<s> It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
<s> Hello..
<s> If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
<s> I don't think of us that way - ever.
<s> Dropped it.
<s> Mm-hmm...
<s> I love you too.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What were you talking about...?
<s> Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
<s> Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
<s> Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
<s> Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
<s> Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
<s> CHIC MAGAZINE?
<s> BRIAN...
<s> I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
<s> No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
<s> Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
<s> I really don't know what to say
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
<s> Yes, one and a half please.
<s> And how many people have you killed?
<s> Where do you kill them...
<s> my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
<s> I don't want to talk about it -
<s> Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
<s> I have something I have to show you...
<s> I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
<s> That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
<s> Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
<s> I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
<s> Out - I may be some time
<s> Yes - I suppose so...
<s> There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
<s> No - I'll have you after
<s> Don't worry about it -
<s> Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
<s> Well, Dad said...
<s> Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
<s> Yeah, whatever.
<s> I better go, Dad.
<s> Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
<s> It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
<s> With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
<s> Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
<s> These are real, live women?
<s> Jealousy is so unattractive.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah? You like?
<s> Do it?
<s> Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
<s> We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
<s> We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
<s> It's my private business! Mine!
<s> Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
<s> I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
<s> ...not the pit.
<s> Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
<s> They're in the ignition, silly.
<s> I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
<s> What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
<s> Of course we were.
<s> We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
<s> Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
<s> I understand.
<s> Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
<s> Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
<s> Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
<s> From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
<s> Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
<s> That's not ENTIRELY true.
<s> "Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
<s> I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
<s> Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
<s> You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
<s> Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
<s> Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
<s> I know.
<s> There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
<s> My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
<s> Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
<s> Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
<s> No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
<s> What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
<s> What is all this? When are you coming home?
<s> I'll make you very proud.
<s> Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
<s> We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
<s> Rules are rules.
<s> A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
<s> As much as possible.
<s> Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
<s> I can't wait to see the pictures.
<s> I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
<s> My job. Back off, Benedict.
<s> I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
<s> I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
<s> Kelly Van Ryan...
<s> Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
<s> What about the blood?
<s> Was there ever any kind of investigation...
<s> Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
<s> I understand.
<s> I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
<s> I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
<s> I'd like that.
<s> No.
<s> Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
<s> You're telling me you believe the guy?
<s> Lombardo's settlement?
<s> Just check out the car.
<s> Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
<s> You don't think Sam could've put it there?
<s> We don't know that, Ray...
<s> Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
<s> I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
<s> I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
<s> Oh, for Christ's sake.
<s> I miss Dad.
<s> Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
<s> About six and a half million dollars.
<s> Do it to ourselves?
<s> Why can't you come...
<s> There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
<s> Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
<s> Will they?
<s> You got something against cigarettes?
<s> That's cop bullshit.
<s> About what?
<s> Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
<s> Story's the same, Detective...
<s> Are you mad at me?
<s> But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
<s> Hi, Sandy.
<s> What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
<s> To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
<s> If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
<s> Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
<s> Is this leading somewhere?
<s> Starting with a screw?
<s> Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
<s> Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
<s> All what?
<s> It's a repeating steam cannon!
<s> At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
<s> You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
<s> Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
<s> That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
<s> I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
<s> I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
<s> Of course not.
<s> Where have you been?
<s> In the next two minutes?
<s> My Lord, he was telling the truth!
<s> But it only has six legs.
<s> I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
<s> You tell me.
<s> I've had some practice.
<s> Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
<s> That would be... the Mexican War?
<s> Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
<s> Who was this partner of his?
<s> For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
<s> He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
<s> It's a smelting retort.
<s> Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
<s> Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
<s> You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
<s> Not today, Willow.
<s> If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
<s> Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
<s> Madmartigan.
<s> As above, so below.
<s> Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
<s> I don't know.
<s> Friend of yours?
<s> You don't know anything about ba- bies.
<s> Where the hell did you come from?
<s> These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
<s> That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
<s> Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
<s> I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
<s> No.
<s> Burn it to a fine ash.
<s> I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
<s> That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
<s> No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
<s> You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
<s> No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
<s> Surrender!!
<s> Queen Cherlindrea?
<s> Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
<s> Not one this big.
<s> Guess I'm not used to so much.
<s> Sorry. It's important.
<s> That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
<s> Okay, Mr. Book.
<s> You don't say.
<s> I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
<s> Maybe.
<s> Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
<s> Just us.
<s> Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
<s> We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
<s> The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
<s> No.
<s> You tell him. When you're able.
<s> Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
<s> Oh. The bullets.
<s> I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
<s> Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
<s> Where's my baggy pants?
<s> What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
<s> Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
<s> What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
<s> Not yet.
<s> I don't know where he is.
<s> Yes.
<s> You didn't have to...
<s> His name is John Book.
<s> I know.
<s> He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
<s> John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
<s> They don't have any shit.
<s> All right, where is he?
<s> I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
<s> Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
<s> Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
<s> You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
<s> No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
<s> Oh, I hope we got them in time.
<s> Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
<s> Is morally, ethic'ly
<s> The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
<s> I don't believe you!
<s> Hickory!
<s> All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
<s> Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
<s> Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
<s> Catch him, you fool!
<s> Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
<s> Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
<s> Toto, too.
<s> How did you guess?
<s> Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
<s> Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
<s> No, they won't - honestly.
<s> Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
<s> Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
<s> Has it poppies on the wall....
<s> Oh, no -- no!
<s> But you couldn't have been, could you?
<s> Stop her!
<s> My mouth -- my mouth!
<s> Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
<s> Oh! Oh!
<s> You've had plenty of time already!
<s> And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
<s> Not nobody, not nohow!
<s> Oh, come on.
<s> Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
<s> What?
<s> Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
<s> Yes --- there.
<s> And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
<s> Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
<s> Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
<s> Did you just hear what I just heard?
<s> It's too late!  There they....
<s> It did?
<s> Who at?
<s> Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
<s> Fine.  He's got a plan
<s> Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
<s> Yeah!
<s> Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
<s> Why don't you try counting sheep?
<s> Hold still - hold still --
<s> It's a whatzis?
<s> Don't push!
<s> Not nohow!
<s> Howdy, Miss Gulch.
<s> Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
<s> We do.
<s> A heart --
<s> I don't think I could, but we could try.
<s> Here, Tin Man -- help me.
<s> Ho -- ho --ho
<s> I can fairly hear my heart beating!
<s> It's a whozis?
<s> But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
<s> Go on!
<s> Th.D.?
<s> I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
<s> She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
<s> Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
<s> Just wanted to put him on edge...
<s> Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
<s> Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
<s> I was the one who brought that money in...
<s> The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
<s> Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
<s> The worm on the hook again.
<s> Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
<s> Who did you get it from?
<s> You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
<s> Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
<s> My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
<s> You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
<s> I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
<s> I have to go to work.
<s> Shush.
<s> I think you do.
<s> Not interested.
<s> Five more turns and your neck will break.
<s> No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
<s> Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
<s> How high up does this...arms dealing go?
<s> The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
<s> How appropriate.
<s> Please.
<s> Someone will come.
<s> How would you know?
<s> Of course...
<s> Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
<s> Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
<s> Don't call me that.
<s> Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
<s> Collect me?
<s> Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
<s> I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
<s> I won't do that.
<s> Jon -- what??
<s> Veidts complex.
<s> Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
<s> What is it?  How does it work?
<s> Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
<s> Damn straight!  We were heroes.
<s> He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
<s> Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
<s> I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
<s> His . . . whatever.
<s> Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
<s> Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
<s> I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
<s> What are you up to?
<s> I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
<s> I think he's going to the john.
<s> Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
<s> What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
<s> Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
<s> He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
<s> With lots of ketchup?
<s> I don't know their real names.
<s> What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
<s> What does this mean?  What does it --
<s> I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
<s> Laurie!  Good to see you.
<s> ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
<s> You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
<s> I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
<s> I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
<s> You're a jerk-off, you know that?
<s> They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
<s> I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
<s> So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
<s> Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
<s> I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> Mind your business.
<s> You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
<s> Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
<s> So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
<s> There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
<s> I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
<s> I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
<s> When can I see you again?
<s> I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
<s> We'll have to go after them.
<s> Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
<s> Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
<s> You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
<s> They come in any other styles or colors?
<s> I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
<s> Yeah, thanks a lot.
<s> You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
<s> What's the deal?
<s> Been to any good diners lately?
<s> You wanna see my politics?
<s> I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
<s> So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
<s> You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
<s> It's too far.
<s> I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
<s> You know, you --
<s> Sure you are, sport.
<s> Some cigars.  Case of beer.
<s> Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
<s> You're backstage at the encore of creation.
<s> In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
<s> ALIVE.
<s> What do you want with him?
<s> What do you mean to do?
<s> Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
<s> You have the wrong house.
<s> Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
<s> Victor Frankenstein.
<s> Poppycock!
<s> From your office, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
<s> Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
<s> Is it that music?
<s> Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
<s> I...
<s> Yes.
<s> I promise.
<s> Oh, darling -- so will I.
<s> You're incorrigible!
<s> No, of course not.  I just meant...
<s> But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
<s> You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
<s> Is it worth taking a chance?
<s> Does that include the key to the laboratory?
<s> Why did you do that?
<s> Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
<s> Dr. Fronkonsteen!
<s> My father was a sick man.
<s> Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
<s> What wockers?
<s> What?
<s> Must be the music room.
<s> And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
<s> Tonight?
<s> You've got it, master.
<s> I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
<s> Don't fall for that one.
<s> Give -- me -- your -- hand!
<s> I'm not trying to be funny.
<s> ... I'm glad that's...
<s> What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
<s> What???
<s> That sound good, boss.
<s> It's alive!
