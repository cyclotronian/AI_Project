You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
There.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Why didn't you tell me?
That I'm used to.
That girl -- I --
You makin' any headway?
Yeah
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
You didn't
What plan?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
May I ask by whom?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
We're lost!
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Oh.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Okay.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
Traitor!!
I'll take him.
What?
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
How?
Really?
Yeah?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
What?
Yeah, I see her.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
...What's your name?
...Hello?
...Ma???
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Which one?
Apipoussan?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
I never killed anyone.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Why do you think he did it?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Hello... ?
I remember.  You just left...
You alright?
What the hell was that?
Been up with Alice.
Mark, are you okay?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Vomit?
You, too?
Reef!
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
Cyclops?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
They said.
No brag. Just fact.
On your sleeve.
I just think you used to be bad.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Lillian!
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
No shit.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you have to be so brutal?
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
You wanna knock of f?
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Elaine, what happened to us?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
William Harcourt?
Please, I must get out here.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
So what do I tell this guy?
Where?
Hardly.
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
It is miraculous.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Pupils?
I do.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you hear me?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Why are you so anxious?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
No. I won't.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
I couldn't lose him.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
I swear --
Where you boys going?
The safe. Now.
Then why can't I go in there?
This has been a good year.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
And you're too young.
You wouldn't have done that?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Yes, darling?
Listen, what about dinner?
Dorsia, yes?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Patrick? Is that you?
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
So was I.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
What?
I lost my job...
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
It's important.
You look beautiful.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
You know mine.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Don't mind if I do.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
An evil petting zoo?
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
Flower ...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Amnesia?
Insane ... ?
Aren't you forgetting about something?
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
All right!
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
So, Larry, how have you been?
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
I'd love that.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Roll the hose.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Did you pull me out?
They're waitin' man.
Shadow.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
De-la-croix.
Mantan?
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Hello.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
Who's side are you on?
Don't make me have to use this.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
Why don't you call him?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
We're not finished yet --
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
He said he worked there --
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
He admitted it.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
You're kidding.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
We just want --
You think he did it?
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
Karl.
What did she say?
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
Why not religion, Dad?
Let's get out of here.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
What's this?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Put the fucking kettle down.
I do. I want to very badly.
I don't want to talk about it.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
Why?
I bet you have loyal customers.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Don't... don't say that to me...
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Let's go.
This the right place?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
And I'm supposed to care?
How big a package we talking about?
I want a gun.
Could you fill me in?
You had my help, detective.
What, Sebastian?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
What about a summary then.
Those cockroaches?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Is there anything else?
You use your equipment, don't you?
I can imagine.
How are you doing?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
How's that?
This is for me.
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
That's ridiculous.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
A card?
Uh-huh.
It's time.
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
I see "elegant."
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Why do you do it?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Frank?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
No, you're right.
Good to see you, son.
How is Central these days?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I've gotta go in.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
What was that all about?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
Now, you will receive us.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Help me move him.
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Absolutely.
Did you ever steal a car before?
Give him a second.
That's my responsibility.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Join the party, fellas.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Show me again...
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
Say it.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Wallace has sacked York!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Books?
I know, but...
What's happened to you?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Does he know that?
And you want to know --
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Ilsa, I --
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Save some for tomorrow.
Yeah, a long one.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
He is a cute thing.
Thought you were going to bring her.
When'd you start working here?
You what?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Oh Jesus!
What about... The money?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
What?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Ouch.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Really?
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
I've lived there.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Yeah.
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Thanks.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Who is...
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
You believe that?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
She's got my word.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Uh... dudes?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
When can I squeeze one out?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
What is going to happen?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
I found it.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Oh, no.
Yes John?
The workhouse.
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
Erik. You don't understand.
No. 
Why should you care?
Halfdan the Black's here!
What did he say?
What?
I can't swim! I can't swim!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
What do you want to hear?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Have sex. Y'know --
Yeah?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
It was snowing.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
The containment, Second Containment...
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
What's wrong with me?
This is wrong in so many ways.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
I can't find it, mon!
I take out the garbage.
What's wrong?
My brother is gonna shit.
What do you think?
I paid for it and everything.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
He wanted the pineal gland.
I have to go.
You degenerate pig!
Lucy.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
You realize...
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
We gotta be close.
Um-hmmm.
What do you mean what?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Age?
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
What for?
Oh my God, I look awful.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Oh! Are you really?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Our decision. Together.
Henry Clerval.
Electricity.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Somebody's there, Barry.
Roll him over!
Jack?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Why did they block the door again?
What's your name?
Yes.
About two hours from now.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Not even for lunch?
Start the car.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Uh, question, ma'am.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
So dump on me.
That bad?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
Got it.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
I like that image.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
About this much.
Systems register functional.
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
You're kidding. When for?
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
Well, what have you thought?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
Who is that!?
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
That's all there is to it, huh?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You're an investor, is that it?
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
Really? You ever been arrested?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
He already knew it.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Could be a fishing boat.
She was sailing up north, right?
Morning.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Yeah, right...
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
There he is...
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
We're not.
Didn't they tell you?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
What did you tell that girl?
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
What is that?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Oh, hi...
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Soon. 
Hello, Peter.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
You were supposed to help me with this.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
Tell him about the toaster.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Where have you been?
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
You need to come home!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Do you want some dinner?
Why not?
But you're not enrolled.
Why?
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Could I make one phone call first?
Will you take me home?
Will you come in, please?
Do you want me to get it?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Well how long has this been going on.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I'm just --
And what are you going to do?
I don't like your tone.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
What can you see?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
Is that too much, Baron?
Oh -- but -- I --
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
You dance splendidly.
What brown hands you have.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
How clear is Manchester?
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
You're calling the shots.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
What are you looking at?
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Where are you going?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
What'll you do for transportation?
Months?
Dad--
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
Disease?
Go on.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
I mean it!
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Good Lord.
Here.  Finish the job.
Alice is dead?
How horrible.
Not true.
Yes, he is.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
I'm getting angry.
Are you the star of this picture?
You making a feature?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Sounds all right.
Eh, no. Thank you.
What happened?
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
Did Confucius say that?
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
It's almost over!!
C'mon -- Rasputin??
I don't want him.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
You remember.
Kirsty.
Oh!
What's wrong?
Alison's.
Yeah.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
I dunno.
Shit!
You won't like it.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
He was unsual.
Good reflexes.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
You want me to front for you.
Get out.
A murder.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
I'm your future husband, remember?
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
How do you mean?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
So have we!
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Take your paws off me!
For who?
Shoot to kill, I said.
A sight for sore eyes!
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Earl, you must never do that again.
It's true.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
What are you going to be then?
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
What about the tree?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
How long have you been running this place?
She's pretty cute.
Keep straight on this road here.
Should we stop?
Go around him.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
What are you laughing at?
Rise and shine.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Turn up this road.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I am sleepy.
What?
My brother says he likes you, too.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Who is it?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Ugnh.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
I'm buyin'.
Poker's not your game.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Thinking about what?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
How do we stand?
Well, here it's half.
You name it, we shoot it.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
When?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Why did you do that?
Where you been all day?
He knows. A lot.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Why don't you start with me?
That's who you are too, Emma.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
So, what do you do?
Are you all right?
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
Not listed, huh?
Any news on my wife?
How're we doing?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
That doesn't look much like a library.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
How did you get here?
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Now, who are all these people?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
He's afraid of something.
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
What is it...?
What?
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
Give me your hat...
It's sand.
Wait.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Be quiet.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
You just got a Mickey.
Sorry...
Well...
Not...complaining, actually.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Dinner...tonight.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
Yeah...I have to get away.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
You're taking "no" for an answer?
Hi, baby.
Yeah?
You ready...?
Is there any more rice...?
I don't understand.
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Oh, man.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
You believe that?
Where are you, anyway?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
I don't need it.
Is she Asian?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Getting married.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
We'll go into that some other time.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
Hey, Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
This looks like the best spot.
What's got into you?
I hope you got your money.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
Whatever you say, darling.
Yesif he is your husband.
The dame's too smart for him.
What!
Send it collect.
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Are we going away, Daddy?
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Virginia or Elizabeth?
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
She knows it's my case?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
What, I couldn't hear you?
He came by.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
You told em? You told em it's me?
You're fourteen years old here?
Where were you?
About five years ago.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Are you all right?
Hello.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
You think they're connected?
Did you look around the headboard?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
You come here often?
Everywhere, like a plague.
The army?
You see that?
Shit!
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Where are you going?
And what's with the headgear?
I'm sending you the files.
How do you open the damn door?
He's comin' up -- !
Don't forget these.
Now tell me something I don't know.
Where'd you get all this?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Coming right to us!
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
Viscera?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
No.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Yeah, like people in love.
...Pardon?
Adele... are you serious?
Can't hurt.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
All set?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
What happened?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Man, this guy is really good.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Right.
No.
You still having a problem with this?
You know her?
Let me speak to my daughter.
Now what?
You ready?
We got a problem?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
We need your help.
Fine.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
She must make a glaive.
I road them often in my youth.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
Look.
Rocket launcher.
The yellow and pink.
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Good morning.
Sarah -- with an H?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
You have Stromwell.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
And you know this for a fact?
Someone missed you.
What?
Neither.
Now I am.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
This is ogre's magic.
Why not mine the damned walls?
A good day for singing...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Wondrously so.
The fastest in the world.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Marco!
Mom?
I might not stay, anyway.
Mr. Stevens?
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I still don't know what that means.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Are you going to kiss me?
These are free papers.
Want me to come back some other time?
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
What is it?
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
Where did you get that?
Don't ever let go.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
You okay, man?
I'm, okay... You okay?
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
You like it?
What's bothering you, Madison?
All of it?
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
She was looking right at me.
You're alive?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
How did you get this?
What about your meeting?
Oh, please.
I feel weird asking him.
You bet the ponies?
Can you check?
It's ours.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Who you calling?
Edinburgh.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Is the program ready?
Let him finish.
If you want to tell me.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
[Where are you coming from?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
What are you doing here?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Hmmm?
He's not a cop killer.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
This is the kitchen.
You say something?
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Where?
Which hospital?
What?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
What John Doe?
Had any schooling?
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
What do you mean, too bad?
I don't know.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
What do you got on Korda?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
You tell me.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
McCall, you all right?
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
It's already started.
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
How long?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Someone you have to get back to?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Why?
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
NEW POWER COINS!!
I am the mighty ape!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Well...
No. They envy you.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Monkeybone?
Olive or eyeball?
You want to come inside?
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Mr. President! A point of order!
Fine--
*No*!
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
I know. It's--Violet.
You--don't know it, do you?
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Why don't you do it yourself?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
You're a fool, Babe.
You're acting like a school girl.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
You try it.
How is this, sir?
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
What is your name?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Tails tonight, sir?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
When did you start to feel this way?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
What about it?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
We're almost there.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Hey,... don't I know you?
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
Who's the artist?
Hi.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Yes -- what is it?
Separate bedrooms?
But you will not... be safe...
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
And, where did you see my portrait?
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
It works.
Huh?
I don't play for no team.
What is it?
All right, I'll do it.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Get moving.
Foreigners! Fuck!
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
Who?
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
You swore, Pearl!
The killer.
What!?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
Which lawyer?
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Then you don't want me to go there.
I will start with you.
Glorious, analytical...
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Go on.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
No, you didn't, Bob.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
And what am I doing?
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
Maybe I'll go ridin.
What'd you give for that thing?
...Where's the transponder?
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
I got this apartment with a guy.
The Five?
Doctor David Ravell.
What are those for?
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Waitaminute -
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Pete... I do apologize.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Who's the honcho around here?
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
I vote for the motel.
You stayed after all.
I don't want you to move.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Bullshit.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
And we're never getting in.
Can we come in?
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
What are you doing?
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Thank you.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
And the Governor?
Is it?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
God, that's fine.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Thank you, Louis.
I heard you tonight.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
I'll drop it!
I knew it.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
No.
Are you certain this is the right way?
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Of course, sir.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Daniel...
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
What is this person doing here?
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
How is her family going to feel about it?
My mistake - she's glaring.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
You try it.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
What do you mean?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
What do we do?
It's beautiful.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Hey. What are you doing?
I'll see you later.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Marquis? Is that you?
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
Who's to say I did not?
Of course.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
As for the author... shoot him.
Louis
Manolete?!
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Answer me when I talk to you.
Go 'head.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
You don't talk very much.
Jake...
You're not interested in him?
Hey, leave the kids alone.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
I can't do that.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
What a day I've had!
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
I'll rephrase the question.
Wasn't that close?
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
Excuse us a minute?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
What's he like?
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
You... you don't know me --
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
Ash?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Hot chocolate.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Tell me more about Cabot.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
How about California?
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Hello Brenda.
He's here.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Objection! Argumentative!
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Wait - there is that other favor.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
But she was here?
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Of course not.
What... what are these interviews about?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
Did you have sex before you were married?
No.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Why are you ashamed?
I have thought about it, yes.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
I just thought it might --
I was just trying to --
She didn't give you my address?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
How do we start?
Do you want me to stop calling?
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Mr. Millaney?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
Vance!  Vance Parker.
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
This is rose, right?
Where were you?
Me?
She got anything good?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
It makes me feel better.
Does it hurt?
How do they know it's over?
They'll read our minds!
Don't do it!
Paden sends his best.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
What brings you into my saloon?
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Where's the dog now?
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
One thing bothered me.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
What makes you think that?
Just help.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Sounds familiar.
Well, there goes our record deal.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
What is it?!!
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
What's he get if he wins here?
But you could get killed, right?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Anything?
Why are you stopping?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Do you want me to say I did it?
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
I DON'T KNOW!
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
That's fantastic.
You murdered her!
What will you say?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
What do you want?
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
What are you taking?
Gibarian was under enormous --
I don't know you...
You told her?
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
My ass if falling.
Not Koontz.
You coming in?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
What, want a glass?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Your dog ate it.
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
How did he get over there?
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Shut up, Animal!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Let me go! Let me go!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
You did?
We've all done a poor job of it.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Can I?
I don't understand.
Yes.  Thank you.
Report.
Maybe they're not out there.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
What you ask is difficult.
What I have done, I had to do.
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Uh -- what are they?
It never rains but when it pours --
I still don't under --
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
You're crazy -- !
I don't mean to intrude.
We'll be going to warp speed --
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Shields activated!
An experimental device, doctor.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
... I don't think he understands...
Find it?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
How long?
No choice now, Scotty!
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
Augh.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
What?
Why?
Wil... Data was down there.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Spoken by you?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Me?
What is it?
A computer canna lie, sir.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
But she's not the Enterprise.
Clarify that.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Gear shift.
I am husband?
Who?
Horses.
When do you have to be here?
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
What happened?
How long will it take you to get home?
Slow down, slow down.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
You talked to Iris?  When?
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Are we having a bad night?
That would be no.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
But why this pattern?
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Good.  I think about things.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
I know. I know.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
Bitch... You little bitch!
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
I'll think about it.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
I'm German-Irish.
You like spaghetti?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
What is it?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
That's a terrific idea.
What?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
My God.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
How long has he been there?
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Well, you want to or not?
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
What do you mean?
Why should it be grounded?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
What's the action around?
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
What are you doing?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Me too.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Why?
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Is there a young Tim?
Then what was it?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
They haven't harmed anyone.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Thank you.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
You did say birds?
Does this room look silly?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
We never met in court or anyplace else.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Will I be seeing you again?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
I think it's safe to get out now.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
You must leave this house.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
We won't.
What? What is it?
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Just passing through Santa Carla?
I'm my own man.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
I am?
Mom's home?...
Who are you calling?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Let's open it.
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Right.  Why not?
What if it doesn't come?
So, do we go on?
Why did they built it?
Say I just come back again?
Talk away, Professor.
My God...
Alex... people are staring.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
This... was my home.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
This is magnificent...
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
And roosters.
No, sir --
He said he traveled for two months.
[Beat] You're his son?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
How'd he get it?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
You're a bank robber?
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
His mother?
The sawbones?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Ho-ly shit.
So who's the lucky guy?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Holy shit...
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
So what've we got today?
Yeah.
Six rounds. 357.
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
What's he smoke in that?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
What ya want?
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
What does it mean?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
What are you doing?
Morning, Coogan.
Where's yours?
What do you want?
I want that fucker dead.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Let me go!
No options.
I think you better leave.
He's lying.
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
I might have an idea...
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Watch your ass, shithead.
How's she doing?
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
Do you have to do that?
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
-- Eddie...
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
And why was an exception made?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Where is the ring?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
You better dust this place, Sam.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
James...
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
This is going to drive the ante up.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Orthopedics?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Are you done?
This is Miss Costello...?
You know what happened.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
How are you holding up?
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
...four years ago...
Yes.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Can I read it?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Darker.  More...evil?
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Ninety-six.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Can we talk?
You all right?
Who is it Philip?
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Well, that was neighborly.
What are you blubbering about?
Why should it?
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
You knew my daddy?
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
There's worse places, honey.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Thank you.
I just wanted a little sip.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Yes, Hannah?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
You heard? How?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
And the jacket?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Foreman now.
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
Do you know what "normal" is?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Neither am I.
How you guys doing?
I'm taking you back out.
I think you were worried about me.
Jesus, Lindsey--
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
You totaled it, huh?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
It's divine!
I'm not coming.
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
First thing that comes to your mind?
Who?
Like what?
Why?
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Larry...
What man had access to her?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, Dear God...
You lied to me
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Yeah.
Oh, it's all right.
Leave them drums alone.
Ever seen one of these before?
We're nearly there, sir.
Hello, Grandfather!
And my nose...
Well!
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
I have recorded the transmission.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
Where are you?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Whoa, wait a minute...
Still got him?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
I don't think I'm going.
Just slipped your mind.
Bill!
You've already met.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Find out.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Why not?
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
When's the audition?
I'll never get out of here in time.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Hey... very tense.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
One minute but then--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
--I saw him. He verifies.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
What are we gonna hear?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
That's not why we're going out.
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Dad!!
Let me know.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
What?
Andy...
Not you too -
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Who are you, child?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Well... thank you again.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
What's- It's me, open up.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
God, it's so clean out here.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Bad?
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
Just give me the license, please.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
So who won?
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
I never put myself in harm's way.
So?
We closed.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
Don't get it.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Yes, she is.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Everyday.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
So what makes you so special?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
...I should?
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
One more?
What is it?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Last night?
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Oh, yes. Thanks.
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
Any of that coffee left?
What do you think?
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
What unit were you with ?
Sometimes.
What are we doing here?
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
What the hell is it?
No, sir.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
What's that?
Let's go.
Be careful, okay?
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Oh, please...
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
What the heck are those for?
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
No. Please, don't force him.
Sure thing.
Did you... do something to him?
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Hello, Robert.
You're one of them, aren't you?
Why?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
They're worth less points.
Perfect!
My God! What happened?
There shooting at something.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
You will wish you hadn't.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are responsible...What has happened?
Yeah.
What's with the friggin numbers?
I'll take a chance.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
But if you could, you would?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Hi.
You want to go for a ride?
You smoke Pall Mall?
You didn't walk out here.
Planet 10?
What crate?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Where're you goin'?
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
I'm a writer. Ted O 
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Sound a little what?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
How about the coke?
My wife used to call me that.
When did you write it?
Yes.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
What kind of drugs?
You look like dogshit.
Keep your three o'clock.
Cool.
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Hey  Willie Mays.
What's your name, man?
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
You buy this "blurry" business?
Ten, nine...
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
Letters in the alphabet.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
La'chiem.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Do you sail?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Chief, look!
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Stepmother's...
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Did you lose something?
He does...?
... Good night, Chauncey.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Please, sir.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
I can certainly understand that...
It's that gardener!
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
I want to try.
What about Maxine?
Suck my dick!
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Can I get you a drink?
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
There ain't.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Howdy do, Dude.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Huh?
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
No.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude.
Yeah, but--
What is it with you people and pain?
And so will we.
Nomak?
You used me as bait?!
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
LaMagra --
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
Jesus.
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
I don't know yet.
Does it hurt?
What movies?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
It's <u>freezing</u>.
What the fuck--??
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
Why?
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Why didn't you get into bed?
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
What "what"?
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
I asked first.
I'll call you.
Oh no.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
What happened to him?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
What did you see?
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Good to see you, son.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Mirtha.
I don't think so.
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
What type of planes do you have?
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
Alright.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Yeah?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Nice weed, huh?
Read it.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Three fifteen.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
What do you have in your purse?
Are you going to represent me?
Do you think I did it?
That's not an answer.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
This is not relaxing.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
I don't know.
Well, I can help.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Oh, that's nice.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Francesca?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Yeah?
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
What it will be.
And what's that?
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
He didn't see you, did he?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
It's not here, Caesar.
Now that's teamwork.
How many'd you do?
Who?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Do you know him?
Five years is a long time.
Yes.
That's his brother.
Where will you be?
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
That's what I'm saying.
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Jack?... Jack?
It does doesn't it?
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
I think I'd remember that.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Where you going?
He got better.
Whadda we bring?
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
What are you doing here?
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Look at the size of it!
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
You know what that proves?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
You're gonna shoot me!
You're the guys from the movie!
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
Am I in trouble or something?
Yeah... She's okay, though.
And Spring Fling.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Crash...I want you.
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
You missed the tag!
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Little high.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
...been right, but who knows?
Hey!
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
You should say so.
Yeah.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Why're you crying?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
...and hypocrisy.
Can I go in?
Hey!
Come on. I'm sorry.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
God-damn..
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
The 405 is coming up.
He's back, Col
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Why?
Am I becoming repetitious?
Come on.
You said anything, Dil
What's Fergus?
Dil!!!
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Why?
Who's Dil?
The best.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
I believe you.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
No.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
I'm not fifteen.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
Forty-five thousand.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Go on.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
You're grounded Friday night!
Not much further.
You ok?
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
We're clear.
You stole this truck!
...-damn!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
He's crazy!
Forty-nine point four.
All right 
Sorry.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
You.
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
...about--
"Went away."  I like that.
And let me guess.  You failed.
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Iced coffee.
Quite a getup for jacking...
 ...that tunnel.
Lying? 
...gotta seal it.
What about her?
I'll throw that in too.
I'd like to talk to him.
Isn't that your number?
I want the rest of the pictures.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
What does it look like?
Did you get some sleep?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
That's good. Now what's her name?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Neither do I.
You're still beautiful...
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Who else you been to see?
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
A chicken?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
You don't want to know.
All four?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Thirty-seven!
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Oh, my god.
Shut the hell up.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
No way!
Now I know you're lying.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
What?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
What do you mean?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
What did he say?
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Remember the first time we came up here?
You're looking at him.
You got what we need?
Great, sir. Great.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
What about that?
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
Collateral damage.
Jazz.  Music.
Let's go.
Who's Heller?
Just relax.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Back where?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
I didn't realize I was out.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
How do you mean?
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
Here's the Patrol.
Whatcha got?
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
What's that siren?
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
What is it?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
Furnished?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
I only have your word for that.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
Sounds boring.
Who are you waiting for?
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Do you know her?
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
I'll give them to you.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Nothing.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
What do you mean?
What do I do then?
And then I can go home?
I'm pretty sure she did.
She bought it.
I don't find this very funny,
Who are you calling?
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Did you hit her?
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Get rid of him!
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
You didn't say it.
I need something to keep me awake.
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
In there.
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Your name is John White.
I'm sorry.  About before.
How much do you usually get paid?
I'm not certain about...
Choices???
Till what?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
The Fidelity nonsense...
You're kidding.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
I know. I'm sorry...
Tonight?
What'dya get?
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Oh..
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Who's full of shit?
I thought that was it.
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
No, I --
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
You're going hunting?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
It's ahead, by the tree.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
You sure?  I can help you.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
You all right?
Hi.
You're lying.
You know that you're in my house.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Never mind. What's your name?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Mary --
Jabez -- Jabez!
You know that, son.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
You're very perceptive.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Go on.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I don't have a choice.
What kind of things, Leon?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
Really? Did you play in a band?
So?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
Where are you going?
I'm listening.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
You're it.
You have beautiful eyes.
No one knows?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
Hey you two. Lights out.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Liet?
You mustn't speak of...
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Should I call a doctor?
You'll be sitting on the right.
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Tor, I should be getting home.
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
What are you making?
You said that.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
No.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
She could've been a nurse.
So...?
Page three of the Post.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Kinda'.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Sign here, please.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Mr. M.?
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
How'd she meet Patchett?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
More or less.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
A vulgar term, but yes.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
On what evidence?
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Have we met before?
What'd he give to you?
Here?
Was he with anyone?
Who?
Any idea what he looks like?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Sure, go ahead.
What?
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Yes?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Who are his ghosts?
Hello.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
So I follow the wires?
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Darling, Peter says I could stay
What are you talking about?
We've got to catch him in the act.
What the hell do I do now?
It's one way.
And--
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
The Mask. Where is it?
Peoples China Bank.
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
And you can't?
I did.  Both.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
When'd they file the demur?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Hey -- those are my files --
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
I'm looking for someone.
Give me that!
The temperature is dropping too fast.
That's right.
They're moving away.
What are you afraid of?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
What??
That they are.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
All right, so I made another deal.
Arthur.
You saved me from the arrow...
A lovestruck page!
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
Would you like some more coffee?
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
No, is Regan aware of it?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Mr. Dennings?
Let the enemy have no power over her.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
What d'ya got?,
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
The Royal.
What disease?
Come on.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
You're kidding me.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
He do that every year?
The both of them?  In there?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
John.  It's good to see you.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Who is this?
Which ear was it?
When did you start smoking?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
No...
Mr. Mintz.
Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Like the dress...?
Excuse me?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
What?
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
They're ready for you, sir.
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
I found a broken gasket, from space --
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
We can't take a second more.
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Huh?
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Well... yah.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Carl somethin'?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Your mallard?
Yah.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
That's the idea -- we split them.
You hear that?
I'm sorry, I...
This is how I met --
No, I...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
One minute.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Really?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
What's going on here?
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
That guy's not going to make it.
Hello, John.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
He's not a moron.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
You a friend of Parry's?
Can I help you?
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Please don't hurt me?
Parry.
What's her name?
Holdin' my penis...
You a fag too?
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm sorry.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
You're lucky.
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
You find the source?
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
A .357.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Yes?
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Jazz, we're talking here.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
He did.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
I swear, Satch.
You ready?
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
Nah, just working the job.
Who are you?
It's dark down there.
Derek... stop.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
What's goin' on?
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Well?
Are you crazy?!
Where's the radio?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Rennie...
I opened thousands of brains.
We must abandon.
We must abandon.
Guys ready to order?
We must abandon.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
A thousand things.
How come you got the kid with you?
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
You almost sound like you believe that.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
What will happen to the others?
I'm in a hurry.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
We better stick here till tonight.
I want to say something.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Yeah. I got out.
What do you have in mind?
What did he say?
What about the brakes?
I made a mistake.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Who paid you to see me off?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
You don't look it.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Shelly: get in the office.
Yes.  I hear you.
Excuse me...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
When?
Ricky, I...
Did you see my present for you?
What if we don't pay?
Oh, 'scuse me.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
It might show.
What the hell are you talking about?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
What was that about?
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
You are much too human.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
I guess ...
You look good...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
You?
You hear me?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
--That edge!
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Seems like it's going well.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
Why there?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Yes, I do.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Free?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Think she'll hold?
Yes, ma'am.
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
You do not.
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
What do you want?
Wait a minute--
I have to get my head back into my work.
How did you get this job?
I have a way with animals.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Nothing.
How was the dinner?
What did he say?
What was I saying?
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
And what's he do?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Thank you.
Are you two okay?
You think she stands a chance?
Brady!
When did this happen?
Hi.
Where are you going?
Annie, was that you?
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I don't want to.
I've given them his profile.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Ohh!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Why are you so upset?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Hold up a minute...
What would <u>that</u> be?
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
My scar is a war-wound.
The girl needs help.
You should get Married.
Fine, thank you, but
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Oh, I have to hear this.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
What are you doing?
It doesn't work on small animals!
Perrier water!
We're breaking up. I am out!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
What?
Poor Father . . .
But that's not true! I've got one.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
I understand... I won't-
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
You okay?
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Where are these toys of yours?
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
As long as you keep remembering why.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
How was lunch?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
France.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
Do you love me, Conner?
I don't know.
You stayed here again last night?
Is there anything else you need?
What'd you find out?
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
Talley?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
I need to work out some stuff.
Are civilians inside?
Chief, Mikkelson.
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
Lets go, Jock.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
'Less the place really is haunted.
Cheery looking bunch.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Where does this amulet come from?
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
You gonna buy?
Alex!
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
I got gas, Bennie.
...No money.
But, Mrs. Rand --
But it's so far away...
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I told you.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
What you been up to?
-- 73
When worlds collide.
Do it again.
How much closer would you say you were?
You and Kay were like sisters?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
Why always on this night?
But you're the fairest by far.
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
She's no vampire.
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Read her thoughts.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Say yes.
Okay, okay. You're right.
I'm the King of the World.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
No way.
Cancer in a box.
Be careful, Julie.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Julie?
You sure?
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
Do you mind if I go with you?
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Get that ladder up here.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Hi, Daddy.
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
Violet Bick!
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
There is nothing to discuss.
Do you?
Hurry, please.
Go on, Doctor.
My imagination isn't that good.
No, we'll go through here.
You don't have to prove anything.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
I think they'll come out now.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Dad died from a heart attack....
You're having a good time....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I stuck them on, man....
How many?
I wish you wouldn't say that....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Who grows more beautiful....
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
What color was it?
... this is... uh... too funny...
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
I think so.
Beautiful.
Gorgeous.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
Jerry --
Sorry.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
We need to keep moving.
We need to head for the coast.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I could come with you.
Where do you think you're going?!
What's he got in there?
No.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Are you sure?
No. We can't.
Tim!  Lex!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
It's still on.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Doesnit sleep?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
Will you do me a favor then?
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
He's grubbing for money, father.
Oh no, I don't think --
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Yes?
Somewhere in between.
I was not a failure.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
What the hell is this?
John?
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
We must go, Holiness.
Where are you from?
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Yes.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
It seems like we're getting lower.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
You take care.
With crocodiles... everything's even.
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
You sure?  I don't mind...
Yes.
<u>You</u>?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Are you finished?
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
I have no doubt of it.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
No. Tell me why.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
The Ottawa are gone.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
DeJesus!  A readout!
That was a loud one wasn't it?
Thank you, Martin.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Tom, this is our case.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
So you knew this young man before?
PDA?
Right.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Murdered him?
Nice-looking kid.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Uh-huh.
Who did this?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
What did you find?
Oh God.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Oh, hi.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Hans was very attentive to you.
Hospital?
Hair stuff?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
I'll bet.
Hello?
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
And he's fine, girl.
I know.  But chances are...
What's up?
But?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Just something I'm trying.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Funny.  I never did.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
Hey, girl.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
Yeah, hey. Chad.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
I need to sit down.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Kind of.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Jimmy, did you touch her?
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
What is that?
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Yeah?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Something Lecktor said.
Not yet.
I'll see you later. All right?
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
Hello, hotshot!
Hello.
What do you want?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
I don't believe in God.
You must take a little pleasure in it.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Hi...
Each show is worse than the next.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
We had a deal!!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
... yes.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
No, you're not.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Yeah.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
What do you mean?
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
I don't like cake.
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
In my sleep.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
He said that?
You're violating the laws of the universe.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
This is crazy --
No, it was so right it scares me.
30.
What makes you think he's my friend?
I like your car.
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
You think you can bargain with me?!
I wasn't helping you for money.
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
We want it back.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Red light, green light, Jos?
Yeah.
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
Yeah...?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
What d'you want?
You know where they are?
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
What?
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Where is it?
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
- you who don't have a conscience.
'Terrorists?'
We've lost enough agents for one night.
I thought I was going to see Max.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Try it again.
Have I been a good wife?
The guy died.
Here.
No, I'll tell him.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
What the hell happened to you?
I know.
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Are you sure he's got one?
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Why?
I don't want land.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
... I Bet you're gay.
What?
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
What brings you here?
She'll never understand it.
You are well?
I came as quickly as I could.
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
Who told them that?
Now what seems to be the problem?
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
SLIP-STREAM.
Our time's up.
What the fuck is that?!
So tell me you're okay, then.
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Nice wallets.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
And you believe that ?
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Trust is earned not given away.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
Bruce has just awaken.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I'm glad you're here.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Hello.
I guess you have.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
He was caressing.
You're Nick's mother?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Really?
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
You don't like it?
Kiss me.
Are they ready yet?
I like the freak show.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
She's shy.
Maybe black means you're happy?
THIS!! 
Jump in the water!!
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
You think...
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
You miss her, huh?
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
Michael...
Because I could come...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
What?
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
What kind?
How long have you been with them?
Do you ever do any writing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
An album.
You want a ride into town?
Got me an audition tonight.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
You got something you want to do?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
How come you never talk?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Rollin'...and speed!
Who's going to buy me a beer?
'You Duff Anderson?
And his age?
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
So I been told.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Is he going to make it?
YOU DID.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Oh my god.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Taste it.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
Help me with this thing!
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
'Morning.
What's that?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Who would know where they were hidden?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
Freddy.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
How are you doing?
Excuse me?
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Excuse me.
Bella -- this is Anna.
Ahm... room service.
Well?
Spike!
Excuse me.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Yeah, kid?
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
There they are!
Yeah, where we going?
I'm the coach!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
What are they?
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
At this hour?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
You're sure...
Good.
You were saying...
So were you.
Sure.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
So?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
How old are you?
Yeah--
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
Wow... .
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Boy, you must've been up early.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin' take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros  away and you're a great big hunk of nothing  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
Your pleasures of course!
You better hope there is.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Then it is some service you desire of us.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
He called the day he escaped.
Did you know that when you married him?
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
Don't leave me.
Thanks for your help.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
The flight?
I can tell.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Faux goose down.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
I wish she could forget him.
Then wh-where do we land?
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
What if the Japanese did invade?
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
We're here on the sofa bed...
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Is something wrong?
Who was that?
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
I'm not ready to die.
I'm ready...
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
We proceed, representing your estate.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Yes.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
He used that?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
One is all?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
And pointless.
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Sustained.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
You lame Taylor?
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
How did you meet him?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
We try to be decent.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Who told you my name?
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
What's this?
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
You approve!
Hold those rights.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
Ever done this before?
Where's Roach?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
What do you want?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Why us?
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Yeah, what?
You'll like it fine.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Now?
-- yes --
We're really in a terrible rush.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
What do you mean?
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Do it!  Do it!
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
What?
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
What thing?
Where... can I stay?
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Why don't you go away?
Phoenix?
Norman took a wife?
What's that?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Where'd you get the stag hound?
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Why am I doing this?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Don't mention it.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
Now you listen to me, Rose --
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Rose, what are you doing up?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I got an awful bad cold.
Yes, dear, what is it?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Sons of bitches!
Where you gonna be?
That's him alright.
Maybe.
Yeah... great.
I'm gonna get beside him.
That's not true.
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Feeling
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
I always knew you was pretty.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Don't do that again!
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What was I gonna say?
Rice is a bum.
Whatta' those?
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
...I can't haul meat no more.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Farewell, my cuz.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
And so did I.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
We kept it...
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
He's company.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
Because I don't walk away.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
You said that last time!
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Are you hungry?
What the hell is that?
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
Follow the Rich White Man?
Pick it up!
Master Ching taught me.
You have one of these?
How'd what go?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
I would like one of my people to help.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
Rub your ears.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Does it matter?
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
What?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Like do you believe in heaven?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Oh.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
I can't leave.
What's this?
I've got a hot one.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
He's the only one I told.
Nervous?
Tom, let's spend the night here.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
A private, sir?
Good luck, John.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
He ain't Wade.
What about the company?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
No, sir.
How fast?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Visit her at the home.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
All right, okay, let's talk.
Scherner told me something else about you.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Pots and pans.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
And white.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
What do you want?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
Are you sure?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Who's phone?
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Yes.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
What do you want?
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
...leave me alone... please...
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
You owe my mother.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Jesus, this place is packed.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
I don't believe it.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
It's my wife.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
He's preaching.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
That don't make 'em kin...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
You didn't tell her!
Ah
Are you writing?
No, your marriage bed.
Your Majesty
My lady Viola.
I have spoken with your father.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
No, not that.
I won't be able to.
What? Yes, that's fine.
Cameron.
What sort of car?
Hello. Hello.
No, nothing, sorry.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
Hello.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
I suppose so.
Lester.
No, I know.
Yeah.
You do it.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
-- where'd you go?
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Jill says nothing.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
I don't want to fight, George.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
When?
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
I wanna hear about it, George.
They get hair all over the place.
Here.
Danny?
But eh what was the matter with him?
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Rattling. Rustling.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Was it a prescription?
What if I say no?
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Hopeless I
Van Cartier.
What?
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Then one day they find you.
A sweater.
Ice cream!
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
Maybe you should take this.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
This is farewell.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
She is guilty.
I'll see you, Bill.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Who did you kill?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Huh?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
He just got out of the state hospital.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Like me, too.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I figured he had a right to know.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
And?
And started to run.
Good thinking.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
You must think I like losing.
Okay. 
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Like when?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
Men!
Brains aren't everything.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
The most wonderful thing happened -
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
Does Kat know?
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
Why the fuck not?
Suck my balls.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I can't believe he's dead.
What's going on, Chef?
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
WHAT?
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
What's going on Terrance?
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Getting drunk is no solution.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Anna...
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
What about bowling?
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
I came here to have a word with your dad.
I can't tell you, Theo.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Ted?  Captain?
What?
What's that?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
But --
You're insane.
Shut up, Beth --
I promise --
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
When did it come across?
Where's it coming from?
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
How are the others?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
See Threepio... do you copy?
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Don't be a hero...
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
The people in New Hampshire.
You haven't heard of it.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
Thank you.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Press still works.
Bobby, don't say anything.
Mornin, sister.
<u>Bobby</u>...
I'm very sorry I...
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
...we don't have thirteen at table...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
Ben!  What's wrong?
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
I hope it's the right kind.
You don't like his friends.
I don't want to say goodbye.
No.  I think it's ugly.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Look, you've never liked me...
Small world.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
So whaddya think?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Ni...
No, not really.
So what's going on?
How many?
Go fuck yourself...
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Right.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Where'd they get you?
That's the point.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Good.
Sure.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
A Porsche.
Yes, you asshole.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
What feelings?
No, I don't.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
So who are you?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Get off my roof!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Holy shit.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
Oh... What are you working on?
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
Give me your coat.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
I wouldn't know.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
How is she?
Got a title?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Like it?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Is this how?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Lucy; come back!
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Who is she?
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
A "complimentary corsage."
Who ????
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Why didn't you go before we left?
Superman! The --
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Where's Clark?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
The one Superman wrecked up?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
This??
Shut up.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
It must feel great.
Luthor  --
Are you sure?
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
How was it?
Is this mine?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
We do.
Are you expensive?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
What took so long?
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Not being partial, are you?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
This sort of thing!
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
Why me...?
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
I'm sorry.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I'm sorry.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
You don't talk to me like that.
Clean out your locker.
I'm so sorry.
There's a ladder here.
Okay.
No!  I'm sick of this...
Then, what good are you?
Originally, Connecticut.
Really?
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
You did?  How is he?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
What did it smell like?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Is she asleep?
Why?
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
I might've been away for the weekend.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Been away a lot.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
You do?
I don't get it.
I miss my kids.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Thanks.  You, too.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Uh-huh.
...You know... who *who* is?
Rye.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Dave.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
No.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
--Darling--
Yes.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
Do I know you?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
And where are they going with it?
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
That's a secret.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Oh, you did.
So from there to there?
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Too difficult?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
You're right.  You're fired.
This is a great pleasure.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
I don't have one.
It's okay.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Then, tell me a story.
There won't be any need for that sir.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
This is for "mama and the kids."
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Doc -- something you said the other day --
You know Charlie How-Come?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
The word for those things is croissants.
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Maybe I dont.
What are you talking about?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...
What did the king say?
To be killed in battle?
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
My captains have sworn their support.
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
God asked you to do something?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Really?
Henryk's in there.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
See and raise 1,000.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
You got nothin' on me.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Not without a warrant.
He telephoned me today.
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Why are you saying it?
You worked here?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
You got no reason to do that!
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
Where the hell is it!?
If they land--
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
First Wes, now you?
Oh, God...
What do we do?
People are suffering.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
What's going on....what are you doing?
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
You don't know that!
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Why do you do it?
So cut both.
What is that?
What about the ballistics report?
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Sir...
No.
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
What shade of powder do you use?
That's too dark.
I'll be delighted.
And you're going to fall for them.
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Goodbye...
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
You're certain?
Now it's worse.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Well, I'll be--!!!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Say--wait a minute!
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
That's too bad.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
What's the matter, Mary?
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
--you'd go with him!
I was in his cabin--
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Listen, I want to talk to you.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
What's wrong, Doc?
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
That a fact?
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
What the hell does that do?
What do you make of all this?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
I could swear I heard my son call me.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
There.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
What if every country legalized at the same time?
What are you doing?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Well, I've not brought them.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Are you getting out much?
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Why?
This had better be good.
With a starship!
Following new course. Warp seven.
Bob?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Yes, Captain.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
A User -- in our world?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Yes, MCP.
What is it?
We have to get off this beam!
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
What?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
Are we going to die?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
What?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Elliot what?
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Where's everybody else?
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
I'm really not very -
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You want me to rob him?
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
He no!
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
One way, or round trip?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Accident.
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Live there?
Nice office you've got.
Two-hundred dollars.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
You never did answer my question.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Yeah.
I can't see it.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
I busted my leg!
Morning, officer.
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Son of a bitch!
I'm listening.
When?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
How much did you take off?
I know now.
Well, go get it then.
Books. He's my biographer.
I could run off them whores.
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
What for?
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
I don't kill nobody without him. 
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
D'you find an apartment?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
What are you going to do?
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
A single hour.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Will you, Judy?
But why? Why here?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Oh, yes!
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Is she pretty?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
What's that?
More.
We have to get going.
Fuck you Boyd!
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
I don't think so Boyd.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Florist?
Not padded ones.
Where did you get that?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
Pup corn?
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
You must think I'm mad.
There's been an accident.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Have I slept long?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
<u>Nashville</u>...?
You're tired, Ronnie.
Oh, Lord....
"...where's my pill..."
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
William Schuman.  Old Shoe.  U.S. Army.  Serial number, 21-31-2841-262.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
Do it later...  Okay,  now, "The Little Girl," who is she, what is she doing?  She is....she's ...Okay, okay, it's an Albanian village... She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
What would be true, then.
...by you?
....beautiful.
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
Another cup of coffee?
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Sarah listen to me.
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
How?
When...when will she be back?
Who?
Seance.
Okay.  Okay.
Did you call the police?
Who did?
How can you be sure?
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
To love, you must be able to feel.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
So what do you do?
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
See? Did you see that?
Someday, I'll find out.
Get them together.
You're way ahead of me again?
Who exactly ARE you?
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
You called the cops on us?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
Did you try to fight him?
Then what?
It's our job, Gloria.
Okay, what's the matter?
Don't forget the car wash.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Yes.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
God in heaven, what is that?!
This is something.
They look like acorns.
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Where's Timmy and Buck?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
They kid a lot.
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Oh --
Oh -- Oh --
That's right.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Mother of God.
Warm.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Thanks.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Toadies right behind.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Sorry, "dude".
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Anything else I can get you?
If necessary.
Now that's Magneto talking.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Love me?
Darling!?!
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
How's it going?
Would you like a sandwich?
Ooh!
Oh, doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
