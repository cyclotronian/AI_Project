i &apos;ve taken pity on you ,  my angel .  i heard your wish . 
but he &apos;s all right ?

what do you mean ? 
why ,  matt ! 
what &apos;s the matter ?  what &apos;s going on here ?   this is ridiculous !  you can &apos;t hold this boy on a vague suspicion .

i &apos;m sorry ,  cole . 
still smells fishy . 
oh ,  lord ,  the dance hall girl at bunty &apos;s .  .  . 
how &apos;d it go in there ? 
allow a man his version of the past .  when you get to be my age ,  you &apos;ve got enough painful memories ,  you &apos;re allowed to soften a few of the edges up . 
let the law  -  -

mmm . 
oh .  that &apos;s nice to know .   we &apos;re going to hang you ,  you know .

i hate you !  i hate you !  i wish i was never artificially created in a lab . 
we don &apos;t judge here . 
we don &apos;t label people here ,  scott . 
people ,  too . 
a slight miscalculation  -  -  my face was burned beyond recognition .  fortunately my research into plastics came in handy  .  .  . 
congratulations ,  you &apos;ve penetrated a bastion of male privilege .  i guessed you weren &apos;t a stickler for tradition ,  doctor . 
do you ? 
but
insane  .  .  .   ? 
you know how that makes me feel ,  deb ?  wanta know how that makes me feel ?   angry ,  deb .   yesss ,  that &apos;s the word ,  angry .  but if he makes you happy ,  you go right ahead .  i want you to be happy ,  deb .   no matter what ,  no matter how angry it makes me ,  no matter how much it hurts .  be happy ,  deb .  be oh ,  so very ,  very happy . 
this has been quite a night .  here &apos;s a thought .  why don &apos;t we go home and give our private parts a workout ? 
park view hotel ,  room 1002 .

brian . 
if you weren &apos;t at least the 300th person to ask me that ,  i &apos;d probably be pissed .   boy ,  you sure know it &apos;s a man &apos;s world sometimes .  .  . 
see that trap door up there ?  that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse - drawn engines .  it was pretty different then .  .  .  but kinda the same ,  y &apos;know ? 
temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees ,  but copper wire in outlet is melted ,  which requires 5000 degrees .  an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees ,  hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire . 
every little boy &apos;s fantasy . 
what &apos;s wrong ,  stephen ?   c &apos;mon ,  you only beat up the roof when something &apos;s on your mind .   how &apos;s brian doing ? 
 -  -  burn them . 
we still haven &apos;t found a connection between the victims . 
it &apos;s horrible .  they burned her breasts with cigarettes .  christ . 
yeah . 
it &apos;s still my money .  if you want to have a chance at any part of it ,  shithead ,  you will take my $120 , 000 and bet on tomorrow &apos;s game . 
i don &apos;t got it .  not tonight .  you can &apos;t get blood from a stone . 
 -  -  that there was never any other way it could have gone .   never any other way .  so you had better just put in my fucking bet .  $120 , 000 on the last game .  the big one .  come on !  are you a bookmaker ,  or fucking what ?

this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family . 
dorothy might love me or not ,  as she likes ,  but best will have to fight me before he marries her ! 
look here ,  roderick ,  my boy; this is silly business .   the girl will marry best ,  mark my words; and as sure as she does ,  you &apos;ll forget her .   you are but a boy .   best is willing to consider you as such .   dublin &apos;s a fine place ,  and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month ,  here are twenty guineas at your service .   make best an apology ,  and be off . 
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name ,  by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office . 
your name is lazlo zilagyi ? 
for whom else have you worked ? 
very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs . 
you will do as you please .   it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other .   do you not agree ? 
sir ,  let those laugh that win . 
what about you ,  wandering around alone ?  at least we have an alibi  -  - 
he was sickly .  had that shaking thing ,  whatd &apos;yacall it ,  epoxy ?

you &apos;re not responding to the stimulus .   i can see right here ,  i &apos;m not getting a reading . 
maybe you &apos;re fed up ,  maybe you want to be by yourself  -  -  who knows .   so you look down and see a tortoise .   it &apos;s crawling towards you .  .  .

but in this day and age i believe what they do is .  .  .  necessary .  i feel it is .  .  .  correct . 
you &apos;re right . 
i don &apos;t think we need any keys ,  dignan .  i think i can hotwire a car for us .

this is where we &apos;re finding most of the hemorrhaging .  the outer lining of the cerebral cortex . 
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr .  miller took his shirt off  -  - 
hey ,  uh ,  don &apos;t go freaking out on me over this ,  but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera ? 
let me ask you a question .  just a little one that &apos;s been gnawing at me for years . 
off to change everyone &apos;s life again ,  is that it ?  maybe this time you &apos;ll pop up in some mansion while i wind up in tijuana doing the donkey act . 
i was just somewhere else  -  -  how did i get here ? 
leave us alone you sick fuck ! 
meant no offense . 
what did i say about mentioning that bitch ? 
i recognize you from the news photographs ,  monsieur laszlo . 
now you finish locking up ,  will you ,  carl ? 
my german &apos;s a little rusty . 
your unexpected visit isn &apos;t connected by any chance with the letters of transit ?  it seems that as long as i have those letters i &apos;ll never be lonely . 
please .  please listen to me .  if you knew what really happened ,  if you only knew the truth  -  - 
 -  -  all right .  i tried to reason with you .  i tried everything .  now i want those letters .  get them for me . 
put them on the table . 
when will he be back ? 
does he always leave so early ? 
very well ,  herr laszlo ,  we will not mince words .  you are an escaped prisoner of the reich .  so far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us .  you have reached casablanca .  it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca . 
you see what i mean ?  if laszlo &apos;s presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration ,  what more will his presence in casablanca bring on ?  i advise that this place be shut up at once . 
make it ten .  i am only a poor corrupt official . 
yeah ,  you were saying ? 
as i suspected ,  you &apos;re a rank sentimentalist . 
get me the radio tower ! 
where is she ?  have you seen her ? 
what did it matter if fedex was five minutes late one day ?   the next day we just start over again . 
chuck . 
doc ,  i &apos;m not on the island .   i &apos;m not on the raft .   i &apos;m alive .   i &apos;m so glad to be back ,  i can &apos;t tell you .   i just want out of here . 
must have taken a hell of a long time . 
you &apos;ve been over the line and you came back .   you &apos;ve been saved ,  hallelujah ! 
not just that .   take your time .   use it .  live it . 
oh ,  just stop it !  you knew this was going to happen .  he &apos;s a young man . 
but you &apos;ve studied with the old man for *years* ! 
daddy ,  it &apos;s a letter to *me* . 
the screen is enormous !  imagine king kong up *there* !  have you seen a lot of movies here ? 
privacy is exactly the point of drive -  in movies . 
wally thinks apples are boring . 
there !  you said it was boring . 
i don &apos;t know !  he &apos;s just leaving -  -   you &apos;re the one who says he needs to see the world !   *that &apos;s* what he &apos;ll do -  - he &apos;ll see the world ! 
it looks like you bit it -  - it &apos;ll be all right . 
what i mean is ,  if you don &apos;t want to .  .  .  keep the baby ,  i know a place where you can go . 
and some new clothes . 
and we got rid of the red head . 
he &apos;s wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom .  you believe this ? 
aces ,  suits . 
and your lady ? 
i don &apos;t like it . 
nothing about you . 
it &apos;s against the rules .  dealers are forbidden to talk to punters . 
he doesn &apos;t gamble . 
she &apos;s my baby . 
that hair will have to go . 
what &apos;s he doin &apos; ? 
the key ! 
the only thing which exists is myself . 
come on ,  doolittle ,  give it a name . 
veil nebula . 
phoenix asteroids ?  never heard of  &apos;em . 
or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is . 
you got a lotta nerve . 
you said you could help . 
maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe ,  sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation .   but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden .   wasn &apos;t s &apos;posed to ,  but it did .   and it &apos;s back to the law of the jungle .   you got your predators and you got your victims . 
who is it ? 
craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him . 
probably a touch of what &apos;s going around . 
catch you back at the wall . 
really ? 
what happens if you level with her ? 
true ,  but -  - 
i want you on call here . 
jeremiah ? 
i feel like such an idiot .  why didn &apos;t i just say something a year and a half ago ?  man ,  think of how much time we wasted . 
cool . 
yeah . 
what was his name ? 
how much longer is this gonna last ? 
what &apos;d you do ,  donnie ?  what &apos;d you do ! 
it &apos;s a good thing the school was flooded today . 
it &apos;s like this big force .  .  .  that &apos;s in your brain .  but sometimes it grows bigger .  .  .  and it spread down into your arms and legs .  .  .  and it just sends you someplace . 
they suspended me for two days . 
time is running out .  we have to go see grandma death .  we have to talk to her . 
yes .  i flooded my school .  .  .  and i burned down that pervert &apos;s house .  i think i only have a few days left .  .  .  before they catch me . 
i think so .  i think that &apos;s one of the clues .  it &apos;s a clue that tells us .  .  .  to keep going . 
where are we going ,  donald ? 
mommmm !  i &apos;ll be right behind you in the hearse ! 
oh c &apos;mon ,  i love  &apos;em ,  but you know they only had me  &apos;cause peter needed a kidney .

what &apos;s wrong ? 
hold on ,  what &apos;s this  &quot; gravitational distortion ?  &quot; 
we don &apos;t get the power back ,  our air &apos;s gonna go bad . 
maybe one of the original crew ? 
who ? 
miller .  .  . 
a straight line . 
the reactor &apos;s still hot .  we &apos;ve got several small radiation sources ,  leaks probably .  nothing serious . 
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like out there .  walking around like some kind of circus freak .  people staring ,  whispering  -  - 
what &apos;s wrong with me ? 
my shift ends at four ,  but i couldn &apos;t  -  - 
what ?  no .  i &apos;m trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms . 
i &apos;m driving . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  sis ,  for leaving you guys  -  - 
how &apos;s the ipo ? 
you should be able to bend light around other objects ,  even people ,  if you could control your emotional state better  -  - 
there were a lot of variables to consider  -  - 
ben &apos;s still out there  -  - 
victor ,  your scar  -  - 
brad ,  can i talk to you a minute ? 
brad ,  i really fuckin &apos; hate mcdonald &apos;s ,  man .  ever since they started in with the chicken ,  everything went downhill . 
well ,  i believe you have to fill out a form .  there &apos;s a pad right around here . 
hi ,  brad . 
is everything okay at work ? 
do you want to take a quick swim ? 
it &apos;s definitely your mama . 
it &apos;s never too soon !  girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes . 
did you go home and get it ? 
first he &apos;s gonna shit .  and then he &apos;s gonna kill us . 
there .  .  .  there &apos;s his car .  i know he &apos;s at work tonight .  he hasn &apos;t come into swenson &apos;s since he called my house .  my mother told him i was still at high school ,  after i told him i was nineteen .  i guess i should tell him i &apos;m fifteen . 
stacy !  i &apos;ve got water in my ears .  do you have any q - tips ? 
you have been acting very strange the last few weeks . 
can i come in ? 
what &apos;s your other question ? 
oh ,  and could i get a quart of wild turkey ,  two fifths of baccardi ,  and a night &apos;s worth of ice delivered to my room ,  please ? 
naked !  ? 
what the fuck are we doing out here ?  somebody call the police !  we need help ! 
not me .  it would blast you through the wall  -  -  stone dead in ten seconds and they &apos;d make me explain it ! 
no !  i felt sorry for the girl ,  i wanted to help her ! 
what &apos;s wrong with you ?  hell ,  somebody has to do it . 
go !  go ! 
you weren &apos;t going to tell me ,  were you ?  just pack up and leave ,  is that it ? 
lillian .  .  .  i &apos;m more than willing to meet you halfway . 
just one minute .  .  . 
well ?  what &apos;d you think ? 
shit .  i meant the other way around . 
why are you always leaving me ,  harry ? 
goodbye ,  harry .  it was very good to see you again . 
what happened ?  who &apos;re you ? 
at one .  promise ? 
i am as he made me .  in his own image . 
are you all right ? 
it was misguided and pointless .  is your answer yes ? 
in science ,  the letter of fact is the letter of law .  our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept .  think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect .  someday you may be priests .  .  .  but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse .   any questions ? 
krempe has a way of provoking my temper . 
we are kindred ,  you and i .  men of ambition .  let me tell you all that i have lost in such pursuits .  i pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man . 
it &apos;s just this place .  the storm .  that &apos;s why you &apos;re all upset . 
why don &apos;t we run ?  just run now ? 
this is almost like the one at my uncle &apos;s cabin in maine . 
ow ! 
it &apos;s beautiful .  .  . 
i told you not to buy that hunk of junk ! 
good luck . 
no ,  but i passed by it a couple of times .  it &apos;s out in the middle of nowhere .  it seems like a rowdy place ,  so there wouldn &apos;t be a lot of police .  and it &apos;s open from dusk till dawn .  you said meet you in the morning . 
oh ,  well ,  excuse me all to hell . 
come on ,  gimme some more details .  how &apos;d it happen ?  some fuckin &apos; drunk kill her ?

what do you think mom would say ? 
do you believe me ? 
how about you ,  cutie pie ?  ready for round two ? 
i never said help us ! 
what the fuck was that about ? 
i gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border .  longer we fuck around el paso our lives ain &apos;t worth a shit . 
well ,  let me tell ya something ,  gonna clear your head right up .  we are officially mexicans . 
oh ,  really . 
see me ,  sir ? 
well ,  you &apos;re doin &apos; shit - hot at intel . 
you really came back for more ?   of this ? 
o &apos;neil ? 
all right .   so who stands to gain if jordan flames out in a big way ? 
i take it this file is still open . 
that why you dumped him ? 
i still can &apos;t believe it .  how does a guy go from an anti - nuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission ? 
do you have any idea what &apos;s going on out there ?  the phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city . 
sdece ,  service de documentation exterieure et de contre - espionnage .  agent phillip raymond . 
how did you get all of this stuff into the country ? 
fred &apos;s no good ,  jason .  you &apos;re going to have to kill it
he wants to think !  ? 
that &apos;s it ? 
a hologram .  .  . 
it doesn &apos;t have to be a hologram .  .  .  just a diversion . 
more to the left .  .  .  stay parallel .  .  . 
how does the rolling help ,  actually ? 
is it a bomb ?   a booby trap ?   tell me ! 
he has a very powerful ship .  perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of - 
as soon as the men have good shelters i &apos;ll move .   perhaps martha will join me this winter . 
yessir . 
however ,  through my relations with members of his majesty &apos;s court ,  i am a representative of the french government whose deepest desire is to be one people ,  united with our american brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of king george of england .   vive la france !   vive l &apos;amerique ! 
no ,  please; an advance on your salary . 
hell ,  why not just shoot her ?  why not shoot everybody .  fuckin &apos; shoot me .  shoot the fuckin &apos; president ? 
i think i pulled my quadriceps . 
c - 18 .

tell you what ,  i &apos;ll stop by harry &apos;s office and pick up a copy for you . 
karen !  what the fuck are you doing ?  ! 
the three hundred large .  what other money is there ?   i should keep quiet ,  i know ,  till i &apos;ve read the script ,  but i &apos;ve got a feeling about this one .  i &apos;m that shylock . 
north island ,  please repeat ?  over . 
seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds ,  it ain &apos;t gonna be what you &apos;d call easy .   any questions ? 
well ,  they &apos;re gonna be asking a lot of questions .  about us .  about those bodies .  about the gold .  seems like we oughta be prepared is all . 
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass . 
what ,  like some kind of ghost ? 
so what ?  we gonna unload the gold and get a move on ? 
i .  .  . 
well lose it !  and why aren &apos;t you pushing the large sizes ?  didn &apos;t you get training about upsizing ? 
no . 
oh my god ,  look !  is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh ? 
you can have that one . 
what &apos;s going on now ?  what &apos;s he doing ? 
he should totally just kill himself .  .  .  hey ,  here &apos;s one   .  .  . oh wait .  .  .   you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats .  .  . 
let &apos;s get out of here ,  this place makes me sick . 
why ?  what did he say ? 
hello ? 
of course it &apos;s a good idea .  .  .  it &apos;s our plan . 
i &apos;m thinkin &apos; maybe i could let it go .  .  . 
didn &apos;t they tell you ? 
punk rock is over ! 
well ,  if it isn &apos;t enid and rebecca ,  the little jewish girl and her aryan friend . 
every guy has a type ! 
wait a minute !  hang on !  jesus ,  i gotta think of something to talk to her about .  no !  no .  .  . 
that didn &apos;t sound like a joke to me .  .  .  what ,  did you write a personal ad or something ? 
there is no reason for fear . 
it &apos;s what the natives are calling the lions -    - two lions have been causing trouble - 
very good indeed . 
we all have our reasons .  mine is simply to make them understand happiness ,  accept salvation ,  know the serenity that comes -    - best i stop .  one of the by - products of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring .  but i know god smiles on me . 
i don &apos;t suppose i could watch . 
we should construct thorn fences around every tent area .  fires burning at night . 
three years i &apos;ve worked for the railroad .  now i don &apos;t know why .  it seemed a good idea once . 
what are you working on ,  egon ? 
frank ,  do you think you could give me a hand with these bags ? 
hello ,  peter . 
what is it ,  honey ? 
who are you going to call ? 
this is the one that looked at dana . 
i ,  vigo ,  the scourge of carpathia  -  - 
 &quot; vigo the carpathian ,  born 1505 ,  died 1610  -  -  &quot; 
and now you &apos;re going to eat it ?

oh ,  no ,  i feel great .   i just ordered some more vitamins .   i see you were exercising .  so was i .   i taped  &quot; 20 minute workout &quot;  and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and i got a really good workout .  you wanna have a mineral water with me ? 
on a purely scientific basis . 
can &apos;t you tell me now ? 
you &apos;re very handy ,  i can tell .   i bet you like to read a lot ,  too . 
i &apos;ll tell you the effect !   it pisses me off ! 
wait !   wait !   let me ask you something .   if you like shot superman with those guns ,  would he feel it or what ? 
generally ,  you don &apos;t see that kind of behavior in a major appliance .   what do you think ,  egon ? 
yes ,  caesar ? 
the emperor and i are bound by the threads of the fates .   he was born on august thirty - first ,  you know . 
they &apos;ll have me .   teach them .   don &apos;t let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history ,  without philosophy ,  without meaning .  teach them of the greeks ,  the babylonians ,  the hebrews ,  the numidians ,  the egyptians and the great romans .   teach them ,  who we are ! 
no  -  -  don &apos;t cry  -  - 
what are you looking for ? 
or this afternoon .  it &apos;s a good day for it . 
where is your luggage ? 
yes ,  i do . 
yes ? 
it is ,  isn &apos;t it ?  it is your first time . 
it &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of  -  - 
then why do you want to talk about it ? 
but i thought you  -  -  i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then . 
well  -  -  i guess i &apos;ll have to ask her out on a date and find out what &apos;s  -  - 
drive down the block . 
i know . 
how long have you and i known each other ?  how long have your dad and i been partners ? 
so i hope you won &apos;t mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice . 
the carlsons &apos; are here . 
no  -  -  no  -  -  no  -  -  no .  .  . 
he must be very nice . 
what ? 
chasing around . 
you must go now .  be careful on your way to your room . 
i &apos;m always alone  -  -  i have been everything . 
if i could trouble the baron to come and see this beautiful room .  i have ordered champagne .  perhaps the baroness could join us . 
you must look at my face and not at the floor . 
you &apos;re a very unusual stenographer  -  - 
what ? 
what brown hands you have . 
since ,  on the eleventh of june of this year  -  -  when the first negotiations for a merger .  .  . 
it &apos;s a very nice room and inexpensive ,  sir . 
he &apos;s a good kid .  a salesman . 
demon !  demon !  that &apos;s why you can walk on it !  demon ! 
well ,  you &apos;ve got your information ahead of new york ,  i see that . 
seven seconds .  i don &apos;t see how you do it . 
mrs .  langtry ,  i &apos;m sorry . 
after the meet .  back to baltimore . 
look at me . 
yeah ? 
you must have some very knowledgeable friends . 
okay ,  then how  &apos;bout we ask you a few questions ? 
don &apos;t think so .   but they sure did a real number on your office .  crap everywhere . 
shit ,  john !   what the hell were you doing out there ?  ! 
i &apos;m going into town .  .  .  run a few errands before dark .   need anything ? 
better her than me . 
what is it this time ? 
christ ,  what a night !   not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road ! 
as always ,  your keen powers of perception astound me .   and you &apos;re right .   i &apos;ve come to celebrate .   after thirty - two years as psychiatric administrator ,  guess who has been named smith &apos;s groves new chief of staff . 
you know what gets me ? 
insurance ! 
what went wrong ? 
big ones ,  little ones ,  teeny - weeny ones -  - just and otherwise . 
the germans shot everybody who lived there ,  then leveled it ,  plowed it ,  planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground .  they wished revenge for the slaying of the beast of yugoslavia .   to their twisted way of thinking ,  your father had butchered an eagle scout .   play lots of contact sports ? 
dad -  - 
i &apos;m a man . 
sir ? 
disease ? 
honeymoon temporarily canceled .   the boy should still go out and exercise .   i have the impression he never gets any exercise .   he simply bloats himself with fig newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators . 
it couldn &apos;t ! 
she &apos;s fine .   please -  - 
this is man to man . 
i &apos;m to be left behind -  - in primordial ooze ? 
no quarter asked .   no quarter given . 
you &apos;re making a mistake .   obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded .   you &apos;ve wounded me . 
can &apos;t do it . 
and you went home unannounced ,  too ? 
mom ? 
that &apos;s why i &apos;m crying . 
we don &apos;t have a maid any more . 
all through the day i &apos;m so confident .   that &apos;s why i &apos;m such a good salesman ,  you know ?   i have confidence ,  and i look like i have confidence ,  and that gives other people confidence .   people laugh sometimes when they find out i &apos;m a vacuum cleaner salesman .   they stop laughing ,  though ,  when they find out i made forty - three thousand dollars last year .   i &apos;ve got six other salesmen working under me ,  and what they all plug into is my confidence .   that &apos;s what charges them up . 
every night ,  penelope ,  for the past two years ,  i &apos;ve made it a point to walk through the park at midnight . 
me ,  too .   i know something not even the police know -  - what &apos;s in the park at midnight .   nothing .   or ,  when i &apos;m in there ,  there &apos;s me in there .  fear and nobody and me . 
or get eaten alive . 
phooey . 
no .  i don &apos;t think so . 
yeah . 
i just want to ask some questions . 
i &apos;m getting angry . 
the other girl is the star ? 
joanne ? 
if we went there ,  would you be able to find him ? 
this is just temporary .  i once made nine hundred in outcall . 
i thought you were going to bed ? 
you don &apos;t want to know .   now ,  wes ,  leave ,  please .  for me . 
where &apos;s ratan ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
maybe .  maybe not . 
you can fuck off ,  too . 
don &apos;t you think we should get some tools ,  maybe ? 
do you play ? 
of your kill  -  ears ,  nose ,  scalp ,  privates . 
were you also the one who painted the statues ? 
get out of the way . 
what the hell was that ?  an ape ? 
every time the media get a look at him ,  they come to me .  i &apos;m running out of lies ,  trevor . 
thank you . 
well the police are going to want to speak to you .  you know that . 
i was bored .  i &apos;d done everything .  i &apos;d gone to the limits .  there was nothing left to experience .  at least nothing i could buy on earth . 
no ,  damn you  -  - 
maybe somebody changed the lock . 
not exactly modern . 
he &apos;s here ? 
larry .  .  . 
public enemy !   all i &apos;m trying to do is cheer us up .   go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care . 
of course i &apos;m not coming .   do i look like i &apos;d want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave ?   where is it ?   the fucking bucktown pub ?   ha ! 
because it &apos;s in the big chill . 
oh really .   well what about the first jesus and mary chain ? 
so shall we leave it at that then ? 
i told you i slept with him . 
you kind of have to start with elvis costello ,  but where ?   &quot; motel matches ?  &quot;   &quot; i want you ?  &quot;   &quot; i hope you &apos;re happy now ?  &quot;   &quot; green shirt ?  &quot;  his records should be sealed in cases that say  &quot; in case of vicious betrayal ,  smash glass .  &quot;   &quot; where did you sleep last night ,  &quot;  sure ,  but by robert johnson or by nirvana ?   maybe a liz phair track .   there are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with .  some devil &apos;s advocate stuff .   the silver jews could be good when you &apos;re ready to start putting it all behind you .  .  .   but i think we &apos;re getting ahead of ourselves there .   ah .   dylan .  bob fucking dylan .   now bob dylan would  -  - the phone rings .   he pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing . 
 .  .  .  like mexico .   or jamaica .   or new york ,  even . 
all i &apos;m saying is ,  you have to allow for things to happen to people ,  most of all to yourself .   otherwise ,  what &apos;s the use ? 
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we weren &apos;t together anymore .   it might even be why i came back . 
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob ,  standing and holding his jacket . 
byzantine ? 
forgers do it all the time .   they take the birth certificate of some -  one who died young and use it to get legit i . d .   usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it . 
you talked to your supervisor lately ?   he &apos;s burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight .   that on top of the cops bugging him . 
eat up dupont .   it will probably be your last . 
all right ,  dear . 
hildy johnson .  .  .  oh ,  hello ,  bruce .  have you got it ?  is it certified ? 
no  -  -  i was just talking to one of the guys at the office .  
i &apos;ll show you what i &apos;m doing .  burns ,  you &apos;re guilty of obstructing justice and so is the morning post .  i &apos;m going to see that the post is fined ten thousand dollars for this . 
what do you mean by that ? 
thanks .  .  . 
i suppose i can &apos;t call this off without creating a scene  -  -  but remember ,  it &apos;s your last fling . 
don &apos;t get technical at a time like this !  do you realize what you &apos;ve done ?  you &apos;ve taken a city that &apos;s been graft - ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you &apos;re kicking  &apos;em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that new york &apos;s having under la guardia !  we &apos;ll make such monkeys out of these ward - heelers next tuesday that nobody &apos;ll vote for them  -  -  not even their wives ! 
bruce is making the nine o &apos;clock train .  i told him you &apos;d be on it  -  -  unless you want to write this story yourself . 
he &apos;s going to have you the rest of his life ,  hildy .  can &apos;t you give me another hour ? 
how about bruce &apos;s ? 
let &apos;s see the money . 
no  -  -  just coffee ,  gus . 
fine work ,  pete !  you certainly delivered the goods .  i &apos;m proud of you . 
take those handcuffs off our friends ,  pete .  that wasn &apos;t at all necessary . 
four hundred and fifty and i &apos;ll cut your throat if you try any tricks ! 
what &apos;s the idea ? 
now ,  listen !  you never arrived here with this  -  -  reprieve .  get it ? 
who ?  hildy johnson ?  she just stepped out .  she &apos;ll be back in a second .  who ?  oh ,  mr .  baldwin .  well ,  if you &apos;ll hang on a minute ,  she ought to be right in .  all right .  
who with ? 
you said that last year ,  dad . 
i want him .  i want him so much .  i &apos;ll kill myself if i can &apos;t have him . 
i think it &apos;s very sensible in the circumstances . 
mac ,  that was wonderful .  i haven &apos;t been to a concert since .  .  . 
the lions were totally covered in this guy &apos;s blood .  .  .  i think they ate his face off ,  tore open his rib cage ,  pulled his legs off .  .  .  it was a wild scene . 
please don &apos;t kill us ,  please don &apos;t kill us . 
aw ,  i was going home to my mamma &apos;s house .  .  .  yeah ,  i was out doing this thing . 
that &apos;s not something to joke about . 
well ,  don &apos;t even think about playing the good samaritan ,  there &apos;s way too many psychos wandering loose these days . 
i hope to christ she doesn &apos;t expect us to wear these things .

after all this time i &apos;d think you &apos;d know me better ,  meyer . 
how do you get from here< / u>  -  to there< / u> ? 
oh ,  here &apos;s something .  the city zoo is kicking off a fund - raising campaign .  they wonder if you &apos;d be willing to appear at a benefit .

ah .  one of the supporting characters . 
did you like the first act ? 
forget it ,  kid .  what &apos;s it *to* you ? 
nothing like -  - uh -  - susan -  - or anything like that ,  huh ? 
of all the times !  of all the times !  two months to the end of his term -  -  and foley has to go and die on us -  - 
what were you saying ,  governor ?  sorry . 
my pigeons -  - i better see about my pigeons . 
uh -  - senator -  - i thought you and me might go out to dinner together -  - and grab off a few monuments . 
it does ! 
well now -  - just to take an example -  -  putting up a dam -  - on willet creek .  as i look at it -  - that dam &apos;s going to do the people of our state a lot of good -  - 
well ,  anyway ,  it &apos;s *something* like that -  -   and it *is* important .  that -  - that steering committee has *got* to see it that way .  and i &apos;m sure senator paine will do all he can -  -   he &apos;s a fine man ,  miss saunders ,  isn &apos;t he ?  he knew my father ,  you know . 
uh -  - willet creek .  it &apos;s just a little stream -  - 
you couldn &apos;t .  you &apos;ve never been out there ,  you said . 
jeff -  - listen -  - remember the day you got here ?  -  - what you said about mr .  lincoln ?  -  - that he was sitting up there -  - watching -  - waiting for someone to come along ?  well -  - that was *you* .  someone with a little plain ,  decent ,  uncompromising *rightness* -  - to root out the taylors -  - yeah ,  and really light up that dome for once .  this country could use some of that -  - so could the whole drunken ,  cockeyed world right now -  - a *lot* of it !  and when the right man comes along -  - no matter *what* the odds -  - he can &apos;t *ever* quit !  a little fellow called david walked out with only a sling -  shot -  - but he had the *truth* on his side -  - 
a camp !  well ! 
the chair recognizes the rather strong -  lunged junior senator ,  mr .  smith . 
uh -  - mr .  president -  - you and i are about to be alone in here ,  sir .  i &apos;m not complaining for social reasons ,  but it &apos;d be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this .   mr .  president -  - i call the chair &apos;s attention to rule five of the standing rules of the senate section three .   &quot; if it shall be found that a quorum is not present ,  a majority of the senators present -  -  ,  &quot;  and that begins to look like me -  -  &quot; may direct the sergeant - at - arms to request ,  and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent senators .  &quot;   mr .  president -  - *i so direct* . 
that &apos;s right .

and you can &apos;t count horst buckholtz anyway .

there &apos;s a big difference . 
here you go .  
we may be getting in over our heads here . 
i hope you will forgive me ,  your majesty ,  for requesting an audience at such a late hour ,  but i have traveled all the way from moscow to see you ,  on a matter which cannot wait . 
if he withdraws his army in good order ,  it will be a serious political defeat .   but ,  if he should be caught on the move ,  with his army ,  in the full grip of winter ,  then it will be a catastrophe .   if your majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence ,  be deceit ,  by any means ,  for another month ,  thus postponing his departure ,  then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of russia . 
ah ,  my dear friend ,  come in ,  come in .   please sit down . 
there are none here . 
ah - hh ,  no . 
will alexander be joining us soon ? 
i hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this ,  madame de beauharnais .   i called to bring this to your son ,  but i understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon . 
oh .  .  .  how very nice of you to bring that for eugene .  .  .  did general de beauharnais give it to you ?

what the hell is the matter with you ? 
you mean you heard them making love ? 
oh ,  no ,  i am very happy .   but you must have patience with me .  .  .  i know nothing at all of what a wife must know .   and i know nothing about men .  my papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender .

all right .  kisses to you . 
yeah ,  now listen .   i can &apos;t mess with these shoes any more or it &apos;s gonna look funny .  you go down get yourself something to drink .  make sure godzilla there ,  follows you . 
just giving you the gift of a clean windshield .  only cost you a dollar . 
fuckin &apos; a .

heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them ! 
not to worry .  no signs of pathology in nancy &apos;s eeg or pulse rate .  i &apos;d guess what we &apos;ve got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell . 
that &apos;ll be exactly half past midnight .  time for me to fall asleep and find him . 
get into bed . 
it was very silly .  .  .  .  i would be ashamed to wear it here . 
are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades ?  and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath ? 
may i ask how much your rooms are ? 
i am ,  gaston . 
and if we have to go to siberia .  .  . 
what kind of a girl are you ,  anyway ? 
leon ,  i would like to ask you something .

it &apos;s dead . 
come ,  sweetheart .  let me put it on you .  you will teach these jewels .  for the first time they will learn how they can look . 
the same old trouble ,  leon .  you &apos;re always late .  whether you &apos;re taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop ,  you &apos;re never on time .  and now ,  when it &apos;s a question of your reform  -  -  late again .   by about five minutes . 
where are they ? 
no ,  i just wanted to be absolutely impartial .  both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years .  we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition .  ninotchka now realizes what she is after . 
good morning ,  comrade . 
you mean you have finished the whole investigation ? 
i am sorry ,  i don &apos;t want to overstep my position  -  -  but please .  .  .  don &apos;t send me . 
i think this is the first time you have been to my little place .  your face is new to me .  now ,  what shall it be ? 
sure ,  they did stuff ,  but nothing like this ,  bob .   forget watergate ,  the break - ins ,  the enemies list .   you got an attempted firebombing at the brookings institution ,  planting mcgovern stuff on the guy that shot wallace ,  trying to slip lsd to jack anderson . 
may i say something ,  mr .  president ? 
who ? 
that was civil war . 
i had nothing to do with that .   was he  .  .  .  in the ellsberg thing ? 
we &apos;ve got to turn off the fbi .   you just go to the cia ,  bob ,  and tell helms that howard hunt is blackmailing the president .   tell him that hunt and his cuban friends know too damn much ,  and if he goes public ,  it would be a fiasco for the cia .   he &apos;ll know what i &apos;m talking about . 
i don &apos;t understand .   track 2 &apos;s chile ? 
if they didn &apos;t tell kennedy about track 2 ,  how did hoover find out ? 
sir ? 
you played it perfectly ,  sir  -  -  cocksucker !   he &apos;s going to think twice before he leaks again . 
we haven &apos;t said grace yet .   richard . 
it looks like to me we &apos;re gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and ,  dick ,  goddamn it ,  you &apos;re going along with it ,  buying into this kissinger bullshit  -  -   &quot; detente &quot;  with the communists .    &quot; detente &quot;   -  -  it sounds like two fags dancing . 
that &apos;s triangular diplomacy ,  gentlemen . 
this will get me a second term .   damn it ,  without risk ,  there &apos;s no heroism .  there &apos;s no history .   i ,  nixon ,  was born to do this . 
secret ,  mr .  chairman ? 
it was illegal ,  what he did . 
what &apos;s in there ? 
dick ,  you should call bobby . 
hiding what ? 
howya doin &apos; !   new york treating you okay ?   i &apos;m sorry i haven &apos;t been able to see you at all -  - 
don &apos;t know why i did .  i told you ,  i don &apos;t know where he is . 
who &apos;s he in trouble with then ? 
yessir ,  his vehicle .  man killed lamar &apos;s deputy ,  took his car ,  killed someone on the highway ,  swapped for his car ,  and now here it is and he &apos;s swapped again for god knows what . 
 .  .  . now that &apos;s aggravating . 
not like that .  not like you say . 
what &apos;s in the satchel ? 
llewelyn . 
where does he work ? 
all right . 
not that way . 
no no .  no .  you don &apos;t understand .  you can &apos;t make a deal with him .  even if you gave him the money he &apos;d still kill you .  he &apos;s a peculiar man .  you could even say that he has principles .  principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that .  he &apos;s not like you .  he &apos;s not even like me . 
no .  .  .  friends from the diner maybe ? 
oh ,  you &apos;re sharp as a tack ,  elden . 
why do i need to see this ?  did he ask you to .  .  .  ? 
elden ,  let me out of here .  now !  this is ridiculous ,  i need medical attention ! 
that &apos;s a lie !  i figured it out !  i &apos;ve been trying to tell this dumbass  -  - 
 .  .  . i s &apos;pose you did that so i could take my sweater off or something . 
i wrote that when i was twelve .  .  .  where &apos;d you get that ?  ! 
you &apos;re sorry ?  you &apos;re the reason we &apos;re here ! 
well ,  i certainly would have heard about that . 
i just want everything to be perfect between us . 
i &apos;ve never met anyone like you ,  betty . 
that &apos;s right .  so ,  if you know it ,  why are you in trouble ? 
where you headed ,  betty ? 
the five ? 
you know ,  the more i think about it ,  this really isn &apos;t david &apos;s kind of place . 
it may not have been an accident .  they never did find her head .  .  . 
don &apos;t worry ,  i &apos;m looking .  .  .  just taking a tiny break . 
yeah ,  but your running away isn &apos;t going to help you with all this .  .  . 
even if he &apos;s falling asleep on his feet ? 
more than you know .  is there anything else ? 
you need to remember who you &apos;re talking to .  .  . 
what &apos;d you get her ? 
right ,  uhh .  .  .  i feel terrible about this ,  we have a prior engagement at another party .   but .  .  .  i &apos;d be honored if you &apos;d come . 
this story is beyond belief ,  which is perfect for us .  it &apos;s free advertising and it &apos;s gonna run for months . 
why would i give a shit how you feel .  and i got news for you .  i loved your  &apos;icy water &apos; idea the other day .  .  .  i &apos;m toying with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident . 
damn ,  that &apos;s sweet .  .  .   she really that good - looking in person ? 
them straw polls is ugly . 
i can and i am and i will  -  tomorrow !  i gotta think about the little wharvey gals !  they look to me for answers !  vernon can s &apos;port  &apos;em and buy  &apos;em lessons on the clarinet !  the only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train ! 
i said i thought it was in the rolltop desk . 
oh i remember  &apos;em ,  colored fellas i believe ,  swell bunch a boys ,  sung into yon can and skedaddled . 
i thought you quit school .  last i heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in brazil .

i say we drink the wine ,  shoot the dogs ,  and use the papers for musket wadding .

victim my ass !   you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage !   maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved ! 
daniel ,  just forget argon .   let &apos;s get out of here .   we &apos;ll find another way to stop the waste .

mrs .   -  -  thorwald &apos;s  -  -  clothes .   -  -  clean  -  -  carefully packed  -  -  not too stylish  -  -  but presentable . 
now don &apos;t get me mad !  even a detective can &apos;t walk in anybody &apos;s apartment and search it .  if i were ever caught in there ,  i &apos;d lose my badge inside of ten minutes ! 
you know ,  every day for three years i asked myself that same question ? 
just don &apos;t dally .  thorwald knows he &apos;s being watched .  he won &apos;t hang around long . 
for what ? 
the only honest thing to do is call it off .  let her look for somebody else . 
what &apos;ll you do if one of them catches you ? 
goodbye ,  mr .  jefferies .  i &apos;ll see you tomorrow . 
what about the rest ? 
the lisa fremont who never wears the same dress twice ? 
sitting around ,  looking out a window to kill time ,  is one thing  -  -  but doing it the way you are  -  -    -  -  with ,  with binoculars ,  and with wild opinions about every little movement you see  -  -  is ,  is diseased ! 
basic equipment .  you don &apos;t leave it behind in your husband &apos;s drawer in your favorite handbag . 
that mrs .  thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband ? 
do you think this was worth waiting all day to see ? 
chelsea 2 - 5598 . 
buzzie -  - we better get out of here .

you thought i was mom ? 
blood . 
i don &apos;t think so -  - 
no ! 
he &apos;s a wheel .   so &apos;s she .   it &apos;s hard to make friends with them . 
i &apos;m here . 
when i was here ?   when i ran away .  i used to run away a lot but they always took me back . 
you want to give me your gun now ,  plato ? 
i shot at one of them . 
if he could -  - 
he makes you feel pretty unhappy ? 
is that why you were wandering around at one o &apos;clock in the morning ? 
all the guys i &apos;ve ever been with .  .  .  they never want to know me .  who i am on the inside .  they just want to qet inside .  when they do ,  they think that means they know who i am .  that i trust them .  that they know me .  that there &apos;s nothing left to learn .   a guy like you ,  nick  -  -  six months before you can even touch my face .  i figure a guy in that kind of bind ,  he &apos;s gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way . 
that guy knows you ? 
he did love you ,  you know .  nick .  he did love you . 
so what the hell good are you .  .  . 
trust me .  they won &apos;t recognize me . 
the powwow safe where you steal your money !  where you cheat your indians ! 
monsters in the gelatin .  .  .

that i should &apos;ve picked you up ? 
let me tell you guys a story .  in one of daddy &apos;s clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named elois . 
what ? 
wong ? 
two minutes ,  tops .  it &apos;s a tough two minutes .  it &apos;s daylight ,  during business hours ,  dealing with a crowd .  but you &apos;ll have the guys to deal with the crowd . 
uhuh ,  uhuh ,  what &apos;s i tell ya ?  that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho . 
tagged a couple of cops .  did you kill anybody ? 
i got the diamonds . 
so what is it ? 
you don &apos;t know how good it is to see you . 
steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire . 
all my clothes  -  - 
like why you &apos;re buyin &apos; a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden . 
do you have to be so close - mouthed ?  i &apos;m your brother .  and i &apos;m ridin &apos; with you .  remember ? 
why ? 
it is so your fault and .  .  .  and i guess maybe when we hit the ranch .  .  .  you andme better .  .  . 
runnin &apos; off and worryin &apos; people .  makin &apos; it tougher on clay than it is already . 
what is it ? 
hey ,  look ,  i &apos;m wilma flintstone . 
hey ,  you left your book back there . 
i meant you &apos;re into ghosts . 
oh yeah .  .  .  another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy .  more feminine .  and her tits are perfect .  not pointy and funny looking ,  or spaced too far apart .  .  . 
yes ,  we made it ! 
i got it ! 
i wouldn &apos;t give ya a nickel . 
hi !

you bring me such peace .  .  . 
who &apos;s voice was it ,  dottie ?

carl padgett died for the franklin mint ,  didn &apos;t he ?  ! 
oooohh !  a fruit cake .  thank you ,  mrs .  sutphin .  have a seat . 
i &apos;ll take this instead . 
he loves you ,  mary ,  and you &apos;ll have to tell him . 
why can &apos;t everyone be happy like we are  -  -  laugh and have good times .  look at that poor little one  so sad because she can &apos;t find her sister .  and that man with her  -  he doesn &apos;t make her laugh  he just sits and talks . 
tell me where jacqueline is  -  we &apos;ve got to find her . 
perhaps . 
it is a very real danger and one which forces our decision . 
do you have other things ? 
graham is an unusual name . 
well .  .  . 
i know that i just don &apos;t feel a connection with very many people ,  so i don &apos;t waste time with people i don &apos;t feel one with . 
i can &apos;t . 
all right ,  you want to talk about lies ,  let &apos;s talk about lies ,  ann .  let &apos;s talk about lying to yourself .  you haven &apos;t been able to sleep with your husband because you &apos;re no longer in love with him ,  and maybe you never were .  you haven &apos;t been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember . 
john ? 
i have thought about it ,  yes . 
when did you begin having this feeling ? 
ann ,  in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas .   did it occur to you that graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy ? 
you understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time ? 
that you are under no obligation to me ? 
i say it because it &apos;s descriptive . 
what !  ? 
no .  i don &apos;t think they all did what i did . 
i don &apos;t understand .  why did you want to come here ?  i mean ,  i can &apos;t imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me . 
may i ask who &apos;s calling ? 
mr .  millaney ? 
oh ,  you feel very good ,  betts .  you have such a cosy body .  i &apos;m jealous ,  i &apos;m so skinny . 
you &apos;re the one who found the bodies ? 
a free thinker . 
a  &apos;stately pleasure home &apos; indeed . 
but they only think they &apos;re happy . 
but without you and me ,  sis  the world &apos;d fall to pieces  vena cava who &apos;s the raver ? 
so what &apos;d you guys finally decide on for the menu ? 
yes they are .  and i &apos;m serious .  do not fuck with me .  i am going to get laid before i settle down on saturday .  do you read me ? 
what do you think ? 
and if they want to drink merlot ,  we &apos;re drinking merlot . 
tastes like the back of a fucking la schoolbus .  probably didn &apos;t de - stem ,  hoping for some semblance of concentration ,  crushed it up with leaves and mice ,  wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit .  fucking raid . 
so what &apos;s the plan ? 
hey ,  miles .  good to see you . 
she got anything good ? 
universally rejected .  strike three . 
it &apos;s probably picking up another baby monitor . 
jake ,  i &apos;m going to ask you once  -  -  was it self - defense ? 
gotta go . 
i &apos;ve got my people sitting down there .  .  .    .  .  . swatting flies and raring to go . 
jefferson city ? 
that &apos;s the longest i ever did it .   &apos;bout bust a gut . 
hello ,  cobb . 
i &apos;ve given that up . 
i told you this was a sweet set - up . 
i thought we talked about that . 
i &apos;d love to stop somewhere but i &apos;m late .   i &apos;m on my way to see viktor now . 
i want to reassure you ,  elaine ,  there &apos;s absolutely nothing going on between viktor and i . 
my god ,  are you alright ,  simone ? 
thanks .   this is my exit so ,  i  -  - 
i don &apos;t have it on me .   anyway ,  it means a lot .   have you read the reviews ?   they &apos;re love letters .   listen to this one .    &quot; simone has the voice of a young jane fonda ,  the body of sophia loren ,  the grace of ,  well ,  grace kelley ,  and the face of audrey hepburn combined with an angel &quot;  . 
i can &apos;t wait to meet her . 
well ,  yes .   from a studio point of view ,  it would be better if simone stayed single .   anyhow ,  i thought she came across great tonight .   intelligent ,  well informed ,  a natural .   and touching .  she was spectacular . 
don &apos;t look so glum ,  viktor .   it &apos;s not a death sentence . 
mom ,  do you miss dad ? 
what i do to simone ? 
hi ,  dad . 
hey ,  lainey .   how &apos;s your love life ? 
i know but mom doesn &apos;t .   maybe if it came from simone ,  if simone spoke to mom  -  -  she could straighten things out .   dinner ,  maybe . 
don &apos;t you have a real story to write ?   why aren &apos;t you in latin america ? 
wow .  they called you their son . 
what was that you were saying before with your soldiers ?  day pro fun . 
i think we said everything we needed to say .   maybe it &apos;s time to say things to someone else ?  someone close to you ? 
they &apos;re right here . 
she says she &apos;s sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant .  she just likes it a lot . 
listen to me ,  you banjo - dueling ,  country ass hayseed .  .  .  i want my nikes and i want them now !

no  -  - 
how about brenda ? 
please ,  starla .  i &apos;m gonna do my best not to hurt anybody  -  - 
guess it &apos;s hard to explain how amazin &apos; a human brain is to someone who that &apos;s all they know . 
grant ,  no  -  -  i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m just  -  -  i &apos;m not in the mood .  grant is on top of her ,  breathing a little too heavy .  grant come on ,  baby ,  it &apos;s  -  -

bulllllshit .  .  . 
what i &apos;m saying is :  don &apos;t trust anyone .   find yourself a weapon of some sort . 
is it a planet ? 
thinking what you were doing and saying ,  just being consumed by thinking of you .   i loved it so much ,  that feeling .

this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory . 
now we expand our search to include uniforms . 
thank you ,  captain . 
your research laboratory is most impressive .  .  .

with a full head of hair . 
the extraterrestrial now looks like this . 
i don &apos;t care where you &apos;re from you just can &apos;t disappear into thin air . 
maybe .  .  .  look ,  this is just something to think about .  .  .  from what i got at the shopping center ,  it was more scared than anything else .  .  .  i don &apos;t feel it &apos;s as big a threat as you think it is .  .  .

you were supposed to go downstairs ,  baby . 
you have to get out of here .   if tran catches you he &apos;ll .  .  .  he &apos;s acting crazy .   he &apos;s doing way too much playback and he &apos;s getting completely paranoid .   he &apos;s such a control freak ,  he &apos;s even paying max to follow me around .

he thinks he looks young . 
mack ,  i &apos;m sorry .  i apologize .  i should have called .  i had no right to sneak in on you like that . 
there &apos;s the agency issue .  i think koessler may suspect something already .  we &apos;re not on the best footing with him as it is . 
it &apos;s quite advanced . 
it &apos;s my master list of missing persons :  men ,  boys ,  girls ,  children over the last ten years .  two hundred and eighty - five names .  a pool of possible victims .

two terms; one in italy ,  one in the united states .   he &apos;s known to the government as a top narcotics man .  that could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify .

mr .  chairman .  .  .  there &apos;s .  .  .  another amendment .  .  .  that i &apos;d like to invoke at this time ,  but it &apos;s not the fifth amendment .   i wonder if you &apos;re familiar with it .

i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn &apos;t even know who his own kid is .   what right did then have to show up here ? 
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind .

where are you ? 
something happened to you . 
you know ,  this is crazy . 
what &apos;s this ? 
we were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work .   we had over seven thousand feet of hole down for chrissake .   i can &apos;t believe you let them grab my rig ! 
no ,  i think you were .   come on ,  admit it .

i feel as if i &apos;ve eaten glass . 
she &apos;d seen him too . 
thanks .  
you can call me sister . 
because she &apos;s an innocent .  she &apos;s a slate that &apos;s hasn &apos;t been touched except by god . 
oh come on ,  you &apos;ve talked to her .  she doesn &apos;t even know how babies are born ,  let alone made . 
i haven &apos;t decided yet . 
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet .   and of course 
even christ would partake socially . 
a miracle is an event without an explanation .  if she &apos;s capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail ,  why couldn &apos;t she split a cell in her womb ? 
somebody told her . 
that &apos;s enough . 
get him out of here !  ! 
oh aye ,  a sledge . 
of course  .  .  .  look ,  if she was a liverpool scrubber  .  .  .   eh ,  fella ,  you want to try pulling the other one ,  it &apos;s got a full set of bells hanging off it  .  .  .  y &apos;what ?   .  .  .  i know your sort ,  two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it &apos;s love and we &apos;re stopping in an empty shop doorway .  you &apos;re just after me body and y &apos;can &apos;t have it  .  .  .  so there !  ! 
will you ever look at him ,  sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book ! 
you ugly ,  great brute you ,  you have sadism stamped all over your bloated british kisser . 
eh ,  he &apos;s a nice old man ,  isn &apos;t he ? 
mind you ,  i stood up for you ,  i mean i wouldn &apos;t have it . 
eh ,  what &apos;s all this ? 
except it will take 75 years to get a reply back .   don &apos;t forget how far we are from the colonies ,  martin . 
close enough to walk to ! 
okay ,  i &apos;m in the mouth of the chimney now ,  and i &apos;m starting down . 
hello ,  faust ! 
it &apos;s a crude symbolic language  -  -  looks primitive . 
we can &apos;t pump poison gas down into the cooling unit !   it &apos;ll flood the whole ship ! 
we &apos;d better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there .  
isn &apos;t  &quot; bait &quot;  the word you used ? 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
doesn &apos;t seem much doubt about it ,  does there ? 
i understand why you did that . 
look at these suckers  -  -  no wonder we couldn &apos;t get it off him . 
can i .  .  .  um .  .  .  have some water ?   please ? 
auto - shop &apos;s sealed ,  but those boys are cut - off . 
wait .   lost it . 
is it still moving ? 
move it baby ,  or they &apos;re gonna be chewin &apos; on my cojones ! 
phoebe ? 
i think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility .  it is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly .  .  . 
look closely ,  eve ,  it &apos;s time you did .  i am addison dewitt .  i &apos;m nobody &apos;s fool .  least of all  -  yours . 
i &apos;m giving her a very high - class party .  it ain &apos;t like a rehearsal ,  she don &apos;t have to be late . 
she was magnificent . 
miss caswell got lucky too late .  the audition is over . 
no heart to burn . 
and you ,  i take it ,  are the paderewski who plays his concerto on me ,  the piano ?   where is princess fire - and - music ? 
thanks for your help .  .  .  good luck . 
he &apos;ll agree with you .  tell me ,  what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out ?  just huddle in that doorway and wait ? 
do you want it on ? 
who is it ?  what &apos;s it all about ? 
 -  - it was fine the way it was -  - 
 -  - no way -  - 
listen -  - we know you &apos;re involved in this -  - we &apos;re going to get the story ,  why not help ? 
you &apos;ve really got to go . 
no games ,  irwin; give . 
try and understand this .  i &apos;m a decent republican .  i believe in richard nixon .  i worked in the white house four years -  - so did my wife .  what happened on june 17 i don &apos;t think the president knew anything about .  some of his men i &apos;m not so sure of . 
are you implying you don &apos;t believe me ? 
as usual ,  that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly .   except  it wasn &apos;t local democratic headquarters ,  it was national democratic headquarters -  -    -  - and  these weren &apos;t just any idiots ,  these were special idiots ,  seeing as when they were arrested at 2 : 30 this morning ,  they were all wearing business suits and playtex gloves and were carrying -  -    -  - a walkie - talkie ,  forty rolls of film ,  cameras ,  lock picks ,  pen - sized tear gas guns ,  plus various bugging devices .   not to mention over two thousand dollars ,  mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills . 
 .  .  . go on ,  go on .  .  . 
mr .  sloan ? 
what the hell was that ? 
what &apos;s your middle name ? 
well ,  state &apos;s got a good business school .   and i can probably walk onto the lacrosse team .   green peppers ? 
i &apos;ll give you a hint .    &quot; ohhh ,  yeah ,  yeah !  &quot;   comprende ? 
what the heck is this ? 
can i come in ? 
dad !  ! 
you can do that ? 
i was being selfish .   and majorly insensitive .   and i &apos;m a total idiot .

i know .  well ,  alvy ,  it &apos;ll pass ,  it &apos;ll pass ,  it &apos;s just that i &apos;m going through a phase ,  that &apos;s all . 
if they &apos;re only babies ,  then you pick  &apos;em up .

it &apos;s my first time . 
how -  i don &apos;t want you to live with me ?  how -  whose idea was it ?

we have to find the dog ,  ryan . 
jesus christ ,  it &apos;s a fucking dog ! 
ryan !

i trust you . 
you don &apos;t have kids to keep a marriage together ,  sally .   it &apos;s only five months since joe came back .

out here i &apos;m just what ? 
why do they have you tied up here ? 
barbatus ! 
we know what makes an ant colony strong ,  don &apos;t we ?   we know that no ant can be an individual .   no single< / u> ant matters ,  right ? 
well i ,  i don &apos;t think  &quot; living it up &quot;  is the right term  -  -  how about  &quot; working themselves to death &quot;  ? 
who ? 
oh .  did you find something here  -  -  an envelope  -  -   ? 
i just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time .  bud  how many guys were there ?

maybe he &apos;ll get tubed . 
you hear it again ? 
what makes you so sure my boys won &apos;t be waiting for us ? 
212  continued : 
i still can &apos;t believe i &apos;m being financed by an oil company .  especially when they get a look at these pictures .   technology in the wilderness; not too pretty .   what &apos;s that ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
technology in the wilderness .  only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip . 
we get wet ,  we freeze to death in a couple hours . 
emergency transmitter ?   all your gear is back at wilder &apos;s . 
it was blown up with the plane . 
you don &apos;t mind me saying ,  mr .  desmond ,  you look like hell . 
it &apos;s amazing these things weren &apos;t done . 
okay . 
and mean it .  .  . 
i &apos;ll never forget you said it . 
i &apos;ll take you .  .  .  why not ? 
so ,  what &apos;s new anyway ?  how &apos;s verdell ? 
what ? 
i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you . 
it looks like white &apos;s game . 
no ,  they didn &apos;t . 
i think i got one today . 
your a good guy chris you deserve a nice girl . 
good news comrades ,  it &apos;s better than we &apos;d hoped .  lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it &apos;s a piece of cake . 
i &apos;m making history chris ,  nothings going to stop me .  there could be a knighthood for us in this ,  once president havel hears . 
you get the wine and i &apos;ll go see if i can rustle up some plastic cups . 
it &apos;s not fair ,  you hardly talked to me tonight . 
if you get out can we be together again . 
it &apos;s all my fault ,  i &apos;m so sorry doug . 
weren &apos;t you going to get some glasses ? 
your father dropped off an extra check . 
after he moved out ,  i invited him to every practice ,  every game ,  every parent - teacher conference you ever had .  he didn &apos;t show ,  not once . 
what are you doing here ? 
everything &apos;s being done but it &apos;s not enough .  i have to find something  -  -  more . 
 &apos;i hope your dreams come true .  &apos;
yeah .   i &apos;m probably not going to be around next time it comes . 
you were great the other night . 
people can see . 
what does that mean ?  ! 
whatever you need .  whatever jamie needs .  i &apos;m here .   i could start by driving her to school  -  - 
when mom died you told me god wanted her more ,  loved her more  -  - 
materially or spiritually ? 
finally ,  i &apos;d like you to join the drama club .  rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings . 
no way .  no thanks .  i can &apos;t do it  -  - 
uh ,  hi ,  eileen . 
but professor  -  - 
hop in ,  marty ,   .  we &apos;ve got a long drive ahead of us . 
now who &apos;s being stupid ?  the guy who runs this place . 
suzy ! 
what you been doing ? 
hi . 
 &quot; the kon - tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions .  we had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs .  i thought at once of suction from the coast ,  which was drawing near ,  and was continually out on the deck and up the mast .  .  .  &quot; 
yes . 
everybody ready ?   how do we look ?   do we look okay ? 
raise your hand .  .  . where ? 
he offered you money ? 
go away .   let me rot ? 
what &apos;s his problem ? 
look ,  maybe it &apos;s none of my business ,  but a man with your talent  don &apos;t you think your first obligation would be to your gift ?  shouldn &apos;t you be doing whatever you have to do to work again ? 
 .  .  . look ,  you &apos;re confused ?  you need guidance ?  talk to another writer . 
what do you mean ,  barton ? 
and what &apos;s your line ,  mr .  meadows ? 
but charlie  why me ?  why 
 .  .  . where did we put him ? 
doctor .  ear ,  nose and throat man ,  . 
how long were you having sex with him ? 
but you said you liked men to use their hands . 
how exactly did you hear ? 
aren &apos;t you going to thank me ? 
maybe she saw something she didn &apos;t see before . 
what kind of talk ? 
forgive me for askin &apos; ,  son ,  and i don &apos;t mean to belabor the obvious ,  but why is it that you &apos;ve got your head so far up your own ass ? 
you feeling better ? 
you &apos;re asking me this because of the  &apos;lapdog &apos; remark .  i read that .  the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly .  that &apos;s your enemy ,  not your audience .  your audience hasn &apos;t even been born yet .  it &apos;s a lie that art is popular .  the only thing popular about it is that it &apos;s written about in newspapers .  i &apos;m surprised when anybody comes to my openings .  there &apos;re about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting ,  and andy &apos;s one of them . 
everybody &apos;s paying top dollar for scraps of paper ,  refrigerator doors  anything with a samo tag on it .   the other day ,  i just wanted a pack of cigarettes ,  so i did a drawing and sold it for two bucks .  a week later this gallery calls me up :   &quot; somebody &apos;s offering us the drawing .  should we buy it for five thousand ?  &quot; 
what &apos;s that ? 
didn &apos;t i say that ? 
ingenious costume .   let me guess  .  .  .  trust - fund goody - goody ? 
alfred ,  are you .  .  .  ? 
this is easy . 
after you have frozen ,  your icy tomb will plummet back to gotham .

that &apos;s all right .   we have no secrets from our readers .   mr .  thatcher is one of our most devoted readers ,  mr .  bernstein .   he knows what &apos;s wrong with every issue since i &apos;ve taken charge .  what &apos;s the cable ? 
i might make him nervous . 
maybe that was something he lost .  mr .  kane was a man that lost  -  almost everything he had  -   you ought to talk to bradford leland .  he could tell you a lot .   i wish i could tell you where leland is ,  but i don &apos;t know myself .   he may be out of town somewhere  -  he may be dead . 
we haven &apos;t heard from him . 
i suppose so ,  but  -  i &apos;m not afraid of the story .   you can &apos;t tell me that the voters of this state  - 
get out ,  both of you ! 
if you want to come in and wash your face  -   i can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers  - 
where &apos;s the soap ? 
i &apos;m going to leave you . 
you do anything you want to do .  the people of this state can decide which one of us to trust .   if you want to know ,  they &apos;ve already decided .  the election tuesday &apos;ll be only  - 
get dr .  corey . 
first of all ,  i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the  &quot; enquirer .  &quot; 
you want love on your own terms ,  don &apos;t you ,  charlie  -   love according to your own rules .  and if anything goes wrong and you &apos;re hurt  -  then the game stops ,  and you &apos;ve got to be soothed and nursed ,  no matter what else is happening  -  and no matter who else is hurt ! 
it &apos;s going to be done exactly the way i &apos;ve told mr .  thatcher  - 
i guess maybe i &apos;m not as hard to see through as i think .   anyway ,  i never even answered his letter .  maybe i should have .   i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years .   he hadn &apos;t finished it when she left him  -  he never finished it  -  he never finished anything .   of course ,  he built it for her  - 
who told you you could sit down here ? 
maybe you should take that coffee outside .

the chocolate and cigarettes you brought in  -  you lose that as you are now convicted .  now go over to the table and get undressed .  alex walks to table and undresses .  chief guard moves to table with his clipboard . 
brown hair ,  is it ? 
the next morning i was taken to the ludovico medical facility ,  outside the town centre ,  and i felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old staja ,  as you always will when you leave a place you &apos;ve like gotten used to .  chief guard briskly leads the way for alex and escort .  they move into reception hall where the doctor stands . 
i hope so .  is that the end then ?

 &apos;on july 8 ,  1979 ,  security forces under control of the trilateral commission abducted the fathers of all american nobel prize winners .  the men ,  many of them octogenarians ,  were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles .   the sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the rand corporation in santa monica ,  california .  &apos;
you &apos;re a holden caulfield fan . 
what is it ?

ellie .  .  .  we both know that if i was any kind of a man ,  i never would &apos;ve entered this race .   that i would have told the president straight out :   helen ,  eleanor arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass .  .  .  but she &apos;s got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together .   that more then anyone else on the planet ,  she &apos;s earned this .   and that she should be the one to go because she &apos;s the best we have .   but that &apos;s not who i am .   i like to think it &apos;s who i might &apos;ve been if things had gone a different way; that i might have been worthy ,  really worthy of what i &apos;ve been given .  .  .   you do what you have to do .   and in the end ,  as with everything ,  it comes down to power .   and it isn &apos;t fair .  .  . 
so .   what happens now ? 
peter  -  -  if you can get him to do that for me he &apos;d obviously do the same for you  -  -  we could  -  -   !

mary  -  -  it &apos;s gone . 
ruined  -  -  all the fields  -  -  ruined .  
 &quot; there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job; and that man was perfect and upright ,  and one that feared god and eschewed evil .  &quot;

i mean ,  how could you not play anymore ?  that &apos;s so strange to me .  .  . 
it doesn &apos;t matter .  it was the feeling i was affected by . 
john believes in the basic goodness of man ,  and that &apos;s fine ,  but gaze into the pit like i have and that view seems a little soporific .  and not unlike television ,  it hardly represents the real world .  .  .

would you like to meet him ? 
it &apos;s beautiful . 
of course that doesn &apos;t jibe with what we found .   this was an angry killing . 
what are you waiting for ? 
we found his spit in the dead director &apos;s eye .  he &apos;s signed a confession -  - supplied us with the suit he wore on the night .   what more do you want ? 
it &apos;s about the director .

i understand .   that &apos;s already been taken care of .   now you appreciate i can only work with the raw material i have at my disposal but for a little extra .  .  . i could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability .

fanucci is not connected; he is alone .

whose orders are these ? 
anthony ,  daddy &apos;s busy . 
when he saw his brother in the hearing room ,  he knew what was at stake .   i don &apos;t think vincenzo would have done it .   he loves the kids ,  too .  omerta ,  kay .   honor ,  silence .   it had nothing to do with me .   it was between those brothers . 
however i can help you .  .  . 
you have to be careful what you say in front of the others .  .  .  they frighten easy .   it &apos;s always been that way ,  most men frighten easy . 
if only i could live to see it ,  kid; to be there with you .   how beautifully we &apos;ve done it ,  step by step .   here ,  protected ,  free to make our profits without the justice department ,  the fbi; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government .   ninety miles ,  just a small step ,  looking for a man who desperately wants to be president of the united states ,  and having the cash to make it possible . 
that is why he must go to hell .   i do not think it fair .   but god &apos;s law is not for us to judge . 
i need to talk to you about mr .  whale . 
or would you prefer a beer ? 
everybody has stories to tell . 
oh ,  there may not be atheists in the foxholes ,  but there are occasionally lovers . 
i would &apos;ve thought mr .  leslie howard would be more your line . 
mr .  kay ,  sir . 
who was that at the door ? 
mr .  boone .   he is an interesting friend . 
so ,  mr .  kay ?   what do you want to know ? 
universal wanted me for another story ,  and wanted me so baldly  -  -  i mean badly ,  not baldly .   i was given the pick of stories being developed ,  and i picked that one . 
oh my god .   what &apos;s wrong ,  mr .  whale ?   is it your heart ? 
how &apos;s the leg ? 
i know you . 
i remember .  supper getting cold ,  cos you two are out there heads under hoods  .  .  .

the alarms go off  .  .  . 
i know what you did inside .  you did what you had to do .  i &apos;m not talking about that .   i &apos;m talking from now on ,  outside .  i &apos;m talking right here . 
nobody &apos;s helping me .  tommy got four years .  marty and fran are broke .   i asked your friend remo for the money he owed you ,  and you know what he told me ? 
the guy just sold the property .  they &apos;re gonna build condominiums and i don &apos;t want anybody digging up the little bastard .

it was the first time i had ever seen anyone shot .

how &apos;s the woman ? 
fuck you .  you owe it to me .  tomorrow i &apos;m gonna wake up and i &apos;ll be fifty and i &apos;ll still be doin &apos; this .  and that &apos;s all right  &apos;cause i &apos;m gonna make a run at it .  but you ,  you &apos;re sittin &apos; on a winning lottery ticket and you &apos;re too much of a pussy to cash it in .  and that &apos;s bullshit  &apos;cause i &apos;d do anything to have what you got !  and so would any of these guys .  it &apos;d be a fuckin &apos; insult to us if you &apos;re still here in twenty years . 
see ,  now this doesn &apos;t feel right .   when i made the decision to come over here it felt right .  i had all these rationalizations .  .  .  i just don &apos;t understand why will never tells me anything ,  he won &apos;t let me get close to him ,  he tells me these weird lies -  - 
i don &apos;t care what his family &apos;s like or if he doesn &apos;t have any brothers ,  but he doesn &apos;t have to lie to me . 
alexander ,  i know your theory .  the boy is updating ,  he &apos;s strategy stealing .  .  .

we can &apos;t stay in here ! 
this is single - wall construction !  it &apos;s just a shack ! 
i found a way to re - route through the program .   i &apos;m turning the cars around in the rest area loop . 
the lysine contingency  -  it &apos;s intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island ,  but we could use it now .   dr .  wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism .  animals can &apos;t manufacture the amino acid lysine .   unless they &apos;re continually supplied with lysine by us ,  they &apos;ll go into a coma and die . 
constantly sick .

you &apos;ve been with the firm for nearly nine years .   you &apos;ve done your work diligently ,  there are no complaints on that score .   but there &apos;s more to the job than the work  -  -  there are other people to consider  -  -  and frankly ,  kafka ,  we eel your social situation could bear improving . 
i nominated you as a possible candidate .   you were eduard &apos;s good friend .   he read me some of your work .

this is the number for hospice .  ok .  now .  as far as the morphine pills go ,  there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in ,  there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine .  .  .  . it &apos;s a little bottle ,  with an eye dropper and it &apos;s easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back ,  i mean ,  it will certainly cure his pain ,  but he will float in and out of consciousness ,  even worse than he is now ,  linda .   i mean ,  any sign of the recognizable earl will pretty much go away  -  -

i care only about michelle .   should i ask her when we first arrive ?  or .  .  .  or when we &apos;re leaving ?   i could ask her in the carriage  -  -  but it is more romantic at the palace .  i get so confused .  .  . 
but  -  -  are you sure ? 
the desire for vengeance .  .  .  can be a poison . 
you can cut the shit ,  asshole -  - 
well don &apos;t you think that &apos;s odd ?

no .  it happened when graham went to see hobbs &apos; daughter four months later in the hospital .  she saved her carotid artery .  .  ,  but lost three fingers and her larynx .  she was connected up to a voice box .   when graham went to see her ,  she asked him  -  -  through the speaker :   &apos;why did you have to kill my daddy ?  &apos;  that &apos;s when graham had his nervous breakdown . 
blond ,  right - handed ,  really strong ,  wears a size eleven shoe .  the prints are all smooth gloves .  he &apos;s on a full moon cycle .  both times .  his blood is ab positive . 
he used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way .  when he was watching from the woods .  why didn &apos;t he use it to go through the basement door ? 
when do you need it ? 
i &apos;ll see you later .  all right ? 
who is it ? 
two groups of people were changed .  leeds and jacobi .  the police think they were murdered .   do you know what they call the being that visited these people ?   you can say .

he &apos;s white and six feet tall .  you haven &apos;t told me anything yet . 
which part ?  that or the day - to - day . 
i &apos;m thinking about painting the kitchen .  what color do you like ,  will ?  are you there ? 
how ? 
because ,  my dear will ,  if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon ,  he might go outside and look at it .   have you seen blood in moonlight ,  will ?  it appears quite black .  if one were nude ,  it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing .

bless me ,  father ,  for i have sinned .  it &apos;s been two months since my last confession . 
the breath had almost totally left her body .  she was as white as snow .  and then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house .  the mourners .  and me .  and herself !  she ate a meal that would choke a pig !

you sent for me . 
you &apos;ve got your ten levels ,  right ?  here they are .  .  .   each level has an exit ,  only remember ,  the exits aren &apos;t always what they seem .   first one &apos;s the blood red sky ,  then you &apos;ve got the blue desert ,  tower of ghosts ,  kingdom of the blind .  .  .   on each world you have to find a golden key and you &apos;ve only got so much time to do it in .   if you &apos;re too late ,  the screamer comes . 
so where is he ? 
i don &apos;t want anything to happen to you .   i care about you .

sidney ,  do you have any idea how he could &apos;ve gotten your number ? 
i was afraid they were bait ,  something to ,  ya know ,   trick you out of hiding .

i &apos;m declining this case .   i want us reassigned . 
just ,  honestly .  .  .  have you ever seen anything like this .  .  .  been involved in anything like this ?

it makes us feel a whole lot better . 
interesting . 
it &apos;s ok .  there &apos;s no problem . 
that &apos;s what it cost ,  david . 
but i bet you didn &apos;t say you were going to split on him . 
what guy that died ? 
here ?  . 
i &apos;m thinking of investing with him .  he worries me . 
maybe he &apos;s too flighty and irresponsible .  that &apos;s why i asked if he was a fairy . 
lester ,  you &apos;re a miserable man .  you &apos;re not helping anybody .  you &apos;re just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves  -  -  this is just business ,  don &apos;t kid yourself .  and you know the worst thing about it ,  even if it does somebody some good somewhere which i can &apos;t possibly imagine ,  you &apos;ll never know the difference .  you &apos;re just sweating and kidding yourself  -  and you &apos;re kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl  -  -  or that she &apos;ll keep her hands off him . 
why not ? 
nummers .

yeah ,  it might be . 
yeah ,  give him another one .  and i &apos;ll take a cup of coffee while you &apos;re at it . 
so that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000 ,  doesn &apos;t it ?   if you sent the equity back ,  you had a profit of $2500 . 
you think that is< / u> the truth . 
and yet you started the engine right up .   with all those lights drawing all night ,  the batteries had that much charge .   did that strike you odd ? 
i believe so . 
operating this winch you &apos;d rarely operated before ,  doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds .  .  . is it possible< / u> .   possible that he struck his head after< / u> death .  possible ? 
so if his head struck something narrow and flat ,  the gunnel of a boat ,  a net roller ,  a fairlead ,  could that have .  .  . 
yes ,  sue ?   what is it ?

i got a funny sensation in my toes  -  like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame .

remember when we first spoke to jerry ,  barnes kept asking for jerry &apos;s real name ?   but harry never would ?   he didn &apos;t because he was afraid the screen would say  &quot; harry &quot;  ,  instead of jerry .   we weren &apos;t talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry ,  we were talking to harry .  .  .  or a part of harry . 
damn it !   chloramphenicol ?

are you alright  ? 
how do you feel about him now  ? 
you can &apos;t walk me home . 
you used to dance .  .  .

it &apos;s a huge moment in their life  -  - 
you mean for you .   a 10 - year - old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family .   she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time .  and you think it &apos;s best for her if every -  one pretends it didn &apos;t happen ?   this isn &apos;t going to work out .

if they come down low enough to make a firing pass ,  they &apos;ll never be able to pull up in time . 
sorry ,  king .   my leg &apos;s stiff as a board . 
yep ,  it &apos;s the crm - 114 code ,  all right . 
there are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose . 
that was really great . 
it &apos;s really not about anything . 
mm .  hey ,  what are you doing now ? 
it &apos;s your birthday ? 
hey !  on behalf of burnfield ,  i present to you the keys to the city . 
oh ,  my god ,  you found it .  thank you so much .   did you get your tape ? 
score !  yeah ! 
you &apos;re a drunk and an idiot . 
yeah ! 
you think i &apos;m rich and you hate me . 
 &quot; it &apos;s not a job ,  it &apos;s an adventure .  &quot;  right ?  i hated it .  i had to get out .  so i was working in the kitchen ,  chopping lettuce ,  you know ,  real heroic stuff ,  and i ,  uh ,  i had this big fucking knife and i chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later i was a free man . 
yeah .  yeah ,  no ,  you &apos;re right .  it &apos;s no big deal ,  you know .  guy probably has his arm around her right now ,  holding her close ,  nudging her titty with his elbow ,  talking about the deep significance of his music ,  while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes .  in a few minutes they &apos;ll be back at the four seasons .  you ever ,  you ever stayed in one of those places ? 
you know ,  and what are you doing here in the first place ,  man ?  he &apos;s just gonna call the cops again . 
no ,  no ,  no .  i &apos;m not being cynical ,  i &apos;m being honest . 
i &apos;ve run out of words . 
well ,  shit ,  man ,  you &apos;ve only been gone for a year ,  man ,  is that your limo ? 
pony ,  oh my god ! 
yeah ?  well ,  what &apos;d she say ? 
yeah ? 
another sex dream ? 
oh my g - d ,  i read about this !   it &apos;s called a  &quot; pregnancy insanity .  &quot;   quick ,  she needs a sitz bath  -  - 
what ?  !   that &apos;s insane !  !  !   why would i go to the police ? 
i see a flower .   and y &apos;know ,  even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt . 
yeah ? 
look ,  maybe i can watch a pg movie .  .  .  i &apos;ll just say i &apos;m counting dirty words for sunday school . 
kansas ,  i want you to meet someone special . 
sorry ,  miss schaefer ,  but i &apos;ve given up writing on spec . 
psychopaths sell like hotcakes . 
good for you .   you &apos;ve got yourself the best guy in town . 
how much will it be ?   i warn you  -  don &apos;t give me a fancy price just because i &apos;m rich . 
you proud boy ,  why didn &apos;t you tell me you were having difficulties . 
how do you like that ?  we &apos;ve made twelve pictures together .  his greatest successes . 
no ,  you &apos;re not .   max !  max ! 
hey ,  what &apos;s this with the door ?  there isn &apos;t any lock . 
why ?   her career ?   she got enough out of it .   she &apos;s not forgotten .  she still gets those fan letters . 
sure you are .   and we &apos;re not help -  ing her any ,  feeding her lies and more lies .   getting herself ready for a pioture  .  .  .   what happens when she finds out ? 
and now ? 
hey !  ethan ! 
i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  i didn &apos;t know . 
there isn &apos;t any . 
thank you both so much .  it was a lovely lunch ,  mrs .  danvers .  i had a wonderful time .  and you &apos;re a terrific chess player mr .  danvers . 
what are you talkin &apos; about ? 
s &apos;not bad ,  s &apos;very good ,  but .  .  .  y &apos;know what &apos;s wrong with this .  .  .  singapore .  .  . thing ? 
you shouldn &apos;t say that ,  you &apos;re the chairman  -  -    .  .  . uh ,  chairperson .  .  . 
and three years after the royal wedding ,  the king abdicated .   isn &apos;t that terrible ? 
that song .  i remember one day i came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano .  and i thought  -  -  what am i going to do with all this potato salad ? 
no ,  well in this case i think i can speak for him .   i mean ,  i &apos;m pretty close to him ,  you know .   superman will be there on wednesday . 
awright .  i got me my electric train ,  mama .  i finally got  -  -   hey ,  what y &apos;all doin &apos; up there ?  ! 
i &apos;ll do more than tell you .  i &apos;ll show you ,  back at my place .  if you &apos;ll just do me one little favor first . 
don &apos;t you see ?  okay ,  so you didn &apos;t kill him .  nobody &apos;s perfect .  but that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn &apos;t a complete failure after all .   right after gus gave it to him ,  superman started to turn into a selfish ,  ornery ,  malicious ,  conniving .  .  . 
that &apos;s it !  the last tanker !  they &apos;re all mine now !  all .  .  . 
uh .   .   . 
maybe i could try  -  - 
hey ,  are you hungry ?  i &apos;m hungry . 
you &apos;ve been under a lot of pressure lately  - 
the one danger we have considered is that the phantom zone might  -  we cannot predict  -  just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space .  i cannot say i am glad you asked me that  - 
otis ,  your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate .  every man has a vulnerable point .  some like you otis ,  have more that one .  i didn &apos;t see superman &apos;s in time .  but now through patience ,  invention and skill ,  my  black box is just about ready . 
you must be freezing . 
perhaps there is some good in you after all ,  lex luthor . 
look ,  they need a machine to fly . 
he &apos;s captured non ! 
he &apos;s  .   .   .  cold .   .   . 
your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state ,  luthor . 
what &apos;d you call him ? 
weak sister .   i still can &apos;t figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out .  y &apos;know ? 
they stop for nothing . 
no news is not good news .  y &apos;know
boy ! 
it &apos;s a  .  .  . baby . 
we &apos;ll say he &apos;s a child to my cousin in north dakota ,  and just now orphaned .   poor thing . 
lois ,  the kickback story .  .  . 
the answer is yes .  now what &apos;s the question ? 
i &apos;m just fine ,  ally .   what about you ? 
so there were others ? 
i used to like it here .   i used to care about what happened .   now i think i &apos;ll sell my house and move the fuck away . 
well ,  it being so depressing and all .   but it &apos;s reality .   you can &apos;t just turn this off because you happen to think it &apos;s a bad idea . 
what do you mean ? 
you can only feel lucky that you didn &apos;t die for so long .   then you start to feel .  .  . unlucky . 
oh god ,  i &apos;m scared . 
no . 
this is before the accident ,  nicole .  do you understand what i &apos;m asking ? 
did you say anything to mrs .  driscoll ? 
how do you like it ,  nicole ? 
he couldn &apos;t look at me .   but i looked at him .   right at him .   his secret was mine now .   we used to share it .   but not anymore .   now ,  i owned it completely . 
that &apos;s right !   tell him ,  so i can read it in hunsecker &apos;s column first ! 
friends call me otis  -  sometimes tricky otis . 
don &apos;t tell me you started a polka with leo bartha ? 
i made you write a beautiful song .  .  . 
my god . 
what does that mean ? 
affirmative . 
and talking is talking !  well ,  i think we better get on . 
jeez .  and you think the british &apos;ll share it with their allies ? 
what ? 
so ,  how did you learn that the gestapo was out to get you ? 
yes ,  i know who he is . 
i said i have illegitimate children .  i don &apos;t know how many . 
one of your people told me . 
dr .  furtwngler is a great musician .  he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape . 
kyle ,  what &apos;s it like when you go through time ? 
not possible . 
it &apos;ll never be over ,  will it ?  look at me ,  i &apos;m shaking .  some legend ,  huh ?   you must be pretty disappointed . 
i &apos;ll give you a boost . 
i redecorated .   what about you ? 
your brother was a client with our london branch .   we do a sort of informal scoring .   his numbers were outstanding .   sure you &apos;re not hungry at all .  .  .   ?  tung hoy ,  best in chinatown .  .  . 
thank you . 
he couldn &apos;t ,  or refused to pay .   we extended credit .  .  . 
he hasn &apos;t called back . 
mister very talky ,  would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you ? 
it &apos;s still an electric shock ! 
you know what he &apos;s really upset about ? 
is there something about the house ? 
and what you &apos;re wearing ,  that &apos;s great ,  too . 
wait .   you &apos;re not wearing that ironically ?   this is really you ? 
i &apos;ll point you in the right direction ,  but you &apos;ll have to take it to the end -  zone .   he &apos;s a hit - and - run gunman  -  -  i figure he &apos;s not cruising the polo lounge . 
not me ,  man .   i &apos;m no drug dealer ,  what you think . 
useless gits .   i was gonna do the post office once . 
i was skint  -  -  didn &apos;t have no money to get here . 
i bet . 
this town &apos;s been chewing my flesh since  .  .  .  what we now refer to as  &quot; the early 70 &apos;s .  &quot;   christ ,  my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me . 
you don &apos;t seem bothered . 
overnight .   what about just now ? 
yeah ,  i guess you are . 
anyway ,  uh .  .  .  my point is you &apos;re young .  a kid really ,  your whole life ahead of you .  but it &apos;s not too soon to start thinking .  .  .  to start making opportunities for yourself .  before it all washes away . 
 .  .  . you bring a check ? 
 .  .  . you &apos;re not gonna screw me on this ? 
 .  .  . say ,  where do you get those things anyway ? 
rye . 
yeah . 
hello ! 
as soon as the doctor lets us ,  we gotta move you .  does he understand that ?  we &apos;re supposed to tell him .  are you conscious ? 
who are you ?   the undertaker ? 
look .   it &apos;s some kind of letter . 
you work here ? 
nothing .   i &apos;m in third grade .   what &apos;s a revolutionary what ch &apos;a ma &apos; callit ? 
shut them up ! 
mbwun . 
where exactly ? 
it &apos;s beautiful !   what are you waiting for ? 
i &apos;m thinking of getting out ,  marlon . 
 -  - what are my plans now ?   well ,  next i &apos;m thinking of tackling the yuba river in an authentic canoe from the algonquin tribe .   -  - i &apos;m talking about the north fork ,  a class five rapid  -  only i &apos;m not going down< / i> the yuba ,  i &apos;m going up . < / i>  do you honestly think for one minute i &apos;d go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents .  .  . do you ? 
it doesn &apos;t sound insane ,  truman .   i swear i see him ten times a week -  - in a hundred faces .   i almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last thursday . 
 -  - it doesn &apos;t matter .   everybody knows about it .   they know everything you do .  the point is ,  you got scared . 
they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma .  but you &apos;ve been unconscious since they brought you in . 
and if it &apos;s unsuccessful ? 
i think you &apos;re full of shit . 
a plague ? 
it &apos;s like jelly . 
she &apos;s missing .  we &apos;ve been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in . 
why are you telling me this ? 
you thought stargher wanted to be caught . 
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time . 
here he is . 
you &apos;re bettin &apos; the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows - what kind of shit ? 
anything really wrong with your papers ? 
 .  .  . and my lover .  he was harry . 
 .  .  . parents . 
there you are ,  miss ,  your receipt for the letters . 
must have known i was broke .  even sent me an airplane ticket .  it &apos;s a shame . 
do you see what that means ? 
look .  .  . i tell you ,  you don &apos;t think i &apos;m blind ,  do you ? 
paine lent me one of your books;  &quot; oklahoma kid ,  &quot;  i think it was .  read a bit of it .  .  .  think it &apos;s pretty good .  what made you take up this sort of thing ?  been doing it for long ? 
come upstairs a moment . 
it &apos;s far better thing that i do .  .  .  holly ,  you and i aren &apos;t heroes ,  the world doesn &apos;t make any heroes .  .  . 
martins . 
could he have been at all conscious ? 
i was told that he did not die at once . 
fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei . 
so there &apos;s an urban myth ,  well more of a rural myth ,  going around here at the moment .  it &apos;s about a beach . 
didn &apos;t you see raiders of the lost ark< / i> ? 
why no silencer ? 
 &quot;  .  .  . und die worte zerfielen mir im munde wie modrige pilze< / i> .  .  .  &quot; 
do you know it like that ?  by heart . 
i didn &apos;t realize you cared . 
why are you taking that ? 
they left an hour ago .   you mind some personal advice ?  forget carla .  that &apos;s not the side your bread &apos;s buttered on .   how soon can you get back to the city ? 
real men  -  -  white ,  christian men  -  -  we fuck a woman .  we make her come with our cocks .  but the jew doesn &apos;t like to penetrate and thrust  -  -  he can &apos;t assert himself that directly  -  -  so he resorts to perversions .  oral sex is technically a perversion ,  you know that ,  don &apos;t you ?   after a woman has been with a jewish man ,  she never wants a normal partner again .  a normal man . 
lina moebius .  and you are .  .  .  ? 
lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows . 
who &apos;s this ?

do you know how it is ?   do you know what you &apos;re supposed to do to meet a mermaid ? 
jacques .  .  .  ? 
but doesn &apos;t jacques dive without anything ? 
client notes .  sorry .   what can i do for you ? 
shabat shalom mama .  i brought some manischewitz .  the black label . 
mordechai .  do you love your mother ? 
mom !  we &apos;re eating ! 
hey everybody .  how &apos;s it hangin &apos; ? 
is someone with you  -  -  can i get you a drink ? 
yes ,  but what sort of a man ? 
pretty .  you know  -  -  it &apos;s funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now . 
i got into a little crap game . 
for your information ,  mr lombard ,  trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself .  though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that . 
minimizes the risks .  children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses .  these can also be used to move women and drugs .  .  .  anything that makes money really . 
is there anything to understand ? 
huh .  .  .  i have no .  .  .   .  .  .  hard evidence .  .  . 
then find another way . 
 .  .  . im emily stewart .  the hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year - old boy disappeared .  the pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat .  however i go about this thats who i am .  do you get what im fucking saying ,  mr lombard ? 
who are you ? 
must i speak to you in french ? 
what do you think has happened to your son ,  mrs spitz ? 
its about the puppy .  you got the money ? 
yeah .  why ?  youre going to look for her .  .  .  shit !  you really think his pictures are that good ? 
whats an hour of your time worth these days ,  nathalie ?   combien ,  nathalie ! 
mossad ? 
no ,  you must come ,  jeanne  -  -  we need you  -  -  so much has happened since you left .  .  .  i have a new horse now ,  a white one ,  just like yours .  .  .  and la hire hardly swears at all anymore .  .  .   you can &apos;t stay  -  -  they &apos;ll burn you ! 
but that was her order ! 
but we can &apos;t do that unless she admits to blasphemy .  .  . 
so .  .  .  here is the famous jeanne .  .  .  savior of orleans .  .  .  terror of the english ?   you look pretty ordinary to me .  .  . 
you must take the oath !   not even a king ,  would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith . 
don &apos;t worry ,  charles .   if god is still with her ,  she will be victorious .   we &apos;re not her judges .  .  .  we &apos;re just spectators .   let her go to compiegne ,  as you let her go to orleans ,  and let god decide her fate . 
because .  .  .  because  -  -  i mean  -  -  the english have a broad sense of humor ,  but .  .  .  i mean ,  you don &apos;t understand .  .  .  to them you &apos;re a witch ,  working for the devil .   what makes you think they &apos;ll listen to you ? 
my lord dunois .  .  .  i have wonderful news !   -  -  finally  -  -  he &apos;s sending her to us  -  -  thanks be to god  -  -  we &apos;re saved  -  -  it &apos;s wonderful ! 
yeah .  .  . 
i .  .  .  i never lied ! 
i am true  -  -  to my lord ,  the king of heaven .   he knows how much i love him  -  -  that &apos;s all that matters to me .  .  . 
god asked you to do something ? 
stop ,  stop .  .  .  i can &apos;t remember !   the battles were all so confusing .  .  .  there was so much smoke ,  dust ,  noise .  .  .  i was being attacked on all sides ,  so .  .  .  maybe .  .  .  perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself .  .  . 
we &apos;re recruiting . 
wladek ,  stop that .  it &apos;s over now .  just be proud it happened .  my god ,  did they put up a fight . 
they &apos;re in shock .  they didn &apos;t expect it .  nobody expected it .  jews fighting back ?  who &apos;d have thought ? 
no ,  no ,  no ,  i &apos;m staying put .  if i &apos;m going to die ,  i prefer to die at home . 
ohhh ,  it &apos;s so dark ,  it &apos;s like a dank cave . 
everyone has to practice . 
quiet down !  shhh !  where is she ? 
you ain &apos;t goin &apos; nowhere on that leg . 
straighten up ,  kid .   i wouldn &apos;t turn ya out if ya weren &apos;t ready .   i got a guy named henry gondorff i want you to look up .   there ain &apos;t a better insideman alive .   he &apos;ll teach ya everything ya gotta know . 
i &apos;m sorry about luther .   he was the best street worker i ever saw . 
i can &apos;t lay that off in time .   we lose a bet that big ,  it could break us . 
you really picked a winner ,  kid . 
lucky ,  hell .   i could do it every day . 
 &apos;cause it &apos;s better to do it all at once .   we &apos;re puttin &apos; down 400 grand next week .   at 5 - 1 we make 2 million .  twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us . 
there &apos;s word he &apos;s gonna run a con on the north side here .   we got a year - old florida warrant on him ,  but it &apos;s a thin beef ,  and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold .   all we want you to do is pick up hooker for us . 
he &apos;s gonna set up gondorff for us . 
mother  .  .  .  .   you couldn &apos;t do that .  you couldn &apos;t go to her . 
i don &apos;t believe it !  you &apos;re lying ! 
don &apos;t lie to me . 
he &apos;ll still be your son - in - law ! 
how &apos;d you people happen to pop in ? 
no proof ? 
where were you ? 
asta  -  don &apos;t bother mr .  macaulay . 
i see .   i see . 
i tell you  -  -  he didn &apos;t do it . 
i &apos;d tell you if i knew .  but i &apos;m not in this .   ask the police . 
morelli  -   you knew julia .   was she gypping wynant ? 
she didn &apos;t tell me a thing . 
you mean ,  he might be hiding there ? 
maybe miss wolf has them . 
you &apos;re out of your minds ,  you know that ?  both of you .   you don &apos;t even know if there &apos;s anything out there .   what the hell are you thinking ? 
we can &apos;t just leave him .   he &apos;ll run back to his outfit ,  report our position .  .  . 
that &apos;s what he says .   he could be a spy ,  or something . 
thanks for taking care of this for me . 
i don &apos;t see how that plan &apos;s any better . 
even if they are iraqis probably all they &apos;ll do is take us prisoner for awhile .   got to figure we &apos;re still kicking their asses in the war .   they don &apos;t want any trouble . 
what is this ? 
you &apos;re not saying what i think you &apos;re saying .   i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re even thinking it . 
it &apos;s got a bottom . 
i can just barely see him .   i think he &apos;s leaving . 
how do you know ? 
yes . 
top of my class at west point ,  thank you very much .  then off to redstone .  first half of the course we learned how to build devices .  .  .  second half ,  we &apos;d take them apart .  everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs .
