<s> No...
<s> You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
<s> Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
<s> I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
<s> Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
<s> You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
<s> Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
<s> Thank you, Daddy.
<s> You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
<s> Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
<s> Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
<s> I am afraid not.  Therefore -
<s> I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
<s> Atta-go.
<s> I'm doing what I can.
<s> Dunn.
<s> Ask Simon.
<s> Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
<s> Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
<s> Well, thanks, I --
<s> Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
<s> Yes.
<s> Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
<s> No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
<s> It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
<s> How could it not, Excellency?
<s> I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
<s> I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
<s> For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
<s> Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
<s> Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> He says he can't get away in the daytime.
<s> Okay, Matt.
<s> What?
<s> Sparkling rocks?
<s> Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
<s> Does he do this all the time?
<s> So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
<s> Let's see...  That you were with-
<s> Then you've gotta ask him about that.
<s> I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
<s> Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
<s> Yes?
<s> I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
<s> Hey, man, congratulations!
<s> C'mon, I knew it was you.
<s> ...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
<s> It's in my blood, Willy.
<s> What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
<s> No.
<s> He said that?
<s> I see.
<s> You're crazy --
<s> Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
<s> Hello.
<s> Stop what?
<s> Let's grab some food.
<s> Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
<s> I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
<s> Sing it to me.
<s> He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
<s> Come on.
<s> Actually. I've been in twice.
<s> Mother Mary, full of grace.
<s> Rule of thumb?
<s> My, my...
<s> I'll be back at 9:00.
<s> Maybe she turned.
<s> By who?
<s> But if we have not caught Wallace --
<s> What the fuck are you doing?
<s> Er, my check, please.
<s> Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
<s> There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
<s> Huh!
<s> I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
<s> You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
<s> Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
<s> Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
<s> I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
<s> One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
<s> But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
<s> All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
<s> Does he win?
<s> True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
<s> What was that, Doolittle?
<s> It didn't work?
<s> You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
<s> A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
<s> How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
<s> What?!
<s> That's okay.
<s> Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
<s> There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
<s> Justin?
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
<s> Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
<s> Totally.
<s> All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
<s> Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
<s> The door... on three.
<s> HELLLLLLLLP!!
<s> As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
<s> Well...
<s> But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
<s> I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
<s> I'll be back.
<s> Oh God.
<s> That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
<s> When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
<s> It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
<s> Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> If he isn't, then he's stupid.
<s> Ask your man here.
<s> Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
<s> Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
<s> Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
<s> FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
<s> -true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
<s> This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
<s> We'd better adjust our streams.
<s> So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
<s> I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
<s> Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
<s> You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
<s> I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
<s> This time...
<s> I'm a salesman.
<s> Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
<s> They were in the same creative writing class.
<s> "The sting."
<s> No.
<s> You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
<s> I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
<s> No, no. I just took it.
<s> You a doctor, too?
<s> In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> I've seen worse.
<s> I said: I found a room.
<s> "Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
<s> I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
<s> I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
<s> What is it? Here!
<s> Five hundred dollars.
<s> Get the Governor on the phone!
<s> Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
<s> You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
<s> It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
<s> I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
<s> Oook. Oook.
<s> Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
<s> All right. Five hundred.
<s> Oh no, nothing for me.
<s> I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
<s> You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
<s> Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
<s> I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
<s> Fly... yes. Land... no.
<s> I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
<s> Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
<s> Too late...They want you.
<s> No. Don't tell the guards.
<s> I don't know. I don't want to find out.
<s> Take a left and your next right.
<s> Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
<s> Yes. Joe.
<s> We insist.
<s> Oh yeah, thanks...
<s> Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
<s> Sir?
<s> Get some perspective, Lowell.
<s> My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
<s> You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
<s> Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
<s> . . . turn."
<s> knowbut
<s> Clever.
<s> Oh, excuse me. 
<s> Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
<s> Thanks. 
<s> Huh?
<s> ...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
<s> I had the cause of death.
<s> Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
<s> Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
<s> Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
<s> Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
<s> I am, as a matter of fact.
<s> I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
<s> Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
<s> She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
<s> Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
<s> Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
<s> What can I tell you?
<s> Her knee acting up?
<s> Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
<s> Nothin' much.
<s> How did it happen?
<s> The hull's imploding!
<s> I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
<s> Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
<s> I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
<s> You don't know anything about me!
<s> Are you looking for any other compensation?
<s> No it is not!
<s> I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
<s> ...I do.
<s> Why, what did he do?
<s> Sit down!
<s> What was suspicious about him?
<s> Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
<s> You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
<s> I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
<s> What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
<s> Yes. We lost five.
<s> The most beautiful woman in the world.
<s> Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
<s> Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
<s> OK.
<s> Salute.
<s> You like to take walks?
<s> I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
<s> What'd you do?
<s> Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
<s> I'm sending you back to Hell!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
<s> He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
<s> What have you been before today?
<s> Dad's home, already?
<s> Why didn't you take it?
<s> Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
<s> It ain't here.
<s> I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
<s> Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
<s> That turn you on there, RuPaul?
<s> Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
<s> How a Sandman lives.
<s> No, sir, it's not.
<s> No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
<s> So there are others?
<s> Is that all my story meant to you?
<s> Why not?
<s> It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
<s> I wanna make a deal.
<s> John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
<s> Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
<s> What does he think of your chosen line of work?
<s> That's the Red Ball Alarm.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
<s> Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
<s> They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
<s> Yes.
<s> Because...  I was already dead.
<s> ...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
<s> Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
<s> One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
<s> Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
<s> Why? You like my ass?
<s> Damnit!
<s> Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
<s> That ain't what your mama said.
<s> Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
<s> That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
<s> Didn't know you felt that way.
<s> It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
<s> No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
<s> What pictures?
<s> Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're a liar!
<s> Well--I can *manage*--
<s> That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
<s> Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
<s> He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
<s> Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
<s> He said... he was just looking for a good time.
<s> What?
<s> Me too.
<s> Come on.
<s> Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
<s> Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
<s> I don't want my windshield cleaned.
<s> Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
<s> I don't have to but I find it natural.
<s> Where is it?
<s> What?
<s> Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
<s> That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
<s> How's that?
<s> Yes ma'am?
<s> You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
<s> ...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
<s> I am. Hur you?
<s> No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
<s> Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
<s> All of the above, man...  And then some.
<s> You call that a compliment?
<s> That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
<s> By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> Oh sure it is.
<s> Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
<s> Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
<s> But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
<s> Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
<s> Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
<s> I'll never get close to anybody.
<s> Hi.
<s> ...never... tried...
<s> Stop it --
<s> Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
<s> Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
<s> Father, come in, please.
<s> Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
<s> The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
<s> You told Ann about this?
<s> Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
<s> Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
<s> We were supposed to play golf.
<s> Deep.
<s> They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
<s> See you over there, Miles.
<s> I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
<s> I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
<s> Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
<s> Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
<s> I would've come back for you.
<s> 'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
<s> Sleep good.
<s> It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
<s> She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
<s> Yeah. Security.
<s> What do they always say?
<s> Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
<s> Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
<s> Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
<s> That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
<s> You want the details?
<s> To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
<s> About 60 feet, Admiral.
<s> I demand to see the owners! I demand --
<s> From the mission...
<s> Picard to Crusher...
<s> I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
<s> I believe so.
<s> But how?
<s> I have the password right here.
<s> Still think we're finished?
<s> Aye, sir; thrusters...
<s> Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
<s> They're holding position.
<s> But I speak English.
<s> I understand.
<s> Leave him alone, Tran.
<s> It explains a lot.
<s> I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
<s> It was the mall.
<s> Thanks Tom.
<s> I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
<s> Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
<s> If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
<s> We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
<s> Then I'll call you a cab.
<s> She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
<s> Yep?
<s> Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
<s> I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
<s> Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
<s> Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
<s> So what's our problem?
<s> Was dark... find a light...
<s> MacReady...?
<s> I will...
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> I won't wait up.
<s> Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
<s> You mean now or before?
<s> What?!
<s> Really? I never got a message.
<s> So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
<s> Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
<s> Just a second, Mr. President.
<s> Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
<s> She's your sister?
<s> Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
<s> The girl with the purple fingernails?
<s> I don't know...
<s> We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
<s> I didn't ask for a closing argument.
<s> Yep, it sure is.
<s> I don't know, Sam.
<s> Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
<s> You know it and I know it.
<s> Yes. It would be.
<s> No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
<s> I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
<s> Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
<s> It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
<s> You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
<s> Fairy tales?
<s> They usually tell me.
<s> Me?
<s> Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
<s> What's your fucking problem?
<s> I'm alright, I'm dealing.
<s> That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
<s> Occasionally, but always with affection.
<s> They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
<s> At this time of the year there are so many boats...
<s> She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
<s> Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
<s> Yeah ... that's right.
<s> When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
<s> Clever.  George.
<s> Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
<s> We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
<s> How's Broussard?
<s> Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
<s> Do it.
<s> I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
<s> Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
<s> There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
<s> What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
<s> - in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
<s> --we will--
<s> Government. Recently retired.
<s> I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
<s> Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
<s> Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
<s> What about me?
<s> Pray he's color-blind...
<s> I should go
<s> Yeah, my grammy.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
<s> Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
<s> Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
<s> Hm.
<s> Are you working on a new book?
<s> Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
<s> I wonder...what...was it all...for...
<s> No!
<s> That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
<s> Sort of.
<s> He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
<s> Shot himself. What for ?
<s> Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
<s> Sure -- fine --
<s> You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
<s> Come here...
<s> It could blow over tomorrow, too.
<s> Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
<s> Ask him.
<s> Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
<s> Thank you for walking him.
<s> No.
<s> It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
<s> No.
<s> Why?
<s> When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
<s> Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
<s> I'll tell her you were here.
<s> For pay?
<s> You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
<s> Vanished. Thin air.
<s> What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
<s> ...Who is this?
<s> All of which he's now missin'.
<s> You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
<s> You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
<s> Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
<s> I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
<s> I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
<s> Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
<s> The attic.
<s> Do you think so? Do you think so?
<s> No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
<s> I'm saying they came into my yard.
<s> You was friends.
<s> What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
<s> What the fuck are you--
<s> Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
<s> Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
<s> It's because I'm human that I can do this.
<s> What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
<s> This isn't about us.
<s> And what's your excuse for being here?
<s> What do you mean...
<s> Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
<s> I'm not sick.
<s> Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
<s> I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
<s> Figured what out?
<s> I had a bad heart.
<s> What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
<s> No.
<s> How long you been married?
<s> What made you ask such a question?
<s> Then what do you care?
<s> Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
<s> You moved into this block?
<s> Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
<s> He can't kill you --
<s> Where's the fucking money?
<s> Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
<s> Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
<s> Not really, no.
<s> What?
<s> Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
<s> A half hour in the lobby.
<s> Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
<s> George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
<s> Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
<s> N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
<s> I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
<s> Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
<s> Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
<s> I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
<s> It's a damn convention.
<s> Would you knock it off, Sam?
<s> All right?
<s> Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
<s> Theo wants to talk again.
<s> I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
<s> You're up on your details, aren't you?
<s> Are you busting my chops or what?
<s> And what if you don't?
<s> He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
<s> Shouldn't take it personally.
<s> You'd know I wouldn't run off.
<s> Come here.
<s> Now you're angry.
<s> But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
<s>  Yeah...
<s> Come on.
<s> That is loud!  I'm 
<s> It doesn't hurt.
<s> Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
<s> I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
<s> Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
<s> Yes, Mr. Gittes.
<s> I'm sorry, I --
<s> Yeah.  Do you have any references?
<s> Well, you never know, do you?
<s> Charlie, please don't -
<s> Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> So what are you saying?
<s> Can't do it.
<s> That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
<s> Alexander de Large, sir.
<s> Amen. They cross themselves.
<s> No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
<s> Federal?
<s> No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
<s> I never learned jazz.
<s> No.
<s> Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
<s> There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
<s> You saw me standing alone ...
<s> It's a hoax.  I knew it!
<s> Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
<s> What are we going to do, take a taxi?
<s> Leave me alone -- !
<s> I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
<s> But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
<s> Screening calls. Any suggestions?
<s> No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
<s> Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
<s> Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
<s> In the car?
<s> Oh yeah?  Me, too.
<s> Yeah... Bedtime.
<s> We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
<s> What?
<s> Where is he???
<s> I want to go home, Merle.
<s> Merle --
<s> That's my problem, Belle.
<s> Yessir.
<s> He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
<s> He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
<s> I told you, he's got diabetes.
<s> What can he do, he's clean...
<s> Maybe...
<s> <i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
<s> Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>
<s> Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
<s> Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
<s> I can run out and get it.
<s> Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
<s> How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
<s> I bet you want your head scratched.
<s> Come on...
<s> Mm.
<s> Ray --
<s> Me?!
<s> As far as I know, they--
<s> Should we get a what?
<s> For what?
<s> Of course... But how?
<s> When can you get it here?
<s> Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
<s> Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
<s> There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
<s> He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
<s> You...you can't.
<s> Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
<s> A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
<s> It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
<s> It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
<s> I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
<s> Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
<s> That is why you fail.
<s> Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
<s> ...Perceval!
<s> Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
<s> No, she was heavily sedated.
<s> Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
<s> Who's in it?
<s> Thanks, but I've got plans.
<s> I just saw a man walk out of your room!
<s> So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
<s> You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
<s> Fine.  You?
<s> You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
<s> Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
<s> That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
<s> You'd never know it.
<s> Got it, teach.
<s> No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
<s> You want your own wife kidnapped?
<s> Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
<s> Ah, dammit!
<s> Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
<s> So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
<s> You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
<s> Answer me, Tyler.
<s> I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
<s> It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
<s> Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
<s> Where's Catherine?!
<s> I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
<s> No, the last time was three years ago.
<s> I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
<s> Encore du sho ping!
<s> Longbranch...?
<s> I hope so.
<s> Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
<s> In and out of bed.
<s> I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
<s> This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
<s> I've been doing my homework.
<s> I couldn't have... much longer.
<s> It's too...
<s> ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
<s> I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
<s> Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
<s> When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
<s> Boone.  Clayton Boone.
<s> I see.
<s> Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
<s> The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
<s> I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
<s> Let her carry this shit inside.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What places?
<s> Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
<s> Okay, sounds good.
<s> Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
<s> I guess that's what he looked like.
<s> Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
<s> Paul?
<s> What?... Oh baby...
<s> Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Yeah? Display?
<s> I think we've got something.
<s> Cancer?
<s> I don't want to look pushy.
<s> And I can't keep you interested?
<s> Sure.
<s> Mmm?
<s> I almost didn't.
<s> Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
<s> I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
<s> You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
<s> Hi.
<s> You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
<s> I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
<s> ...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
<s> Then we cannot go.
<s> Or clear your windshield with it.
<s> How do you mean?                                            ]
<s> We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
<s> I didn't. Cherry.
<s> Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
<s> You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
<s> I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
<s> "Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
<s> Who was that man last night?
<s> What's that next to him?
<s> But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<s> We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
<s> As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
<s> He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
<s> Anais, it is so good to see you.
<s> Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
<s> Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
<s> Sir, my leg is on fire!
<s> I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
<s> Am I right or am I right?
<s> Hey, it's a sellable skill.
<s> No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
<s> So you felt it too!
<s> I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
<s> Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
<s> Hero?
<s> I can go out if I want to.
<s> It's all controlled from the Control Room.
<s> Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
<s> What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
<s> There is something missing here.
<s> You okay?
<s> I'm not your brother!
<s> Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
<s> Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
<s> Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
<s> Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
<s> What about everything since?
<s> What do you think?
<s> Uh, huh?
<s> Ten.
<s> I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
<s> Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
<s> Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
<s> I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
<s> You know how much it is, Nick.
<s> Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
<s> I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
<s> He a Black man or an Indian?
<s> If the next guy's a redneck.
<s> We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
<s> And that was the last time you saw him?
<s> What was your deal with him?
<s> Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
<s> At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
<s> I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
<s> What's up, Sidra.
<s> I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
<s> No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
<s> Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
<s> Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
<s> ok.
<s> Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
<s> You'll find out - soon enough.
<s> We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
<s> Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
<s> Er, yes.  Speaking.
<s> "Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
<s> Know what?
<s> Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
<s> Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
<s> Gay?
<s> I have this condition -
<s> ...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.

<s> Two thirty.
<s> Immigration's gonna love you for that.
<s> I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
<s> It's good you found it.
<s> Which is?
<s> I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
<s> We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
<s> She was too young for him.
<s> Where's the ring?
<s> Through ... We found them.
<s> Got it?
<s> I'm going home.
<s> Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
<s> I love you too sweetie, bye.
<s> Just give it to me!!
<s> I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
<s> She admits it's her fault.
<s> I know that, Star.
<s> Okay.
<s> How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
<s> It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
<s> Yeah. Definitely.
<s> Everybody knows about--
<s> Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
<s> I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
<s> But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
<s> No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
<s> It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
<s> Definitely no comment.
<s> Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
<s> That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
<s> I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
<s> That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
<s> Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
<s> What?
<s> You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
<s> No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
<s> Gimme.
<s> It would seem so, Master.
<s> He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
<s> To warn her about Chino.
<s> I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
<s> I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
<s> Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
<s> There's a better place...
<s> You bet. We'll see you later.
<s> What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
<s> No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
<s> That's not enough.
<s> What are my orders, sir?
<s> Fuck off.
<s> Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
<s> Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
<s> Then why bother curing me?
<s> I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
<s> Sire.
<s> "Keep a shining in...
<s> There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
<s> It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
<s> I didn't think so.
<s> If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
<s> No foolin' -- any suspect?
<s> Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
<s> Morning after?
<s> I'll be waiting.
<s> That so.
<s> I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
<s> ...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
<s> Welcome.
<s> They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
<s> Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
<s> Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
<s> Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
<s> We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
<s> No.  But I'll help you.
<s> Sir, I can explain.
<s> I kissed him back.
<s> They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
<s> "Dear Sleepless and Son..."
<s> The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
<s> I was scared of what you were gonna do.
<s> Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
<s> I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
<s> In West Fork?
<s> Get back to your positions!
<s> Thanks, Joel.
<s> There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
<s> You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
<s> Guessing at this point is useless.
<s> Oh... um, William.
<s> Sir?
<s> When I have fifty pounds.
<s> It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
<s> But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
<s> I don't know what to...
<s> What, do you think I planned it?
<s> I'm exaggerating.
<s> -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
<s> -- these bastards have me hemmed in.
<s> All right.
<s> Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
<s> A nigger.
<s> How do you like it?
<s> I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
<s> Experience!  Right?
<s> Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
