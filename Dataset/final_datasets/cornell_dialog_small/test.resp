<s> I believe we share an art instructor
<s> Fifty, and you've got your man.
<s> Not bad.
<s> No.  No way.
<s> I'm heading out. How about you?
<s> Shut up.
<s> Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
<s> Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
<s> She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
<s> All right - go to it.
<s> This town sucks.
<s> Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
<s> Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
<s> What do you want with us?
<s> Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
<s> I think so.
<s> I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
<s> I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
<s> Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
<s> Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
<s> I can't!  Do you mind!
<s> Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
<s> Did you ever have a baby?
<s> Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
<s> So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
<s> People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> What is what?
<s> David?
<s> Shall we?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
<s> I got us through the War all right.
<s> Sparkling rocks?
<s> That's...that's too bad.
<s> 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
<s> Got out of my other commitment.
<s> No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
<s> Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
<s> ... love...
<s> Pity your mother came, too ...
<s> Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
<s> The car for Debbie?
<s> So does Debbie.
<s> Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
<s> Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
<s> Yes.
<s> You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
<s> I didn't mean that, in life.
<s> What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
<s> Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
<s> I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
<s> Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
<s> You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
<s> No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
<s> I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
<s> It's not mine either.
<s> That young lady's size, right'cher.
<s> I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
<s> Cool?
<s> What's the problem here?
<s> What?!
<s> Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
<s> Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
<s> Who?
<s> The front stairs.
<s> Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
<s> Of course, I'll be careful.
<s> Have you taken leave of your senses?
<s> Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
<s> It was fifteen minutes late.
<s> Fine. That's all there is to it then.
<s> *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
<s> That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
<s> Two million.
<s> Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
<s> I hate public transport.
<s> You know where I'm from?
<s> I'll watch.
<s> Armed.
<s> Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
<s> Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
<s> Not right now?  Okay, when?
<s> I've been in love with her since the second grade.
<s> Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
<s> I've always thought that myself.
<s> You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
<s> I'll bring it back.
<s> The Gods are asleep, Erik.
<s> The Clock People?
<s> I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
<s> There must be a way! What about Engineering?
<s> Alive?
<s> Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
<s> You're lying...!
<s> Should?
<s> Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
<s> Got it, teach.
<s> You're right. I didn't tell you that.
<s> That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
<s> It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
<s> See you next weekend, Dad.
<s> And you think it's worth all this?
<s> Good.
<s> Are you an actor?
<s> No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
<s> You kill me, Mama.
<s> I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
<s> She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
<s> Open this door for no-one!
<s> Good call.
<s> As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
<s> What's in Mexico?
<s> It's not your fault, it's her fault!
<s> He needs our help!
<s> No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
<s> What's  your name, son?
<s> Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
<s> The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
<s> I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
<s> But it's more than just that, am I right?
<s> Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
<s> Maybe a few times I have.
<s> Morning, skipper.
<s> I don't know. Tuesday?
<s> Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
<s> I bet you did.
<s> Nope.
<s> Yeah, thanks.
<s> That's okay...
<s> I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
<s> I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
<s> Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
<s> We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
<s> I told you, I ...
<s> I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
<s> Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
<s> Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
<s> My troops don't make policy.
<s> Well -- I said I might marry him.
<s> Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
<s> Yes.
<s> How about art.
<s> Is it?
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> The house is not full -- Is it really full?
<s> I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
<s> It's not going to happen.
<s> She has a master's degree in English literature.
<s> You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
<s> Why can't I meet him now?
<s> Harold Chasen.
<s> Those things never work. Never.
<s> I don't want to see the dress.
<s> I want to see.
<s> Please. I want to see you home. All right?
<s> So?  You even said they're good.
<s> Why?
<s> I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
<s> You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
<s> You've been listening to rumors.
<s> Gee! Take a look, will you?
<s> I notice you still remember it.
<s> That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
<s> I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
<s> Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
<s> Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
<s> I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
<s> Just sit back and enjoy the show.
<s> And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
<s> It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
<s> If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
<s> Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
<s> You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
<s> The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
<s> Good point.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Oh...Gooood!
<s> Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
<s> Keep thinking.
<s> We insist.
<s> Me still. They left you alone?
<s> What's he done?
<s> It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
<s> ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
<s> Try the car.
<s> You're a peculiar chap.
<s> Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
<s> You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
<s> Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
<s> I need a favor.
<s> You don't say.
<s> The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
<s> Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
<s> I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
<s> I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
<s> I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
<s> It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
<s> Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
<s> Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
<s> No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
<s> I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
<s> You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
<s> Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
<s> No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
<s> Yeah. Do it again.
<s> Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
<s> I thought you said the line was busy?
<s> Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
<s> So?
<s> It's not a Theta --
<s> Or perchance...
<s> You follow.
<s> A violation?
<s> He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
<s> Here.
<s> Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
<s> Anybody else have a key to the house.
<s> I... I didn't say anything...
<s> Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
<s> Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
<s> Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
<s> Why?
<s> Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
<s> The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
<s> Not quite.
<s> Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
<s> Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Take a few days --
<s> What drill?
<s> What about boxing?
<s> No. What is it?
<s> [No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
<s> Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
<s> Well?
<s> I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
<s> We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
<s> Yes, I believe he has --
<s> LET'S DO IT!?
<s> Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
<s> I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
<s> THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
<s> Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
<s> Never.
<s> Shut up, Diz.
<s> This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
<s> That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
<s> Why, of course.
<s> One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
<s> I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
<s> Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
<s> Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
<s> What?!
<s> When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
<s> Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
<s> Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
<s> I see...
<s> Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
<s> My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
<s> Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
<s> Thanks for the help.
<s> Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
<s> Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
<s> Brave... that's right.
<s> It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
<s> Did he have to die for me to get it?!
<s> I know ...
<s> But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
<s> I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
<s> You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
<s> It's not really a good time, guys...
<s> And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
<s> Yeah, it's me.
<s> Lovely.
<s> Very well.
<s> Boy overboard!
<s> Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
<s> You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
<s> The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
<s> You can't walk out of here like this.
<s> It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
<s> Oh, George ...
<s> No. Of course not.
<s> What department store did they go to?
<s> It's terrible, no.
<s> You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
<s> Orson, please ... it's too bright
<s> Who asked you?
<s> What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
<s> I was jaywalking.
<s> You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
<s> Nothing, thank heaven.
<s> Well--
<s> Do you hear from him, son?
<s> I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
<s> Nick, I love you --
<s> You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
<s> What for?
<s> Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> You do.
<s> I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
<s> It says, "Ray."
<s> Is there a killer loose?
<s> I understand.
<s> You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
<s> Well, what? Is he dangerous?
<s> Cynthia!
<s> Is that what he tells you?
<s> Brian Kirkland, please.
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
<s> Good!  I'm gonna be there.
<s> Slaughterhouse.
<s> You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
<s> I'll pay for it.
<s> That ain't right.
<s> Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
<s> You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
<s> Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
<s> I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
<s> What'll we do?
<s> I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
<s> Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
<s> Not for long, you ain't.
<s> Now, you just find him, son.
<s> Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
<s> No... We're trying to save Heller.
<s> Security's locking down the elevators.
<s> Rheya.
<s> How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
<s> She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
<s> Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
<s> Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
<s> He would not have spoken of it openly.
<s> Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
<s> I'm going down to the station.
<s> As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
<s> Right.
<s> If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
<s> We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
<s> Confirmed, Captain!
<s> Sorry, sir.
<s> Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
<s> On my way.
<s> You can stop. I will go on alone.
<s> So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
<s> Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
<s> How long does it last?  Oh.
<s> Not as much as you'd think.
<s> How long ago?
<s> What?!?
<s> Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
<s> Until the old man tells me different.
<s> No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
<s> I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
<s> Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
<s> I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
<s> For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
<s> Huh?
<s> She already has a daughter.
<s> I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
<s> ...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
<s> "Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
<s> I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
<s> Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
<s> What?
<s> Little over two hours.
<s> Then you came to a desert and mountains...
<s> I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
<s> No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> The thing's kind of heavy.
<s> Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
<s> Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
<s> Still heading for Cuba.
<s> Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
<s> Ray --
<s> What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
<s> This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
<s> Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
<s> Roger Baron.
<s> For control of the prison drug trade?
<s> I can't help you there.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> Someone's gonna see us.
<s> Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
<s> Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
<s> Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh... yeah.
<s> Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
<s> And why haven't they left each other?
<s> I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
<s> Do you remember the night they said it came?
<s> She'd get angry.
<s> Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
<s> What?
<s> At least it can't get up here now.
<s> Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
<s> What can I do?
<s> It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
<s> Do it.
<s> Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
<s> I understand she is now the understudy in there.
<s> What did you expect - live sables?
<s> Behind in your dues? How much?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Not at all...
<s> Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
<s> We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
<s> He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
<s> A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
<s> I know, it sucks!
<s> Sorry, I thought you were dead.
<s> After getting laid?
<s> You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
<s> Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
<s> I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
<s> Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
<s> You have a raccoon?
<s> But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
<s> We can show her the schoolyard.
<s> I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
<s> Yes.
<s> Would you like to meet my husband?
<s> Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
<s> I just want to go brush my teeth --
<s> No -- just come as you are.
<s> I can handle it.
<s> -- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
<s> Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
<s> That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
<s> You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
<s> Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
<s> The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
<s> Know what?
<s> WE gotta think of something.
<s> Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
<s> Whatever!
<s> The dirty snowball at its core.
<s> But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
<s> You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
<s> I thought you quit.
<s> When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
<s> Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
<s> Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
<s> That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
<s> It's you and Mom that need to talk.
<s> And live in what, our station wagon?
<s> Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
<s> I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
<s> Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
<s> Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
<s> No problem, Chief.
<s> Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
<s> You bastard.
<s> Well--
<s> Huh?
<s> But I just got here --
<s> No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
<s> I don't...I don't understand them myself.
<s> I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
<s> --I don't know.
<s> Tuesday.
<s> I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
<s> Here?
<s> Of course I am.
<s> No.
<s> No -- you're not.
<s> How long you been married?
<s> Nah.
<s> Why?
<s> Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
<s> You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
<s> She say she in great pain.
<s> Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
<s> Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
<s> Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
<s> Nobody else had it.
<s> Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
<s> In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
<s> Not if you're careful.
<s> I gotta bail.  You coming?
<s> You want some punch?
<s> Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
<s> In so many words, yes.
<s> Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
<s> What do you need?
<s> A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
<s> You won't disconnect.
<s> The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
<s> You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
<s> I still don't see you.
<s> Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
<s> Charming.
<s> Who's she?
<s> What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
<s> Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
<s> Leave me alone -- !
<s> Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --

<s> It must've happened right after we left.
<s> There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
<s> You sure?
<s> What pictures?
<s> I said I'll drop it.
<s> Including the death of your husband?
<s> All she needed for that was the phone book!
<s> But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
<s> Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
<s> -  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
<s> Can we not talk about this?
<s> I swear.
<s> I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
<s> Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
<s> Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
<s> What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
<s> I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
<s> Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
<s> Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
<s> ...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
<s> Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
<s> I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
<s> But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
<s> I have no idea.
<s> David --
<s> 'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
<s> What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
<s> You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
<s> Don't be ridiculous.
<s> We had a deal.
<s> Wait!  I'm a friend!
<s> She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
<s> I'm looking for a good guitar man.
<s> No.
<s> Great book.
<s> I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
<s> Doing what?
<s> Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
<s> I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
<s> How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
<s> All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
<s> But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
<s> I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
<s> So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
<s> Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
<s> God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
<s> Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
<s> What is it man?
<s> No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
<s> You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.

<s> H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.

<s> What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
<s> Sorry, comb got caught.
<s> I am a man.
<s> Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
<s> Can we eat there tomorrow?
<s> I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
<s> Shut up!
<s> Right.
<s> You can't talk that way about my movie.
<s> Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...

<s> We're excited.

<s> In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
<s> Dean's with Lyle.
<s> Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
<s> What?  No!
<s> I don't know what that means.
<s> Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
<s> Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
<s> I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.

<s> You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
<s> Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
<s> What would I do with it? Run amok?
<s> Thank you.

<s> Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
<s> This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
<s> Pour it in your ear.
<s> I think you know, Frank.
<s> You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.

<s> That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
<s> And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
<s> This is my brother's car.
<s> I see.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Go ahead.
<s> He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
<s> All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
<s> Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
<s> They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
<s> Get out of here, then. Now.
<s> I dunno ...
<s> And Tracy's on the move ...
<s> If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
<s> Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
<s> Well, he didn't show up for work today...
<s> Cause fuck him, that's why.

<s> Yeah. On my way home now.
<s> Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
<s> I'm not happy.
<s> I spoke to your father the other day.
<s> That's not true.
<s> Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?

<s> Yeah.
<s> You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!

<s> You seen John Brigham...?
<s> That's bullshit. Just shoot.

<s> No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
<s> You can't really believe that.
<s> Up the organization!  Bastard.
<s> I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
<s> Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
<s> You're not a psycho!
<s> I can't do it.
<s> You have fed. You were made for this...

<s> That lunch was the worst, huh.
<s> What?
<s> Where is she now?
<s> Are you okay?
<s> I've been hearing you.
<s> Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
<s> Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.

<s> -- no.
<s> Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
<s> I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
<s> Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
<s> You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
<s> It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
<s> Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!

<s> Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
<s> Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...

<s> Nah uh.
<s> Oh, Jesse...
<s> Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.

<s> Who's Goble?
<s> Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
<s> That's not enough.
<s> I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--

<s> Dinner can wait.
<s> We're letting them slide?
<s> I ought to be after twenty years.
<s> No one of consequence.
<s> You found Buckley?
<s> Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.

<s> No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
<s> Yo, can I have my locker back?
<s> Forget it.
<s> Romeo, I drink to thee.
<s> Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
<s> OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
<s> Do what?
<s> You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
<s> No.  She's a school teacher.
<s> Fine by me.
<s> Maintain eye contact.
<s> That must have made you proud.
<s> That doesn't make any sense.
<s> Actually, he sounded nice.
<s> This conversation is finished.
<s> You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
<s> I did forget. Lus told me.
<s> Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
<s> That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
<s> Plenty.
<s> Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
<s> No.

<s> Yes.
<s> Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
<s> Really?
<s> Mary Clarence!

<s> Would you like that?
<s> How?
<s> A hiding place.
<s> Pull on your works. Your privates.
<s> Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
<s> Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
<s> Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
<s> Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
<s> You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
<s> I was checking the cables.
<s> Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
<s> Mom, please.
<s> That's right--
<s> I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
<s> What?
<s> Valdomet.
<s> Leave me alone, Norman.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Wait!
<s> "We are friends".
<s> Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
<s> For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
<s> I'm on it !
<s> Departure angle.
<s> Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
<s> What's it called?
<s> Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
<s> One moment.
<s> No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
<s> She's a...
<s> Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
<s> I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
<s> Is he cool or angry?
<s> Alright starve.
<s> Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
<s> We have to talk.
<s> Hunh.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
<s> Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
<s> Oh, you were there?
<s> He is.
<s> Sooze.
<s> I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
<s> Kitchen. . . Technician
<s> He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
<s> Ask, You're the girl reporter.
<s> Well I don't.
<s> I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
<s> Why?
<s> You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
<s> She intends to change the future somehow.
<s> Yes, von der Null.
<s> Stop talking to them!
<s> Robbed?
<s> A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
<s> Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
<s> Try calling me again.
<s> We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Did she make mistakes?
<s> What is it, Dave?
<s> I didn't say a word.
<s> I know.
<s> Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
<s> You can count on it.
<s> Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
<s> I've been using you?!
<s> No.
<s> Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
<s> Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
<s> Who even knew?
<s> ...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
<s> No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
<s> Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
<s> Where? Where did you find it?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
<s> You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
<s> You splendid bastard...
<s> To marry you.
<s> If there was, I didn't see it...
<s> Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
<s> Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
<s> There is something to be said for silence
<s> Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
<s> I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
<s> I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
<s> Oh, God!
<s> Violation?
<s> Yeah, just a nick ...
<s> She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
<s> Where did you find it?
<s> No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
<s> Just as you say, Doctor.
<s> I know!
<s> Ever had a romance with a crook?
<s> That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
<s> Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
<s> Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
<s> At seven-thirty?
<s> Get it!
<s> You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
<s> You'd die for fun?
<s> - Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
<s> No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
<s> Of course.
<s> Hopefully, it won't get that far.
<s> Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
<s> Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
<s> I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
<s> Then I guess I'm going by myself.
<s> I feel like a traitor.
<s> An informant.
<s> No. On you go.
<s> No.
<s> OK, so who was it, then?
<s> Goodnight, Bones.
<s> No way.  Not Dana.
<s> Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
<s> That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
<s> Do you still have friends on the force?
<s> Nope.
<s> McTeague.
<s> Or a supporting actor -
<s> 'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
<s> I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
<s> I said come on!
<s> Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
<s> Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
<s> Maybe I don't want you to.
<s> My mother died in this canyon.
<s> Like what?
<s> Nothin's bent.
<s> Ah? That complicates the problem.
<s> I -- I --
<s> What is it, a still life?
<s> The hell you do.
<s> I think so.
<s> Right before the wedding?
<s> Now?
<s> Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
<s> Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
<s> You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
<s> My...secret.
<s> ...that's the general idea.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then why did you?
<s> ...just so she could cut them off.
<s> Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
<s> Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
<s> Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
<s> I guess.
<s> My parents always say hard work builds character.
<s> In other words, our scope is too narrow.
<s> I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
<s> That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
<s> I miss Dad.
<s> I'm going to hit you.
<s> He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
<s> She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
<s> Not one this big.
<s> Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
<s> I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
<s> Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
<s> What?
<s> It makes you nervous?
<s> Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
<s> Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
<s> It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
<s> Poppycock!
<s> Yes!... the laboratory.
<s> No, Fred ereck.
<s> They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
