<s> Forget it.
<s> Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
<s> Where?
<s> At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
<s> I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
<s> Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
<s> You burn, you pine, you perish?
<s> She kissed me.
<s> What do you think?
<s> How much?
<s> I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
<s> The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
<s> Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
<s> Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
<s> The land is there.  I know it!
<s> What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
<s> It was my decision, not his.
<s> Answer it.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
<s> See you later.  Good luck.
<s> We have no money.  Come on.
<s> Don't want to film this?
<s> What does it look like?  It's an address book!
<s> Sit down!
<s> No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
<s> No way!  He's mine!
<s> There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
<s> I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
<s> Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
<s> Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
<s> I want to pick up my car.
<s> Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
<s> Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
<s> Musta got some primo bondsman.
<s> I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
<s> Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
<s> Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
<s> Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
<s> So you do know her.
<s> Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
<s> Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
<s> Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
<s> You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
<s> Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
<s> What mission?
<s> And the third one?
<s> All 900.
<s> Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
<s> I told you not to read all that crap!
<s> Yes, Sir!
<s> What are you... ?
<s> Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
<s> That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
<s> They're no friends of mine.
<s> Interesting theory.
<s> I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
<s> I'm a working stiff, pops.
<s> "Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
<s> It got to be too much for him.
<s> You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
<s> Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
<s> I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
<s> Kristen...
<s> Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
<s> How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
<s> Yeah.  I'm just aces.
<s> I don't know!
<s> Then we'll find another way.
<s> That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
<s> Faint.
<s> He invited me to his house last night.
<s> So they caught up with you, too?
<s> <u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
<s> Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
<s> After torpedo room:  Report!
<s> You played for the Sox?
<s> Hmm.
<s> Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
<s> Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
<s> No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
<s> Yes.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Where's Jill?
<s> Yeah, lots.
<s> You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
<s> Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
<s> Nothing.
<s> You think Jack shot him?
<s> Your father never means to be so...
<s> Some kids were teasing you?
<s> Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
<s> Yes
<s> Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
<s> One thing I've learned as
<s> Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
<s> No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
<s> You better check it, Unger.
<s> Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
<s> What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
<s> How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
<s> Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
<s> Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
<s> That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
<s> Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
<s> I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
<s> Yes...
<s> Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
<s> We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
<s> ... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
<s> Sure.  Just a minute.
<s> Yes.  That follows.
<s> Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
<s> But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
<s> Alive?
<s> About seventeen days.
<s> Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
<s> In a harem.
<s> Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
<s> Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
<s> No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
<s> You borrowed money from your mother?
<s> Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
<s> Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
<s> He asked me to stay.
<s> Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
<s> Really?
<s> Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
<s> Yes.
<s> I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
<s> You go fast!
<s> He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
<s> I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
<s> David?
<s> Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
<s> I swear, I don't know this girl.
<s> No, but we're about to.
<s> I was having a nightmare.
<s> What are you going to see?
<s> Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
<s> Take it easy, Clark.
<s> Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
<s> Don't you know?
<s> Happy now?
<s> Sure, I think it's swell.
<s> You're protecting somebody.
<s> If he can do it, yes.
<s> Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
<s> Oh, is that so?
<s> Jim Younger, I told you--
<s> Zee, I'm pleased you came.
<s> Swear on Jimmy's grave.
<s> There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
<s> Of course!  Uh, sir?
<s> On account of we're robbing it.
<s> Jesse, we're outlaws.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
<s> She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
<s> Yes ma'am.
<s> I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
<s> Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
<s> Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
<s> Is your Evian spiked?
<s> Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
<s> Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
<s> Sorry. 
<s> Hello? Jean, I need help!
<s> Patrick, you re a lunatic.
<s> Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
<s> I think his family wants this kept quiet.
<s> Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
<s> Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
<s> Wait. That's not what I've got.
<s> That's not the information I've received.
<s> Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
<s> I've been great. And you?
<s> If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
<s> Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
<s> ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
<s> It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
<s> You're famous around here.
<s> The Day Care?
<s> Certainly not at my happy home.
<s> What?!
<s> My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
<s> Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
<s> Sea bass.
<s> You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> ... power ...
<s> Promised? Who promised?
<s> You're mad.
<s> Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
<s> It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
<s> Possibly. Split personality ...
<s> Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
<s> You are, and it's behind you.
<s> He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
<s> Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
<s> When do the girls get to the party?
<s> He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
<s> I don't want that. I want to be with you.
<s> I am committed. I love you.
<s> Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
<s> Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
<s> No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
<s> I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
<s> Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
<s> Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
<s> What, are you kidding? By myself?
<s> Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
<s> I know.
<s> Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
<s> "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'll be there, goddamn it!
<s> How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
<s> You like everybody, Ronald.
<s> I forgive you.
<s> My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
<s> Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
<s> Mantan!!
<s> Calm down, please.
<s> This is Cheeba.
<s> Hello.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
<s> I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
<s> No.
<s> ...the big apple, New York, New York.
<s> For what?  He left.  Not me.
<s> The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
<s> O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
<s> I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
<s> What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
<s> Yes, papa.
<s> You wanna bet?
<s> No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
<s> No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
<s> But you didn't.
<s> Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
<s> I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
<s> Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
<s> Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
<s> What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
<s> No --
<s> Stop.
<s> What's your name, Giant?
<s> Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
<s> Beats me.
<s> So how does it happen?
<s> It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
<s> Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
<s> You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
<s> It's nothing. I burnt myself.
<s> Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
<s> John.
<s> So you're just going to be vindictive
<s> Why not?
<s> It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
<s> I'm not asking you to marry me.
<s> You liked what I brung ya?
<s> Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
<s> Sure.
<s> Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
<s> You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
<s> Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
<s> Beats forty hours on a plane.
<s> Nick, we can't just --
<s> I hope not.
<s> We can't lose.
<s> You could fake it.
<s> This by this...
<s> It is not allowed.
<s> Why don't you ask your chief detective?
<s> If anything happens to her while I'm here --
<s> You're androids.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Dr. Tyrell?
<s> Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
<s> What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
<s> I think we're through for the night.
<s> Ya.
<s> What's suck night?
<s> You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
<s> I don't know nothing about it.
<s> I bet I would.
<s> Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
<s> I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
<s> So?
<s> Can you?  I couldn't.
<s> Not too good.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> Sorry.
<s> What?!
<s> Oh, I could die...
<s> Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
<s> What?!
<s> Maybe. But that's how it works.
<s> Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
<s> Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
<s> Yes.  Well... yes.
<s> Mutants?!
<s> Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
<s> No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
<s> I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
<s> I wanted to see you.
<s> Well.
<s> Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
<s> You want to see him too, right?
<s> Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
<s> I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
<s> It's good to see you, Dad.
<s> Terrible boring.
<s> Maybe so.
<s> Where are they?
<s> Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
<s> Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
<s> Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
<s> Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
<s> Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
<s> I'm strangely comfortable with it.
<s> So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
<s> We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
<s> No. We didn't.
<s> Careful. Check his pulse.
<s> Scale the --
<s> No. Bob did.
<s> Why'd you want to help us?
<s> Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
<s> Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
<s> That's your domain.
<s> No. I was calm.
<s> The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
<s> Don't threaten me, Bob.
<s> Stand by. Bird Dog?
<s> We're just going over a few things.
<s> Jesus...
<s> Okay... 
<s> What?
<s> Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
<s> You mean, did I want a date?
<s> Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
<s> It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
<s> Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
<s> Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
<s> What? What could he do?
<s> My journals! Where are they?
<s> Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
<s> You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
<s> Been there, done that.
<s> I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> -- Will he keep his word?
<s> How long can I afford to stay closed?
<s> We said "no questions."
<s> All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
<s> -- Yes?
<s> -- This is Mr. Laszlo.
<s> My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
<s> You seem to know all about my destiny.
<s> But everybody's having such a good time.
<s> Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
<s> Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
<s> Catch another fish tomorrow.
<s> I've got lots of time.
<s> You smell like formaldehyde.
<s> He's your cute thing.
<s> So did I.
<s> Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
<s> It was fifteen minutes late.
<s> Good night, Daddy.
<s> He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
<s> Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
<s> That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
<s> I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
<s> I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
<s> You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
<s> No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
<s> You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
<s> So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
<s> Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
<s> LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
<s> What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
<s> Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
<s> Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
<s> No, I want my cut!
<s> You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
<s> Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
<s> Escorts!
<s> You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
<s> We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
<s> Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
<s> What do you get out of it?
<s> Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
<s> Sorry.
<s> Never. Why do you ask?
<s> Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
<s> It's not that.
<s> Well, thank you anyway.
<s> You're serious.
<s> All right, Mr Reynolds.
<s> Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
<s> I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
<s> Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
<s> Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
<s> No time.
<s> The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
<s> We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
<s> She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
<s> I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
<s> With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
<s> What guys do.  'Nother order.
<s> She's gonna want to hear for herself.
<s> Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
<s> Theo's dead.
<s> Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
<s> Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
<s> The easy way.
<s> You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
<s> You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
<s> Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
<s> A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
<s> Not until like... eighth grade.
<s> Who?
<s> Frank is going to kill.
<s> Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
<s> No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
<s> No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
<s> "My dear"...
<s> Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
<s> $50?
<s> I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
<s> He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
<s> Did you see it?
<s> What is it?
<s> Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
<s> I am very pleased to meet you.
<s> I knew you'd understand. Here.
<s> Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
<s> Yes! The workhouse!
<s> Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
<s> No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
<s> Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
<s> Why... should YOU care?
<s> I know!
<s> Look out!
<s> What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
<s> Relax!
<s> DEATH TO DRAGONS!
<s> I'm not nuts.
<s> See, I wouldn't think that about you.
<s> It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
<s> You pick it.
<s> No.
<s> That's scary sounding.
<s> Oh, um...
<s> Did you send this? Is it a joke?
<s> That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
<s> There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
<s> Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
<s> 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
<s> I'm staying with the Countess.
<s> Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
<s> Hold on, Coop...
<s> Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
<s> Start the countdown.
<s> Justin. I won't let you die.
<s> You're insane. You've lost your mind.
<s> External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
<s> I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
<s> You've been working out.
<s> Right, whatever, have fun.
<s> Johnny.
<s> I gave him twenty.
<s> Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
<s> It's the first door on your left!
<s> Don't strain yourself.
<s> I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
<s> Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
<s> I think they're both virgins.
<s> There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
<s> He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
<s> Really?
<s> GO?
<s> It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
<s> Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
<s> She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
<s> Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
<s> C'mon guys--
<s> What?
<s> The girl's got rhythm.
<s> Huh?
<s> You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
<s> You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Fifteen.
<s> Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
<s> For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
<s> You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
<s> ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
<s> Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
<s> Yes, Mama.
<s> Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
<s> I see.
<s> You're telling me you feel guilty.
<s> Nothing can. Not ever.
<s> Your decision. For us.
<s> Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
<s> It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
<s> I finished the boats.
<s> Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
<s> Get behind him more.
<s> Coach, athletic director somewhere.
<s> Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
<s> To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
<s> Jacob.
<s> Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
<s> So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
<s> -- you got your microwave --
<s> Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
<s> I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
<s> You believe me don't cha?
<s> I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
<s> Yes, dear.
<s> Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
<s> Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
<s> Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
<s> Just like you would be.
<s> This has nothing to do with you.
<s> I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
<s> That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
<s> It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
<s> You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
<s> Show us where you are, Chief.
<s> Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
<s> Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
<s> You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
<s> You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
<s> But you don't know for sure!
<s> You were right.
<s> Is that the bathroom?
<s> What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
<s> All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
<s> Let me think. I need time to think.
<s> Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
<s> They always say that.
<s> Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
<s> That can't be.
<s> Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
<s> I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
<s> More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
<s> That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
<s> Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
<s> Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
<s> You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
<s> That's all.
<s> Never heard of him.
<s> I'm in the movie business.
<s> I'm a producer.
<s> It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
<s> What've you got?
<s> Harry, lemme give you some advice.
<s> I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
<s> He drown?
<s> So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
<s> You have it?
<s> How'd you know I was here?
<s> I know what a vig is.
<s> Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
<s> They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
<s> It looks like it.
<s> Too big. More like a freighter.
<s> Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
<s> You're up late.
<s> We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
<s> Help me what?
<s> No.
<s> "Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
<s> We should follow them!
<s> As always.
<s> He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
<s> That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
<s> We were such desperate sluts back then.
<s> Yeah, I guess... call me...
<s> Really? Both of you?... Why not?
<s> Tell me what?
<s> I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
<s> Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
<s> I really didn't get a good look at her.
<s> I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
<s> No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
<s> Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
<s> I won't even dignify that with a response.
<s> So, what happened?
<s> I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
<s> I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
<s> Right.
<s> You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
<s> Then why do you stay?
<s> Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
<s> Does he speak English?
<s> Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
<s> We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
<s> Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
<s> I have to ask- why do you need me?
<s> You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
<s> Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
<s> I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
<s> I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
<s> -- the sorrow --
<s> I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
<s> You were the one who got me in.
<s> You need the exercise.
<s> This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
<s> This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
<s> I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
<s> Are you sick, Louis?
<s> All right.
<s> I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
<s> No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
<s> Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
<s> There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
<s> I can see that...
<s> Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
<s> Lucky it didn't step on his head.
<s> Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
<s> I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
<s> I'd love some.
<s> If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
<s> No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
<s> Because it isn't true.
<s> Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
<s> Get out!
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
<s> Are you tired of it?
<s> About five years.
<s> Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
<s> What?
<s> -- worried?
<s> The pearls are in her room.
<s> No --
<s> That.
<s> You are beautiful!
<s> Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
<s> No -- not at all.
<s> You're tired. I can see that.
<s> Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
<s> I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
<s> That's from skiing.
<s> Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
<s> Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
<s> Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
<s> You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
<s> Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
<s> Why? What's wrong?
<s> I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
<s> I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
<s> That's just Lilly's way.
<s> And when he got serious?
<s> I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
<s> Shit, Linda!
<s> To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
<s> Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
<s> I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
<s> I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
<s> I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
<s> Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
<s> I'm talking to you gently now.
<s> Situation.
<s> And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
<s> He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
<s> He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
<s> Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
<s> Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
<s> Would you say that again?
<s> I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
<s> I'm utterly satisfied.
<s> No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
<s> Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
<s> Still lives with his mother.
<s> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
<s> Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
<s> You mean I'm black?
<s> Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
<s> You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
<s> Um-hm. Live sound.
<s> Who's paying you?
<s> Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
<s> You're welcome.  Did you know him?
<s> Look.
<s> Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
<s> Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
<s> I have a sore throat.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
<s> Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
<s> Red, I found something --
<s> No. It's not.
<s> Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
<s> Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
<s> It's important.
<s> No.
<s> Hi. I got soaked.
<s> Are you alright ?
<s> Don't let them take me, Steve --
<s> Really.
<s> But now I kind of like it.
<s> That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
<s> Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
<s> Maybe I should talk to him.
<s> Think about it, Rob.
<s> Hi.
<s> Just ask it!
<s> I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
<s> I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
<s> I'm going to talk to you.
<s> I'm sure it isn't.
<s> I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
<s> I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
<s> No, we...
<s> Why?
<s> Good day, Miss Cartwright.
<s> Go home.
<s> The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
<s> No!
<s> You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
<s> Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
<s> You know me home.  Me name.
<s> This is madness!
<s> I have no future husband.
<s> You'd think he'd had practice.
<s> Offered the Pope one of his whores.
<s> But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
<s> Why don't you fellows get your own news?
<s> I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
<s> It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
<s> If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
<s> Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
<s> Well, haven't you got anybody else?
<s> No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
<s> I know, but --
<s> Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
<s> Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
<s> What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
<s> It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
<s> What's the dope, Sheriff?
<s> You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
<s> Hold her, boys!
<s> Earl Williams. The reprieve.
<s> I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
<s> Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
<s> -- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
<s> Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
<s> You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
<s> Bugger off.
<s> It's easy. I've done it.
<s> That's it.
<s> A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
<s> No, I won't.
<s> I know you mean well.
<s> I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
<s> Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
<s> Oh yeah, the tree.
<s> You shouldn't a done that.
<s> How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
<s> Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
<s> How much further?
<s> We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
<s> There's not enough room.
<s> You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
<s> Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
<s> I don't know, I think he's funny.
<s> No please, let me sit this one out.
<s> Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
<s> Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
<s> Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
<s> Where we headed?
<s> Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
<s> Not at all.
<s> I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
<s> You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
<s> Really?
<s> Do you?
<s> Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
<s> Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
<s> Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
<s> Packard. Sarah Packard.
<s> I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
<s> You ever played billiards before?
<s> Thought you only drank milk.
<s> What is?
<s> Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
<s> Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
<s> I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
<s> 'Bout even.
<s> What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
<s> Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
<s> What kind of straight pool game you like?
<s> You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
<s> So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
<s> You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
<s> Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
<s> Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
<s> I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
<s> At school. It's Thursday.
<s> Why did he tell you?
<s> Leave now.
<s> No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
<s> That's right.
<s> You watch me.
<s> You're not them.
<s> Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
<s> Stay alive.
<s> I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
<s> Did it work?
<s> That's the good news?
<s> I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
<s> The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
<s> Better than we thought.
<s> How to kiss ass.
<s> We're already over Mach 2!
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
<s> It looks like a converted church.
<s> Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
<s> So it did.
<s> Where is it? I want it.
<s> Junior!
<s> Good point.
<s> Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
<s> No.
<s> Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
<s> No.
<s> I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
<s> He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
<s> A what?!
<s> It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
<s> You've got to go to sleep now.
<s> No... they won't kill me.
<s> What for?
<s> For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
<s> Wait.
<s> Probably.
<s> And Dieter?
<s> Where've you been?
<s> You're lovely.
<s> JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
<s> RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
<s> It'll remind me of you.
<s> Well what?
<s> Been hearing voices.
<s> A little voice in my head.
<s> Oh...I can't. Business.
<s> One chip?
<s> I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
<s> I know a nice island.
<s> Tear it apart?
<s> Poor bastard.
<s> What does he know?
<s> ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
<s> No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
<s> Catch you later.
<s> You're sure you want to do this?
<s> Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
<s> Yes, it's on the stove...
<s> I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
<s> "60 Minutes"?
<s> Who are these people?
<s> Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
<s> Good. I want to talk to you.
<s> No.
<s> I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
<s> There is -- there is no family.
<s> You're gonna get your fix...
<s> Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
<s> And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
<s> Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
<s> You want Botox?
<s> Asian? No.
<s> It's your move, Miles.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> To him? He's a sick freak.
<s> Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
<s> They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
<s> ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
<s> Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
<s> The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
<s> Why don't you put me in chains?
<s> I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
<s> Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
<s> You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
<s> Are you talking to me!
<s> Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
<s> We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
<s> Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
<s> You bet I did.
<s> Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
<s> I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
<s> Isn't he here?
<s> How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
<s> Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
<s> Collect?
<s> You're not kidnapping her, are you?
<s> But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
<s> Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
<s> Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
<s> Frank, I don't want to hear it.
<s> The anonymous kind, Chief.
<s> Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
<s> Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
<s> Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
<s> Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
<s> Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
<s> You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
<s> Ever ask him?
<s> Virginia.
<s> I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
<s> What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
<s> You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
<s> Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
<s> That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
<s> She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
<s> I thought you might want a drink?
<s> You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
<s> You went out this morning and bought a gun.
<s> What?... What'd you do?
<s> Do you think they bought it?
<s> I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
<s> Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
<s> They already know it's you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Detroit.
<s> Who's arm is that?
<s> Then what?
<s> Fuck you for asking me that.
<s> I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
<s> Did the police contact you?
<s> If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
<s> Hello, Sam.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
<s> Used you?
<s> I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
<s> Jezzie, I can't see.
<s> I don't believe this.
<s> Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
<s> So why tell me now?
<s> Sometimes. When it's convenient.
<s> God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
<s> She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
<s> Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
<s> The hull's imploding!
<s> At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
<s> Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
<s> We have to get off this ship.
<s> The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
<s> Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
<s> You're crazy!
<s> He's taken him!
<s> Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
<s> All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
<s> I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
<s> Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
<s> Ever see one like this?
<s> No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
<s> But you copy my work every week.
<s> Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
<s> Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
<s> I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
<s> Blood and guts.
<s> Why?
<s> No?
<s> You mean like couples?
<s> Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
<s> ...I said, I like your hair.
<s> You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
<s> How much do I owe you?
<s> He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
<s> Forget about it, doesn't matter.
<s> Fuck!
<s> Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
<s> Where's Adele?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Umm. Altogether?
<s> Right.
<s> He looks like my uncle.
<s> Who?
<s> How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
<s> Yeah probably.
<s> Yeah. Do it again.
<s> No.
<s> And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
<s> I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
<s> Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
<s> Not really.
<s> She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
<s> Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
<s> For what?
<s> Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
<s> Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
<s> I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
<s> I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
<s> What do you want on it?
<s> Frank told me.
<s> In the old books. It's called a glaive.
<s> Yes.
<s> Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
<s> Saddles.
<s> I am Quell.
<s> It's right behind you.
<s> It is important to assure the succession.
<s> Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
<s> Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
<s> OK.
<s> ...I got lost, Mister.
<s> Go to sleep Ellen.
<s> I told you.
<s> Why know?
<s> I do.
<s> Good morning.
<s> No -- S.E.R.A.
<s> Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
<s> Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
<s> Where have you been staying?
<s> You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
<s> Yes.
<s> What'd you do?
<s> Margot!
<s> Did she do that to you, too?
<s> Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
<s> Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
<s> Is he the only one?
<s> I got bangs!
<s> Why not?
<s> I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
<s> I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
<s> Cunnilingus?
<s> Always.
<s> You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
<s> And who might that be?
<s> Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
<s> The colt's still too small.
<s> Blackheart?
<s> We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
<s> I've not heard a note out of you.
<s> Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
<s> Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
<s> Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
<s> That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
<s> She's dead!
<s> Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
<s> I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
<s> That very nice.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Here, honey!
<s> I'll get your back.
<s> I've been dreading you.
<s> Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
<s> I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
<s> Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
<s> You let him pierce his nose?
<s> Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
<s> It's not my back that's killing me.
<s> What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
<s> Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
<s> You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
<s> Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
<s> Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
<s> Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
<s> You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
<s> That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
<s> I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
<s> Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
<s> My dad's an optometrist.
<s> Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
<s> What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
<s> I didn't say that I would run... I just...
<s> A Runner gave it to me.
<s> I won't.
<s> I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
<s> What?
<s> Sure, I'm okay.
<s> Or something.
<s> No, honey... It was part of the deal.
<s> The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
<s> Yes. Might as well - all of it.
<s> It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
<s> I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
<s> Hey!
<s> I wonder.
<s> It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
<s> Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
<s> I wanna make a deal.
<s> Show me just Agatha's data stream.
<s> How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
<s> All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
<s> What does he think of your chosen line of work?
<s> It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
<s> No.  He got tired of pretending.
<s> We know why John was tagged.
<s> I padded your expense account for the last six months.
<s> I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
<s> If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
<s> You shouldn't. He likes you.
<s> Me? No. Not really.
<s> He's not here.
<s> To keep?
<s> Pretty nice.
<s> Shhh... Hello, room service?
<s> And where might that be?
<s> Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
<s> Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
<s> I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
<s> A black man playing big league ball is something.
<s> No, Brother Minister.
<s> Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
<s> Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
<s> It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
<s> [South America.]
<s> [Who's he?]
<s> I came to visit you.
<s> Maybe...
<s> It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
<s> I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
<s> You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
<s> Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
<s> He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
<s> Hospital.
<s> Back home.
<s> When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
<s> That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
<s> Except we forgot one other small thing.
<s> All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
<s> I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
<s> Oh, yuh did, huh?
<s> Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
<s> Yeah, a little.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
<s> He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
<s> "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
<s> ...a car.
<s> We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
<s> Explain how that works.
<s> So what do I say to this guy?
<s> Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
<s> The jockey!
<s> I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
<s> I ain't interested in your life story.
<s> I was going to catch the last half on TV.
<s> In Europe women find older men very sexy.
<s> There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
<s> At least a day.
<s> Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
<s> No.
<s> -- Katie.
<s> Her?
<s> It was a test.
<s> What?!
<s> ... I just pray we're not too late.
<s> OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
<s> And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
<s> I ain't no fuckin' kike!
<s> Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
<s> Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
<s> For being a bootlegger?
<s> Who?
<s> How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
<s> Masseria's been after me too.
<s> Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
<s> Olive. - Where exactly am I?
<s> Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
<s> Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
<s> Susan? Nah!
<s> Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
<s> Aw--
<s> Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
<s> Mr. President--
<s> And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
<s> The man downstairs said number--
<s> Convene?
<s> It *is* not!
<s> No--
<s> I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
<s> He's lost complete faith in me--
<s> Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
<s> It's crucifying him--!
<s> No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
<s> No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
<s> Oh, I don't mind.
<s> I'd like to read it some time.
<s> No, I don't mind.
<s> I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
<s> What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
<s> Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
<s> Me, sir?
<s> Perfect! Perfect!
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
<s> Oh, they insisted on following me.
<s> I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
<s> Christian Svenson.
<s> Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
<s> Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
<s> What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
<s> Hmm?
<s> Tastes good.
<s> ...And?
<s> Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
<s> Is she a friend of yours?
<s> Martin.
<s> About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
<s> You've got a funny idea of funny.
<s> It's a big part of the show.
<s> Really?
<s> Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
<s> You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
<s> "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
<s> See you Thursday... regular time.
<s> -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Who was talking about what?
<s> Um, well, you see...
<s> But you're a superhero.
<s> Me.
<s> And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
<s> It's suicide.
<s> Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
<s> Are you serious?
<s> Yes, sire?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
<s> I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
<s> Open the door.  It's me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
<s> No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
<s> Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
<s> I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
<s> I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
<s> If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
<s> Not me.
<s> Still gonna smell it.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
<s> Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
<s> That's my girl.
<s> Yes, I'm listening.
<s> You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
<s> Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
<s> Hm!
<s> Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
<s> John don't like him much.
<s> John! Don't!
<s> You do?
<s> You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
<s> Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
<s> I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
<s> You didn't get legal advice?
<s> Oh, yes, yes.
<s> Monsieur.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
<s> Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
<s> That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
<s> The telephone is ringing.
<s> I don't like your following me.
<s> No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
<s> No. Nobody will find us.
<s> A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
<s> No.
<s> That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
<s> Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
<s> Where the hell is he?
<s> Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
<s> Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
<s> It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
<s> It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
<s> Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
<s> I know ...
<s> That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
<s> Yes, Mr. President.
<s> That was Mr. Kennedy.
<s> They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
<s> Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
<s> No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
<s> I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
<s> No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
<s> Okay.
<s> You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
<s> In the truck.  I'll get it.
<s> No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
<s> It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
<s> Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
<s> Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
<s> You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
<s> The one you were telling me about?
<s> Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
<s> What? Where was he?!
<s> Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
<s> Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
<s> If we're for real?
<s> We know that...
<s> Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
<s> What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
<s> No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
<s> You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
<s> Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
<s> Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
<s> Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
<s> Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
<s> I am. Hur you?
<s> Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
<s> Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
<s> Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
<s> My kinda group!
<s> Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
<s> I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
<s> I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
<s> You know how this gotta end.
<s> Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
<s> Do me a favor and don't talk.
<s> Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
<s> I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
<s> I saw something, I saw...
<s> Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
<s> They were empty...
<s> You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
<s> Bullshit...
<s> Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
<s> Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
<s> Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
<s> He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
<s> If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
<s> And what do they know?
<s> No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
<s> You'll see soon enough, hon.
<s> Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
<s> That's enough, Ellen.
<s> Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
<s> That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
<s> A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
<s> Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
<s> I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
<s> By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
<s> My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
<s> Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
<s> You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
<s> My father -- was not -- a pirate!
<s> I'll lead them away.
<s> It's the right way.
<s> It's ready now, I know it is.
<s> You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
<s> Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
<s> What did he want?
<s> Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
<s> Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
<s> What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
<s> It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
<s> The question is, are you?
<s> Why
<s> Is that so?
<s> Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
<s> Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
<s> Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
<s> Must be my wife.
<s> Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
<s> Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
<s> Me, sir?
<s> Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
<s> Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
<s> A bird in a gilded cage?
<s> Really Biff? The keenest?
<s> Okay, that's IT!!!
<s> Okay--that's enough!
<s> They don't notice that kind of thing.
<s> They just grow like that?
<s> We'll just put up the top.
<s> Just a little--You know.
<s> Yeah. 
<s> I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
<s> Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
<s> Ok.
<s> What?
<s> Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
<s> Wait a minute --
<s> For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
<s> "With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
<s> But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
<s> Enough to discern its tenor.
<s> Was it impotence?
<s> It's a formality; truly.
<s> And his writing?
<s> All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
<s> A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
<s> Randolph!
<s> Who the hell's Manolete?
<s> Yeah, ain't it swell?
<s> I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
<s> Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
<s> You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
<s> Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
<s> Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
<s> I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
<s> It's OK.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
<s> All right, I'll try. See you later.
<s> I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
<s> Like an old hambone?
<s> It's me.
<s> I don't know what you mean.
<s> I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
<s> Well, the salesman could be available soon.
<s> It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
<s> Tired?
<s> There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
<s> To get on home.
<s> The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Too close.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure.  Sure.
<s> We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
<s> I need it.
<s> Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> Just tell a little white lie?
<s> I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
<s> Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
<s> Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
<s> We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
<s> Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
<s> No. It's her brother.
<s> When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
<s> No, Gabriel... no...
<s> How'd you know my name.
<s> Take 'em.
<s> Show's over.
<s> Not with you.
<s> What?
<s> How'd you know I'd do it.
<s> Where was she from, Compton?
<s> That's okay, Eddie, I do.
<s> Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
<s> He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
<s> What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
<s> Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
<s> Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
<s> Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
<s> Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
<s> I suppose that's my fault.
<s> I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
<s> Would they be good to eat?
<s> Thanks, Steve.
<s> Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
<s> Hello Ray.
<s> Shit!
<s> Saw who?!
<s> NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
<s> One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
<s> Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
<s> If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
<s> They may have been friends of hers.
<s> I'd forgotten.
<s> Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
<s> Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
<s> Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
<s> We haven't even begun tea yet.
<s> What's the first?
<s> Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
<s> The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
<s> I know.
<s> Yes.
<s> Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
<s> You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
<s> No.
<s> Not entirely.
<s> Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
<s> You bitch. I knew it.
<s> Is he still at your house?
<s> Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
<s> Hold on.
<s> Nope.
<s> Yes.
<s> I turn on the camera. You start talking.
<s> Look, I'll call you, okay?
<s> By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
<s> Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
<s> YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
<s> Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
<s> Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
<s> Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
<s> I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
<s> I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
<s> And?
<s> Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
<s> Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
<s> Bathroom.
<s> My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
<s> Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
<s> Yeah. Thanks.
<s> Does she ever answer back?
<s> I don't feel much.
<s> A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
<s> You're scaring your sister.
<s> You'll lose the signal!
<s> I guess I put a good scare into him.
<s> Why?
<s> Luck, I guess.
<s> Stella.
<s> He left me.
<s> Excuse us.
<s> If it's on the page...
<s> Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
<s> He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
<s> I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
<s> Don't you?
<s> She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
<s> You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> Your eyes told me.
<s> Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
<s> S-ssssstop it!
<s> You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
<s> Book of Jeremiah.
<s> Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
<s> ...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
<s> Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
<s> Spider.
<s> He tried to kill you, Starla.
<s> I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
<s> I got to leave my post.
<s> If...?
<s> Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
<s> Having fun.
<s> We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
<s> Weight Station.
<s> You have a butler working that floor?
<s> And threw us into the lake.
<s> I was kinda hoping, yeah.
<s> Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
<s> I don't see it like that at all.
<s> -- okay, g'head --
<s> I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
<s> Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
<s> What do you want?
<s> Why did you agree to come here?
<s> Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
<s> To who?
<s> Why?
<s> I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
<s> My Thomas is a little rusty.
<s> A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
<s> Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
<s> This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
<s> Your what...?
<s> Be happy.  He's good at this.
<s> No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
<s> So, what are you doing tonight?
<s> No. No, that's okay.
<s> Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
<s> Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
<s> No!
<s> Actually, I got this spider bite
<s> You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
<s> That'll do.
<s> You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
<s> Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
<s> Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
<s> Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
<s> Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
<s> They'll shoot you, Animal!
<s> I don't care if they wear galoshes!
<s> Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
<s> I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
<s> Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
<s> We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
<s> I believe so.
<s> Yes, where would you go?
<s> I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
<s> Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
<s> A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
<s> They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> A photon tube...!
<s> You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
<s> But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
<s> Yes, my lord!
<s> Put him on screen!  Study him well.
<s> But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
<s> For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
<s> As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
<s> We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
<s> Maybe...
<s> I saw it -- !
<s> Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
<s> Aye, sir --
<s> He'll die -- !
<s> How far?
<s> Aye sir --
<s> Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
<s> Energize defense fields.
<s> Understood, sir.
<s> Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
<s> Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
<s> Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
<s> No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
<s> Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
<s> It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
<s> Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
<s> Sir, heat shields at maximum!
<s> Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
<s> Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
<s> Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
<s> Weapons systems?
<s> Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
<s> Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
<s> The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
<s> I understand.
<s> Are they in any danger?
<s> How about a passive radiation scan?
<s> Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
<s> I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
<s> Augh?
<s> I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
<s> Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
<s> You're lying.
<s> This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
<s> Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
<s> Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
<s> Yes...
<s> We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
<s> We must do this again soon.
<s> Candidate for what?
<s> Sir?
<s> We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
<s> I am uncertain.
<s> I think  not.
<s> No.
<s> Can you describe it, Deanna?
<s> That was another time.
<s> I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
<s> It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
<s> Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
<s> Gear shift.
<s> No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
<s> Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
<s> Horses.
<s> I do not understand.
<s> Is that a baby?
<s> I was afraid.
<s> Many, many days and nights...
<s> Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
<s> Pull over. I've got to get back there.
<s> I wouldn't think so.
<s> Tonight.
<s> Can't do it.
<s> Tell me.
<s> I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
<s> Thanks, Max.
<s> Let's talk in the car.
<s> I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
<s> No, it's not.
<s> What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
<s> An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
<s> The man knew how to dress.
<s> Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
<s> I guess I'm a little paranoid.
<s> Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
<s> Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
<s> Why? You're not a real man?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
<s> They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
<s> You didn't have to get into it, baby.
<s> No, baby. You're money.
<s> Chelios to Roenick...!
<s> Like hell I will.
<s> No, just you and Paulie.
<s> Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
<s> When did he call?
<s> Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
<s> You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
<s> Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
<s> Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
<s> You know I love spaghetti.
<s> Let HER ask.
<s> Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
<s> Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
<s> No!
<s> That's good.
<s> Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
<s> What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
<s> Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
<s> He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
<s> I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
<s> You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
<s> I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
<s> But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
<s> Of course. What happened to your face?
<s> Oh. Who was that again?
<s> Well, I don't follow movies too much...
<s> I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
<s> Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
<s> Yeah.
<s> O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
<s> He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
<s> My work may take me out of New York.
<s> Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
<s> How's your driving record?
<s> O.K., cowboy.
<s> Slow.
<s> I'm a field agent.
<s> Now they only have three rockets left.
<s> The cell, Mason.
<s> Well...
<s> You look... different.
<s> That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
<s> Thanks.
<s> We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
<s> Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
<s> Mother.  She's beautiful.
<s> Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
<s> Yeah, well, that's enough.
<s> Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
<s> No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
<s> In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
<s> Take them.
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> What name?
<s> We'll make our own fog.
<s> Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
<s> No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
<s> Monday?
<s> That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> San Francisco's a long way from here.
<s> Yes, but...
<s> Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
<s> Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
<s> No, I have my things in the car.
<s> Don't let's take any chances.
<s> Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
<s> No one ever said you were, Mitch.
<s> I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
<s> Aye.
<s> I can't.
<s> Don't call me that confounded name.
<s> I've drunk enough tonight.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
<s> Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
<s> Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
<s> That was my first question.
<s> That's what I came to see you about.
<s> He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
<s> A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
<s> I don't care about the rest of the world!
<s> Remember those words.
<s> No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
<s> Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
<s> To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
<s> Did we have a date tonight?
<s> This is Michael.
<s> C'mere, Nanook.
<s> I hope so.
<s> Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
<s> No.  On the phone.
<s> The Marines.
<s> What's it going to do, being a plant?
<s> Hell no.
<s> It's shorted out or something!
<s> What's that?
<s> It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
<s> Yes.
<s> The Morlocks didn't build this.
<s> Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
<s> Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
<s> Alex, it's just the zoo.
<s> Let them.
<s> You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
<s> His home.
<s> Yes...
<s> Thank you...
<s> Thank you.
<s> You liked it there.
<s> No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
<s> Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
<s> I took a different route.
<s> No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
<s> How?
<s> I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
<s> [Beat] I don't know.
<s> Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
<s> Is it true?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> In the leg.
<s> Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Alright, Louise!
<s> ... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
<s> Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
<s> Yep.
<s> I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
<s> What's that?
<s> Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
<s> A fucking moron.
<s> She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
<s> Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
<s> Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
<s> Healy.
<s> Puffy, get over here.
<s> No, that's really unneces --
<s> He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
<s> Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
<s> He was.
<s> Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
<s> You're my hero, Carl.
<s> That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
<s> No way, Cooch.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
<s> Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
<s> So they took care of Leo.
<s> He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
<s> Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
<s> Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
<s> Why?
<s> Not to me.
<s> That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
<s> I was, later.
<s> I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
<s> You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
<s> Saving them some paperwork.
<s> How's it goin', Coog?
<s> Over there man.
<s> This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
<s> I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
<s> But I'm always home by morning.
<s> Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
<s> Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
<s> Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
<s> You two-faced-bastard.
<s> What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
<s> We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
<s> Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
<s> Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
<s> She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
<s> Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
<s> I can describe it.
<s> I specialize, Roger...
<s> "Have to"? No...
<s> I feel much better now.
<s> You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
<s> Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
<s> Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
<s> That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
<s> Someone else has it now.
<s> What happened to her?
<s> I'll get my kit.
<s> Who would do that?
<s> Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
<s> They were looking for wood.
<s> Fine.
<s> Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
<s> It's a crime.
<s> No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
<s> I'm just an M.D.
<s> Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
<s> Yes.
<s> How old is he?
<s> Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
<s> Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
<s> Yes. Price...
<s> Nothing happened.
<s> ...fifty thousand dollars?
<s> Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
<s> I'm swell.
<s> You use their witness.
<s> Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
<s> Huh. And why is that?
<s> Right.
<s> He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
<s> You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
<s> Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
<s> It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
<s> Yeah...how'd you know?
<s> Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> Like this!
<s> I guess.
<s> It was my fault.  I slipped.
<s> It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
<s> Shut up donut.
<s> He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
<s> I don't know...
<s> That's right... Take one of these.
<s> Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
<s> Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
<s> Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
<s> I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
<s> Hell, peanut...
<s> Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
<s> Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
<s> Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
<s> ...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
<s> My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
<s> If you say so.
<s> NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
<s> Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
<s> I thought you were tinkering.
<s> Tripp, where the hell...
<s> They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
<s> They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
<s> Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
<s> I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
<s> James'll know about George Sanders.
<s> At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
<s> A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
<s> Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
<s> Over there. In the backseat of the...
<s> Oh... yeah.
<s> Give me a break, Grady.
<s> No shit.
<s> I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
<s> I'm not a monster.
<s> Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
<s> I suppose it's however society defines it.
<s> I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
<s> The worst?
<s> Maybe you should be.
<s> I'm alright, I'm dealing.
<s> No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
<s> That must be it.
<s> Bud, something really important is happening here.
<s> Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
<s> Yeah.  So sue me.
<s> Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
<s> I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
<s> Yes.
<s> What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
<s> Better dead.
<s> You say that just to flatter me.
<s> But then why did you bother changing?
<s> What has everybody got against me this morning?
<s> But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
<s> What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
<s> Yes Mother.
<s> God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
<s> Oh, there are so many.
<s> Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
<s> Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why?
<s> What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
<s> None as far as I know.
<s> Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
<s> It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
<s> Then help her.
<s> No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
<s> Oh, some time in January.
<s> What is it?
<s> About what?
<s> Oh God, if only I'd known.
<s> She is an innocent.
<s> That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
<s> Not much cop without 'em, is it?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
<s> Ah ... a shamus, eh?
<s> Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
<s> Hello.
<s> Well, yes your nose is. Very.
<s> He'll get over it.
<s> Shurrup, cheerful.
<s> Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
<s> I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
<s> No, I want to go in.
<s> Play it for us, please.
<s> About four hours.
<s> Food-storage room!
<s> Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
<s> Who gets the privilege?
<s> Shit.  When?
<s> You win some, you loose some.
<s> What?
<s> It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
<s> It's alright, it's cool...
<s> Where does that lead to?
<s> Okay.
<s> Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
<s> Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
<s> Why not?
<s> Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
<s> Huh?
<s> Where?
<s> Here we go...
<s> Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
<s> I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
<s> Oh-oh.
<s> Now you want an argument.
<s> It couldn't possibly interest you.
<s> I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
<s> Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
<s> That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
<s> I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
<s> I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
<s> I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
<s> A couple of weeks.
<s> The telephone calls... we know about that.
<s> It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
<s> Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
<s> Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
<s> --right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
<s> --Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
<s> OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
<s> Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
<s> I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
<s> You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
<s> The what to what?
<s> I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
<s> I believe the kegs are upstairs.
<s> Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
<s> You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
<s> Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
<s> Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
<s> Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
<s> ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
<s> What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
<s> No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
<s> Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
<s> Okay, don't stop.
<s> No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
<s> Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
<s> What...?
<s> It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
<s> Why isn't it doing anything!?
<s> He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
<s> Yeah?
<s> My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
<s> It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
<s> You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
<s> Sad?
<s> I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
<s> You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
<s> Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
<s> Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
<s> Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
<s> Oh, yeah, yeah.
<s> That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
<s> Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh! My God! 
<s> It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
<s> What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
<s> "Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
<s> Oswald and ghosts.
<s> He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
<s> Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
<s> I look pretty.
<s> A triumph.  When did you get here?
<s> Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
<s> Anymore.
<s> I love you, Joe Therrian.
<s> Fantastic.  Out here.
<s> We've only been over this how many times?
<s> Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
<s> Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
<s> But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
<s> I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
<s> "How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
<s> I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
<s> I hope they're watercolors!
<s> Wait!  When can I see you again?
<s> How should <u>I know</u>?
<s> Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
<s> Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
<s> It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
<s> YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
<s> Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
<s> Care to make a small wager?
<s> I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
<s> The mirror -- it's broken.
<s> Give what up?
<s> All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
<s> Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
<s> The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
<s> Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
<s> It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
<s> Sure.
<s> Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
<s> What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
<s> It's a thought.
<s> None.
<s> At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
<s> Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
<s> First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
<s> In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
<s> I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
<s> I got bored in Saigon.
<s> Just something I read in the Free Press.
<s> Wait a second.
<s> That's my line.
<s> Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
<s> No!!! Stay away from me!
<s> I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
<s> No. No. Get Carol.
<s> I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
<s> If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
<s> You little stinker. He's given you everything.
<s> You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
<s> Do you realize that I work at him?
<s> Get out.
<s> I'm going back with you.
<s> If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
<s> You would be.
<s> I'm worried about you, Robert.
<s> The contract?
<s> 'Them'?
<s> Because he is trying to retire me.
<s> Right.
<s> So?
<s> It looks new, they might miss one or two.
<s> I fell in love.
<s> Doug?
<s> No way Doug, I can't.
<s> It's perfect, you've done a great job.
<s> Fuck you!
<s> You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
<s> In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
<s> We're not sure...
<s> Why?
<s> 28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
<s> Go for it.
<s> Don't you?
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> I have expectations, too.
<s> What do you want, Biff?
<s> Not now....
<s> Well... yeah...
<s> Why?
<s> Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
<s> Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
<s> What're you doing?
<s> Well, I got homework.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's mine all right.
<s> There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
<s> I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
<s> It?  Who does?
<s> Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
<s> To get my guns.
<s> No, sir.  I think the flint...
<s> Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
<s> She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
<s> He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
<s> Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
<s> You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
<s> Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
<s> Well I...
<s> Well, you just... sound a little
<s> Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
<s> Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
<s> Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
<s> No.
<s> I know, Nicky, but I like it.
<s> You mean did I write it before my parents died?
<s> No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
<s> I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
<s> Cocaine.
<s> He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
<s> Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
<s> My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
<s> That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
<s> Willie Mays.
<s> They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
<s> I will relay the message.
<s> Maybe you're right.
<s> Had one.  Didn't work.
<s> Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
<s> Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
<s> The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
<s> Too late for what, dear child?
<s> Specify, please.
<s> I hate being lectured.
<s> The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
<s> Then you never loved me?
<s> Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
<s> And you are?
<s> Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
<s> Wait. You can't go.
<s> Slanta.
<s> And now....
<s> I don't want to remember!
<s> Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
<s> Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
<s> Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
<s> How do I know you won't keep them all?
<s> That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
<s> Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
<s> You're one man. You can't save everybody.
<s> Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
<s> Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
<s> What are you, scared of heights?
<s> Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
<s> Great. How??
<s> Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
<s> Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
<s> Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
<s> Heh heh. Yeah.
<s> Huh huh huh.
<s> This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
<s> Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
<s> Not now Bork.
<s> Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
<s> Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
<s> De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
<s> We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
<s> Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
<s> No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
<s> Where'd they go?
<s> That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
<s> My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
<s> Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
<s> ... sheets.
<s> Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
<s> I have no idea...
<s> Yes. I lost my remote control.
<s> Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
<s> Good night, Eve.
<s> Thank you, Eve.
<s> Yes.
<s> I've never ridden in an automobile.
<s> Yes.
<s> Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
<s> I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
<s> Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
<s> Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
<s> There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
<s> What?
<s> Fuck Maxine.
<s> Shut up!
<s> I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
<s> Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
<s> Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
<s> Whatever you're having.
<s> Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
<s> I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
<s> Then what do I do?
<s> If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
<s> What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
<s> That's so.
<s> Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
<s> I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
<s> Make it the way I always do.
<s> Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
<s> He's handicapped, huh?
<s> Are these.
<s> Far from it.
<s> Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
<s> Does the Pope shit in the woods?
<s> Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
<s> Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
<s> Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
<s> And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
<s> Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
<s> WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
<s> Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
<s> It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
<s> You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
<s> Am I wrong!?
<s> We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
<s> Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
<s> He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
<s> It worked, didn't it?
<s> He will.
<s> There's only one alternative to the serum.
<s> Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
<s> Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
<s> That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
<s> Get away from him!
<s> What?
<s> I want to see the tapes.
<s> Well, please keep me fucking informed!
<s> Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
<s> Ask me what I don't have.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Next time try putting on shoes--
<s> --I don't know.
<s> --I saw what I saw.
<s> --Domini!
<s> No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
<s> Does she, goddamnit??
<s> No.
<s> I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
<s> Ever durned one.
<s> Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
<s> Jeffrey.
<s> Sometimes I think I do.
<s> Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
<s> No.  Hi baby.
<s> He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
<s> Here's to Ben.
<s> I don't know. he moved away.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
<s> That sounds good.
<s> Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
<s> Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> It's good to see you, Dad.
<s> This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
<s> You'll see for yourself.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
<s> You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
<s> And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
<s> Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
<s> Okay.
<s> Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
<s> You fucked me, Diego.
<s> Dad.
<s> That's where you belong...
<s> Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
<s> Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
<s> Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
<s> Who speaks Spanish?
<s> Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
<s> Here?
<s> Why?
<s> The official cause?
<s> I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
<s> That's all Dr. Paley.
<s> Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
<s> A.M -- or P.M.?
<s> No!  Why would I want to kill him?
<s> Then you would have gotten your money?
<s> What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
<s> There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
<s> I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
<s> It's not my taste.
<s> What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
<s> Really?
<s> No.
<s> You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
<s> I said NO!
<s> How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
<s> You want me to call the doctor?
<s> Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
<s> Want another cigarette?
<s> Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> I want you to come.
<s> He yours, sir?
<s> How did you get in here?
<s> Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
<s> Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
<s> Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
<s> No.
<s> Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
<s> Where, then?
<s> I should have let him kill you.
<s> Five.
<s> Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
<s> No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
<s> No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> He was in love with you, right?
<s> ...  shit.
<s> Waiting in the apartment next door.
<s> It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
<s> Don't be sorry.  Help me.
<s> You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
<s> Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
<s> 
<s> That's the only angle.
<s> Where am I?
<s> Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> Shut up!
<s> Where are you taking me?
<s> Mistake?
<s> We'll be back.
<s> What is this?  Who the hell are you?
<s> Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
<s> John, play the Sinatra.
<s> Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
<s> We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
<s> I quit! I'm through!
<s> I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
<s> Better bring it all.
<s> What do you want to break?
<s> Used to be my partner.
<s> And the rule was...
<s> In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
<s> Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
<s> Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
<s> Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
<s> Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
<s> Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
<s> I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
<s> I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
<s> Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
<s> It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
<s> I know, man.
<s> What, Mr. De Santis?
<s> I can't talk right now.
<s> Uh, sure.
<s> Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
<s> Turn around!
<s> We hate you guys!
<s> Nice ensemble!
<s> Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
<s> Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
<s> I guess.
<s> Okay.
<s> You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
<s> You can learn to like it.
<s> Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
<s> Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
<s> I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
<s> You spit on me!
<s> I won't have to.
<s> C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
<s> Hold on a second.
<s> Speeding?
<s> 702 472 1862.
<s> Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
<s> I don't wanna come along with you.
<s> You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
<s> Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
<s> No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
<s> How do you do?
<s> All right, we're clear.
<s> Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
<s> I'm not crying. 
<s> He wanted a watch, too.
<s> You're not takin' Amy.
<s> Let me in the house! Fucker!
<s> Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
<s> That's not a problem, that's not a p-
<s> Hey!
<s> Okay.
<s> But I'm just trying to leave.
<s> I know.
<s> I'll be there.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> All right. Be careful.
<s> Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
<s> What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
<s> Angelo and Buster.
<s> No, no, no, no!
<s> You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
<s> Why am I still troubled...
<s> What did you say?
<s> And...your point?
<s> "A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
<s> What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
<s> With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
<s> Not this minute.
<s> Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
<s> A woman?
<s> I'm about ten blocks from the school.
<s> Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
<s> Why can't it be her?
<s> I thought it was inspired.
<s> He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
<s> It's your call.
<s> Let her tell you.
<s> Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
<s> Hi.
<s> Charming.
<s> I'm wondering why you keep his things.
<s> A little.
<s> You gonna tell me why?
<s> A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
<s> It's my name, Dil --
<s> I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
<s> The Metro.
<s> Stop it, Dil --
<s> How different?
<s> 'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
<s> My special friend.
<s> But you fellas never get a break, do you?
<s> Why?
<s> Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
<s> Look.
<s> His -- real -- ?
<s> Thanks very much.
<s> Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
<s> Agents.
<s> The last one, please.
<s> Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
<s> Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
<s> Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
<s> Maybe.
<s> I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
<s> How much is it worth?
<s> Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
<s> That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
<s> No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
<s> Not unless we're blind.
<s> Tell me what?
<s> That's all.
<s> No.
<s> What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
<s> You never went, uh, all the way?
<s> FINE. Are you?
<s> What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
<s> Oh, man.
<s> I did not steal this truck!
<s> Okay, okay! 
<s>  No...
<s> ...you.
<s> I'm crazy?
<s>  It says forty- nine.
<s> 
<s> 
<s> 
<s> Who had to put a gun to your head?
<s> Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
<s>   Hey, actually...
<s> There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
<s> Almost quaint.
<s> So far, ye-yes.
<s> ...screwup?
<s> I assume you want that to go.
<s> ...deer.
<s> Get ready to take it out!
<s> Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
<s> INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
<s> Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
<s> Okay, you got yourself a boat.
<s> You're welcome to try. There he is.
<s> Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
<s> What pictures?
<s> The Valley?
<s> ...A flaw...
<s> Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
<s> Sure.
<s> What the hell is this all about?
<s> Katherine.
<s> What'd you expect? That's his job.
<s> When did you come in?
<s> I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
<s> Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
<s> He was expecting you?
<s> No, you have a press agent do it.
<s> Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
<s> Where is he?
<s> Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
<s> Don't I always?  Most of the time?
<s> How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
<s> You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
<s> No.  But you're close.
<s> Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
<s> You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
<s> Can't say, sir.
<s> Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
<s> We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
<s> No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
<s> So you're really getting married?
<s> And you came here to what? To comfort me?
<s> But you were.
<s> This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
<s> Lenin's Tomb.
<s> You called Caitlin again?
<s> You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
<s> You know what I just watched?
<s> Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
<s> At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
<s> I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
<s> We're not playing in the street.
<s> Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
<s> Bible truth.
<s> No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
<s> Five hundred dollars.
<s> I'm not. She just left.
<s> She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
<s> This is my way of spitting water at life.
<s> While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
<s> I should start.
<s> I don't know. I wasn't watching.
<s> Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
<s> Why? You wanna have sex or something?
<s> After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> That's because I never had sex with him!
<s> Please calm down.
<s> At least he wasn't thirty-six.
<s> The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
<s> I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
<s> Can't do it.
<s> Of course I do.
<s> Where's the rest of the team?
<s> No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
<s> Try the wine!
<s> No. She's dead!
<s> Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
<s> Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Right. The mothballs, Mister.
<s> Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
<s> No, no, <u>wait</u>...
<s> What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
<s> It's not that kind of job.
<s> I tried it.
<s> I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
<s> How can you kill him like that?
<s> I don't understand...
<s> I listen to classical.
<s> No.
<s> That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
<s> Switch the charts.
<s> Who?
<s> To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
<s> Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
<s> What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
<s> Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
<s> What?  Why?
<s> It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
<s> Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
<s> I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
<s> Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
<s> Recommendations?
<s> Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
<s> She's got him! You hear that?
<s> Pair'a nines.
<s> One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
<s> One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
<s> They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
<s> Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
<s> Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
<s> Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
<s> I'd like to go back. James...
<s> A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
<s> Break up?    They wish.
<s> No, I need some serious household advice.
<s> I better make a list.
<s> I like it.     But Headlines are better.
<s> Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
<s> -- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
<s> Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
<s> I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
<s> Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
<s> If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
<s> 
<s> It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
<s> Stick around and find out.
<s> If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
<s> She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
<s> Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
<s> I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
<s> I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
<s> This is a delicate matter.
<s> Don't thank me.
<s> Fine with me.
<s> Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
<s> Really? I thought he said it all the time.
<s> Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
<s> Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
<s> Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
<s> Well did you like it?
<s> Of course. I'm not a monster.
<s> Pretty sure or sure sure?
<s> I'll be in touch.
<s> So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
<s> Cecile.
<s> Yippy.
<s> Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
<s> Come again?
<s> It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
<s> Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
<s> I'm never unfair.
<s> But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
<s> But...
<s> Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
<s> But she's such a nice lady.
<s> Yes...yes, that's true.
<s> But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
<s> What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
<s> At Victoria's Secret.
<s> Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
<s> Okay, I gotta go.
<s> I didn't have to pee then.
<s> I can't help it, it smells so good.
<s> I love you too.
<s> Looks like you need a haircut to me.
<s> The other one?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Just like that?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
<s> That's what people keep telling me.
<s> I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
<s> Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
<s> Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
<s> Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
<s> TilT we figure something out.
<s> Up and around?  Soon?
<s> Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
<s> I don't think so.
<s> All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
<s> No... They don't kid.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
<s> That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
<s> Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
<s> Yes... sir.
<s> I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
<s> All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
<s> Good luck.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Oh. 
<s> Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
<s> Boat or no boat...I'm going...
<s> That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
<s> I have been.
<s> Yeah, Sal--
<s> You're full of shit!
<s> So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
<s> In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
<s> But I insist.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah?
<s> What?
<s> You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
<s> It's ahead, Vince.
<s> Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
<s> Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
<s> Drop it.
<s> Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
<s> <u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hi.
<s> Lying to you -- Why should I?
<s> I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
<s> No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
<s> Belle.
<s> Well, I'll be -- 
<s> That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
<s> Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
<s> Mary!
<s> Hard luck -- like me.
<s> Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
<s> You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
<s> It's okay, it's okay.
<s> Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
<s> Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
<s> We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
<s> I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
<s> I'm really shakey.
<s> You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
<s> But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
<s> You don't have a choice?
<s> Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
<s> Fuck him - let him out!
<s> It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
<s> Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
<s> Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
<s> Have you noticed something about them?
<s> And?
<s> I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
<s> Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
<s> OK.  OK.
<s> To get my money.
<s> HATE!
<s> Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
<s> Sounds like a pirate.
<s> A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
<s> Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
<s> You have beautiful eyes.
<s> Me, me, me!
<s> That's gross.
<s> Hey can be on top?
<s> Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
<s> You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
<s> SILENCE!
<s> Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
<s> Nah.  This happens all the time...
<s> I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
<s> No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
<s> This is my way of telling you --
<s> Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
<s> I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
<s> Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
<s> Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
<s> There's still a sex-change --
<s> Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
<s> We're falling behind.
<s> Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
<s> Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
<s> Oh my God!
<s> Could've been a nurse?
<s> Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
<s> Ohh...
<s> The what?
<s> It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
<s> What are you drunk?
<s> Sure.
<s> That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
<s> You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
<s> Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
<s> I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
<s> Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
<s> You fuck for money.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Until he gunned down six people.
<s> I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
<s> Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
<s> What's her name?
<s> You're the first person to ever call me tough.
<s> None.  Call it a hunch.
<s> Is she?
<s> And Reynolds?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nothing.
<s> <u>Here</u>?!
<s> Not that I could see.
<s> A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
<s> My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
<s> Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
<s> Oh, well, that's true.
<s> Really?
<s> They only took electrical appliances.
<s> Sir--
<s> What about the tape?
<s> Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
<s> We've got to get you out of here.
<s> I haven't, no.  Sorry.
<s> Ask him.
<s> Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
<s> Me?
<s> Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
<s> I've met you before.
<s> You get Hardy.
<s> Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
<s> Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
<s> Why not?
<s> What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
<s> Why didn't I think of that?
<s> Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
<s> We're only going one way.
<s> He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
<s> What?
<s> You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
<s> Where the money is.
<s> The disc is still in there.
<s> What, you think I'm made of money?
<s> Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
<s> Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
<s> Yesterday.
<s> At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
<s> Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
<s> Thanks for reminding me.
<s> One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
<s> Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
<s> Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
<s> You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
<s> You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
<s> They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
<s> Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
<s> Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
<s> Oh my, no!
<s> They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
<s> Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
<s> C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
<s> I got a new deal for you.
<s> Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
<s> But not from your destiny.
<s> Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
<s> I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
<s> Please.
<s> You could do it yourself...
<s> Not at all. Why d'you ask?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Well you know it's okay.
<s> And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
<s> Amen
<s> Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
<s> How's the birthday girl?
<s> Twenty-eight years, Frank.
<s> Bosen black.  Flat.
<s> That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
<s> No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
<s> Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Hey!
<s> All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
<s> As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
<s> Baker.
<s> Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
<s> Every year.
<s> He called her.
<s> Oh.
<s> I didn't want to wake you.
<s> Good to see you, Ma.
<s> Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
<s> Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
<s> The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
<s> You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
<s> Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
<s> No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
<s> Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
<s> I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
<s> It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
<s> What the hell is happening to me?!
<s> Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
<s> Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
<s> Its lovely...
<s> I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
<s> Are you okay, Jack?
<s> Of course I did.
<s> Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
<s> I like the sound of that.
<s> External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
<s> Is it safe?
<s> And they're changing into...
<s> The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
<s> What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
<s> Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
<s> Showtime.
<s> Of course.  Of course.
<s> No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
<s> A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
<s> That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
<s> We're pushing oxygen today.
<s> You may learn to like it.
<s> Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
<s> Quite a piece of plumbing.
<s> No, there's no other way.
<s> I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
<s> Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
<s> What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
<s> The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
<s> Personal matters.
<s> Ya got that right.
<s> Know who this is?
<s> No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
<s> Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
<s> Yah, woulda been cold out here.
<s> No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
<s> Yah.
<s> When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
<s> What?
<s> You haven't been going to yours.
<s> Hear what?
<s> The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
<s> Tyler Durden.
<s> Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
<s> What... what are you saying?
<s> I think this is about where we came in.
<s> Why are you doing this?!
<s> It's free to all.
<s> Don't sweat it.  It's over.
<s> Maybe.  What's this about?
<s> There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
<s> Clean up?  I don't...
<s> How do you know?
<s> You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
<s> There's the Mekong.
<s> Nothing we can do, man.
<s> Colonel.
<s> The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
<s> And who's Lydia?
<s> I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
<s> No...  He is supposed to live there?
<s> I'm... just looking for Parry...
<s> NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
<s> Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
<s> No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
<s> "OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
<s> Parry... I'm Jack.
<s> I don't know.
<s> <u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
<s> <u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
<s> BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
<s> Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
<s> Out where?
<s> Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
<s> I hope they do.
<s> You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
<s> I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
<s> That's good.
<s> I don't think that's accurate...
<s> At game, Carl.
<s> I ought to get some sleep.
<s> Not luck. They don't want me.
<s> It was planted on me, sir.
<s> Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
<s> What?
<s> Gum thought Brazil.
<s> I'd have been long gone.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
<s> Get me on the first shot, if you can.
<s> Cute thing.
<s> It's amazing.
<s> I think you should call me Gail, now.
<s> Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
<s> Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
<s> Johnny's C.D.?
<s> Go on, another time, another place.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Mmm.
<s> Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
<s> Nothing in there except a New York street map.
<s> You didn't marry Donna Reed.
<s> It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
<s> Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
<s> Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
<s> Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
<s> Wait...
<s> No.
<s> I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
<s> I hear that.
<s> I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
<s> That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
<s> Why?
<s> Sheriff, you better take this.
<s> My ass.
<s> I think somebody's messin' around out there.
<s> There's no time for this bullshit...
<s> Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
<s> How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
<s> -- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
<s> I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
<s> I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
<s> It's...dead.
<s> Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
<s> Hi, Sean.
<s> What did you find?
<s> What do you mean, we must abandon?
<s> Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
<s> Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
<s> Do not inhale.
<s> What was it like?
<s> Why do you need a radio?
<s> I have a class. I'm late.
<s> That's very lovely actually.
<s> You're hurting my head.
<s> Matthew's my grandson.
<s> "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
<s> Well, we shall try.
<s> "Hell!"
<s> My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
<s> Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
<s> Now is your chance to find out.
<s> You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
<s> It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
<s> We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
<s> They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
<s> You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
<s> I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't want to hear it.
<s> Thanks. Hope you do too.
<s> What about you?
<s> It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
<s> 'Good.'
<s> Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
<s> What?
<s> Why?
<s> I can't Jack. How can I?
<s> No.
<s> Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
<s> That's nice. What'd you tell him?
<s> No. Really, I am.
<s> And you should know, if I remember rightly.
<s> They'll know when you go over to Graff...
<s> I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
<s> You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
<s> ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
<s> "...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
<s> Last night, this morning.
<s> Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
<s> No, where is it?
<s>  You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
<s> It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
<s> You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
<s> Mike wants it.
<s> We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
<s> The witness is excused; take him out.
<s> No, I'm fine.
<s> I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
<s> You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
<s> The Master is waiting for you.
<s> That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
<s> A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
<s> Huh?
<s> Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
<s> Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
<s> I see.
<s> What did you expect?  Bronze?
<s> You'll feel better tomorrow.
<s> You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
<s> How ya doing?
<s> You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
<s> You, too, Ma...
<s> Just hold on... Hold on ...
<s> Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
<s> Me.
<s> I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
<s> I take out my slim-jim...
<s> Not --
<s> Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
<s> Nods again.
<s> I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
<s> He's okay. They sobered him up.
<s> Oh shit.
<s> An integer.
<s> Find out what?
<s> I think so.
<s> Now wait a minute--
<s> Never been.
<s> I did.
<s> Nautilus?
<s> I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
<s> In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
<s> Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
<s> Watch me pass that Chevvy.
<s> Naw. They paroled me.
<s> If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
<s> Didn' you have no breakfast?
<s> On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
<s> I could hide you, Tommy.
<s> Whatsa matter?
<s> It's what I do.
<s> Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
<s> I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
<s> -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
<s> Work's good for the soul.
<s> Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
<s> It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
<s> Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
<s> Don't they believe in signs here?
<s> Did you go riding?
<s> All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
<s> No.
<s> About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
<s> Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
<s> You want to take a walk with me?
<s> That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
<s> Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
<s> I'm sorry. Who are you?
<s> Yeah! Sure.
<s> Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
<s> Nonono, thank YOU!
<s> We've been better.
<s> She's not dead!
<s> Get back!
<s> Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
<s> You ready for some Ice Cream?
<s> The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
<s> Of course.
<s> He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
<s> Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
<s> You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
<s> You want to see some?
<s> Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
<s> Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
<s> Ohhhh!
<s> Not because of me, I hope.
<s> I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
<s> What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Because he likes you.
<s> Oh...
<s> Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
<s> No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
<s> Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
<s> I think so.
<s> H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
<s> Wow!
<s> Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
<s> Oh, who cares?
<s> You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
<s> You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
<s> <u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
<s> Or, perhaps...
<s> We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
<s> Rich, comic book freaks.
<s> You spend the afternoon in Bed?
<s> He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
<s> Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
<s> That could be.
<s> How so?
<s> And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
<s> That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
<s> Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
<s> I'm not a nai-ive little...
<s> I just never thought of you in that...
<s> In my heart, Heather's still alive.
<s> I'll think about it.
<s> Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
<s> No.
<s> Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
<s> Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
<s> Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
<s> Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
<s> Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
<s> Shut the fuck up, all right.
<s> You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
<s> I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
<s> I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
<s> It's so beautiful!
<s> Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
<s> I need my sodding parents' consent.
<s> I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
<s> I understand, I think. Other women?
<s> No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
<s> I don't work here.
<s> I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
<s> What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
<s> Right.
<s> He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
<s> Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
<s> Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
<s> You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
<s> Said he's not an actor.
<s> So this really does the trick, eh?
<s> A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
<s> You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
<s> Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
<s> Sure.
<s> Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
<s> That's okay, Mom.
<s> Huh?
<s> <u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
<s> Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
<s> What about cable?
<s> Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
<s> I learned my fill from Romeriz.
<s> How long is the voyage?
<s> I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
<s> Aye.
<s> Then how did he know your name?
<s> I was working on the cataloging.
<s> No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
<s> The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
<s> Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
<s> That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
<s> How about the cop?
<s> I'm here.
<s> Keeps to himself, more like.
<s> Okey-doke.
<s> You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
<s> He said something about a girl --
<s> Go, Mickey.
<s> Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
<s> Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
<s> And what will they do with these satellites?
<s> Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
<s> Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
<s> He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
<s> I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
<s> Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
<s> Better living through electricity.
<s> It's succeeding!
<s> You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
<s> It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
<s> If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
<s> You'll have to settle for turkey.
<s> Right.  Right!
<s> Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
<s> Taken what?
<s> That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
<s> I don't know.  Maybe.
<s> Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
<s> Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
<s> Employer?  The president?
<s> Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
<s> Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
<s> Now, Aim --
<s> Says who?!
<s> Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
<s> I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
<s> Yeah, tell me about it.
<s> The mark notices.
<s> I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
<s> That's rather nice, isn't it?
<s> We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
<s> Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
<s> Did you hear what he sang?
<s> Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
<s> Why?
<s> Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
<s> Paul? Yeah. You think --
<s> Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
<s> Nothing.
<s> -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
<s> Huh?
<s> But there wasn't any...
<s> I don't remember.
<s> That's what I said.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then there is nothing.
<s> What night? What do you mean?
<s> You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
<s> It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
<s> No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Fascination...
<s> I can't.
<s> I don't know any hell -
<s> But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
<s> Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
<s> If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
<s> No.
<s> I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
<s> No, I'm the King of the World.
<s> I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
<s> I've got to see.
<s> Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
<s> I'm right here. Grab my hand.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Yes?
<s> I don't understand you.
<s> Hero?
<s> There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
<s> But that should make you like her.
<s> You see? Thea believes it, too!
<s> Then foreclose!
<s> All right  all right.
<s> Made what?
<s> You're nobody. You have no identity.
<s> That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
<s> Well, what happened to you?
<s> Hello, Vi.
<s> I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
<s> Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
<s> Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
<s> I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
<s> What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
<s> No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
<s> Honey, I gotta go.
<s> ... Mean through the tubes?
<s> Only to myself.
<s> Afraid I can't do that.
<s> They still seem nervous.
<s> Better than catching Sean's herpes.
<s> Come on!  Check this out!
<s> And alone.
<s> This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
<s> We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
<s> Mommy lets me....
<s> He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
<s> I am.
<s> Good.
<s> I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
<s> You didn't stick them on right....
<s> Stop busting my hump....
<s> What?
<s> When we got the grant....
<s> Here comes the cow ca-ca....
<s> Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
<s> I don't know.
<s> They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
<s> Yeah, what happened there.
<s> Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
<s> Of course I know --
<s> -- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
<s> Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
<s> We still having dinner in L.A.?
<s> A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
<s> You okay?
<s> -- and I'll get 'em.
<s> Nothing you haven't seen before.
<s> I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
<s> Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
<s> Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
<s> To collect my fee.
<s> Piss.
<s> No way.
<s> What's that?
<s> John....
<s> They smell.
<s> I know.
<s> I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
<s> Why not?
<s> Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
<s> I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
<s> I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
<s> What?
<s> Because everyone knows he's guilty...
<s> Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
<s> None of that's true?
<s> It was Krueger, wasn't it?
<s> How's that possible?
<s> Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
<s> Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
<s> Another one?
<s> I -- I found your jailer.
<s> Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
<s> I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
<s> Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
<s> I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
<s> Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
<s> Well --
<s> Yeah, you got to me.
<s> About what?
<s> Well there's a couple --
<s> He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
<s> Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
<s> I love you...
<s> Do you have a lover now?
<s> Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
<s> You want what?!
<s> Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
<s> Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
<s> You and Charley?
<s> A moment.
<s> Kham, Holiness.
<s> Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
<s> Time to study.
<s> The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
<s> But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
<s> It happens when I land.
<s> Mr. Cyr!
<s> I coulda shot you, you--
<s> You talk to Bickerman?
<s> I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
<s> He's floating.  Take it home.
<s> No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
<s> Is the dead guy in there?
<s> It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
<s> Thanks.
<s> He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
<s> I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
<s> Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
<s> Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
<s> Then please - do this test for me.
<s> After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
<s> You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
<s> Why did they turn back?
<s> Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
<s> No.
<s> That's all, sir.
<s> Yes.
<s> These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
<s> He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
<s> After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
<s> Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
<s> Like a leech.
<s> Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
<s> I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
<s> Furry muff, let's go.
<s> . . . What?
<s> No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
<s> From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
<s> Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
<s> I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
<s> --but just as a kind of safety tip.
<s> We was crossin' the river--
<s> '57, 1 believe--
<s> We don't need a new jail.
<s> I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
<s> And I understand why you might want to think he could.
<s> Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
<s> He hates me.
<s> You've got your mother, your kids--
<s> I'm going over to the other side.
<s> I told you --
<s> What is he?
<s> Yes.
<s> Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
<s> I just saw him.
<s> Yes.
<s> What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
<s> Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
<s> No, how about you?
<s> I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
<s> One moment, please.
<s> I gotta go to work.
<s> And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
<s> On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
<s> I know who he is.
<s> Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
<s> Dad around?
<s> How'd you get him to say yes?
<s> Chances are there's still a chance.
<s> Just wanted to say good game.
<s> No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
<s> Here I am.
<s> No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
<s> Yup.
<s> Kiss my ass.
<s> A rest?
<s> It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
<s> Hey.
<s> Okay.
<s> What mess?
<s> I'm here, I'm listening.
<s> Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
<s> Thank you.  Thank you very much.
<s> What's that stand for?
<s> What?
<s> yeah, yes, hi, hello.
<s> What happend?
<s> Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
<s> I've seen it before.
<s> I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
<s> I went out last night.
<s> Well maybe.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
<s> PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
<s> That's it.
<s> Shut up -- shut up --
<s> Stand up.
<s> Come on...
<s> I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
<s> There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
<s> I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
<s> If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
<s> Where are you?
<s> Who is it?
<s> I'm not going anywhere!
<s> If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
<s> Why?
<s> Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
<s> Let's get to the physical.
<s> You'll come by?
<s> Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
<s> What's average?
<s> Hey, baby! Where are you?
<s> I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
<s> Are you George Sherman?
<s> Fight what?
<s> You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
<s> Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
<s> Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
<s> Hi... am I late?
<s> Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
<s> Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
<s> I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
<s> I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
<s> My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
<s> No!
<s> I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
<s> I'm going in after him.
<s> No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
<s> What do they want?
<s> Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
<s> Ok.  Wait here.
<s> Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
<s> Didn't show up.
<s> How?
<s> Don't be smart.
<s> Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
<s> It's for the party, Dad --
<s> Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
<s> What'd it say?
<s> 'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
<s> Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
<s> This universe?
<s> Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
<s> Yes, I believe I do.
<s> Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
<s> I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
<s> Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
<s> Seen you together, that's all.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Strip!
<s> Take the money and walk away!
<s> Sorry.
<s> Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
<s> How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
<s> From who?
<s> Why would I have a gun?
<s> Okay.  You got the "item"?
<s> Okay.
<s> Really?
<s> I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
<s> And what do I do with him?
<s> And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
<s> And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
<s> Sonny...?
<s> Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
<s> Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
<s> What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
<s> Gin's okay.
<s> What?
<s> Sure.
<s> Work, work, work, that's all do
<s> Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
<s> That's it?
<s> I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
<s> I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
<s> What is it?
<s> I know how that can be.
<s> Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
<s> Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
<s> In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
<s> Hugh, I'm impressed..
<s> You can be a thief and have a conscience.
<s> I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
<s> Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
<s> You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
<s> You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
<s> Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
<s> If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
<s> Its not working.
<s> Yes.
<s> What killed him?
<s> It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
<s> No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
<s> She was too young for him.
<s> Alright.
<s> Well. I don't really know where to start.
<s> Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
<s> You don't vote for kings.
<s> 'Tis but a scratch.
<s> Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
<s> Yes.
<s> Come on, patsy.
<s> He hasn't got shit all over him.
<s> Listen, Alice ...
<s> I was saved at the last minute.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> You know what I mean.
<s> Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
<s> A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
<s> In time, she will.
<s> I am.
<s> You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
<s> I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> It's the game, ARCADE.
<s> Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
<s> It's already out.
<s> What?
<s> What?!  There's nothing here!
<s> Screamer.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
<s> But you won't.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
<s> What's going on ?
<s> I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
<s> Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
<s> RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
<s> Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
<s> What ?????
<s> I can see that but where ?
<s> Excuse me, gentlemen
<s> Shut up ! It's me.
<s> We made it !
<s> Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
<s> Pommeroy.
<s> Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
<s> Does she?
<s> You are?
<s> No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
<s> Hi.
<s> I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
<s> Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
<s> Phil for God sake.
<s> What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
<s> Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
<s> Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
<s> Yeah, all right...
<s> This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, sweetie, not yet.
<s> I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
<s> Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
<s> Oh.
<s> I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
<s> HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
<s> But I have my clothes on!
<s> It is not.
<s> Desperate.  To talk.
<s> I've missed a step.
<s> Nobody has.  So far.
<s> She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
<s> No.  I've got you.
<s> It's more than that.
<s> No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
<s> To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
<s> ... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
<s> Is there food?
<s> Okay.
<s> Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
<s> Your wire Ester - she passed away.
<s> Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
<s> Nash.
<s> About three years.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
<s> Might be good for you.
<s> You bet.
<s> Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
<s> Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
<s> Susanville, Soledade.
<s> She was born without a tongue.
<s> Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
<s> Slate it.
<s> What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
<s> That's right.
<s> I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
<s> Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
<s> I doubt it.
<s> I guess I'll rob a bank.
<s> It's for your own good.
<s> You hate Raoul?
<s> I an' I, man. I an' I.
<s> What?
<s> Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
<s> Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
<s> YOU KNIT?
<s> Betty.
<s> A flack jacket.
<s> Dude, you rock!
<s> Thanks. And what are -
<s> <i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
<s> No.
<s> He's conducting experiments of his own.
<s> It's not the gas, Dad!
<s> Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
<s> Who?
<s> 'Morning, honey.
<s> We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
<s> Fuck off.
<s> Thanks, Max.
<s> With Hypnocyl?
<s> There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
<s> A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
<s> The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
<s> There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
<s> Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
<s> Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
<s> How do you think I'm doing?
<s> Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
<s> What's the thing?
<s> Yes.
<s> Right. 
<s> How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
<s> She's perfect, perfect.
<s> No -- you're right.
<s> Yes.
<s> Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
<s> Please see to Mister Bromden.
<s> W-W-Where we g-g-going?
<s> No.
<s> That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
<s> Hey, what's that?
<s> I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
<s> I just started!
<s> McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
<s> Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
<s> I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
<s> To help you relax... please...
<s> After you, ma'am.
<s> Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
<s> It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
<s> I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
<s> Let's find a telephone.
<s> Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
<s> Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
<s> Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
<s> Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
<s> I know...  It was.
<s> I know.  You're right.
<s> You're coming with me?
<s> You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
<s> So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
<s> A little bad luck?
<s> So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
<s> What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
<s> Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
<s> What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
<s> What do you weigh these days, slugger?
<s> How much is your soul worth if you don't?
<s> Wilson yeah  yeah I fought Wilson.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
<s> Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
<s> Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
<s> No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
<s> The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
<s> You mean...!
<s> Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
<s> Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
<s> You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
<s> You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
<s> Aaarrrgggaahh.
<s> He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
<s> He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
<s> Am I going to Detroit by myself?
<s> Sure looks that way.
<s> Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
<s> You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
<s> Those guys bother you?
<s> Any time.
<s> A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
<s> The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
<s> I <i>was</i>...
<s> I told you, he isn't here.
<s> Likewise.
<s> Still...
<s> Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
<s> You mean hiding them?
<s> You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
<s> I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
<s> Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
<s> We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
<s> God help them.
<s> I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
<s> How do you like my hair?
<s> Charlie...
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Why wait?
<s> Of course.
<s> Oh, God, Dion.
<s> My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
<s> It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
<s> Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
<s> What was?
<s> Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
<s> Wait! I'll go with you!
<s> --Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
<s> Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
<s> Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
<s> Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
<s> You think he'd believe it if he did?
<s> One hour!
<s> Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
<s> Ready for what, baby?
<s> Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
<s> I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
<s> It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
<s> You could have infected him, isn't that right?
<s> You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
<s> How did you do that?
<s> Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
<s> Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
<s> ... It's time to get this society back on track!
<s> Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
<s> He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
<s> 'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
<s> For now.
<s> I would rather we all stay--
<s> I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
<s> He will be with us. Nonetheless.
<s> They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
<s> Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
<s> Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
<s> What are you doing there?
<s> Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
<s> Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
<s> Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
<s> What?
<s> Then what do you suggest big shot?
<s> Barnes believes in what he's doing.
<s> Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
<s> Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
<s> He dugged his own grave.
<s> These two holes are yours...
<s> I'm supposing.
<s> I'm sure you have.
<s> Maybe you're going to have to like me.
<s> He got in here how?
<s> On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
<s> So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
<s> You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
<s> I don't want to talk.
<s> I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
<s> I've got good ears.
<s> You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
<s> Such as?
<s> He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
<s> I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
<s> When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
<s> What does it look like?
<s> What went wrong?
<s> Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
<s> Let me see.
<s> Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
<s> Darling Susan.
<s> I won't.  Goodnight.
<s> Once.
<s> Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
<s> Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
<s> Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
<s> The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
<s> Shrimp and fries.
<s> This gets better by the minute.
<s> Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
<s> Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
<s> Rent.  You're late.
<s> Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
<s> Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
<s> Not yet.
<s> -- power too -- promise me that --
<s> Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
<s> For the Princess?
<s> Congratulations.
<s> You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
<s> I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
<s> Right.
<s> What???
<s> Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
<s> You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
<s> I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
<s> I mean in show business.
<s> Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
<s> I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
<s> Cash or check? For the cabin...
<s> Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
<s> I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
<s> Huh?
<s> First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
<s> Sam!
<s> To a private island, like you?
<s> I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
<s> No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
<s> Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
<s> How? What can I do?
<s> Now don't that call for an extra!
<s> No foolin' -- any suspect?
<s> He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
<s> I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
<s> Good night, sir.
<s> Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
<s> It's an experiment.
<s> Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
<s> It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
<s> Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
<s> I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
<s> Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
<s> Well, I have a pretty good idea.
<s> Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
<s> Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
<s> Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
<s> We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
<s> It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
<s> It's go time, Billy-B.
<s> What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
<s> You know... you could say thank you.
<s> No you're not.
<s> I know it is, even if you don't.
<s> Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
<s> Let's see.
<s> And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
<s> Like I'm outside in the rain
<s> ...Goodnight, Rocky.
<s> I don't think I belong here.
<s> Don't tease me.
<s> Don't want weak legs.
<s> Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
<s> Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
<s> He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
<s> Do I have to pay juice?
<s> What?
<s> Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
<s> You think everybody I fight is a bum.
<s> Turtles -- domestic turtles.
<s> See what?
<s> What can I do about it?
<s> Just because you got 'em to laugh?
<s> A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
<s> Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
<s> Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
<s> Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
<s> Well, what was yours?
<s> Is she a Capulet?
<s> Is that right?
<s> Which leads us to...
<s> It's been known to happen.
<s> I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
<s> Bad company...
<s> And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
<s> Not exactly.
<s> You don't have to do this.
<s> So I do it.
<s> Why not?
<s> I get the picture.
<s> Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
<s> Just take it in stride.
<s> Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
<s> Excellent. I'll go down with you.
<s> Sure.
<s> Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
<s> Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
<s> Those are five hundred dollar chips.
<s> I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
<s> It's your turn!
<s> The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
<s> No.
<s> With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
<s> Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
<s> Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
<s> And what did you say?
<s> Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
<s> I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
<s> I already made an appointment for later today.
<s> This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
<s> Tootaloo.
<s> Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
<s> I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
<s> So what happened?
<s> I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
<s> I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
<s> Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
<s> I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
<s> Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
<s> So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
<s> So much the better.
<s> But it's yours. I won't let them ...
<s> Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
<s> Colette ...
<s> You get off on abuse or something?
<s> Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
<s> You go, boy.
<s> When?
<s> And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
<s> With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
<s> There's no motels around here.
<s> It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
<s> He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
<s> Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
<s> I guess.
<s> Nope, he ain't Wade.
<s> Simpson.
<s> I know.
<s> Sure, Reiben.
<s> That's a mystery to me.
<s> Twenty-four-five.
<s> Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
<s> Hang in there, man.
<s> I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
<s> You're going.
<s> Look at those eyes.
<s> My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
<s> In Breslau.
<s> Yeah, what's that?
<s> I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
<s> Something they can hold in their hands.
<s> Why aren't you there?
<s> Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
<s> It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
<s> Easy black boy.
<s> Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
<s> I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
<s> Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
<s> Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
<s> Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
<s> Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
<s> And who is that?
<s> Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
<s> Oh shit it's my cell!
<s> Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
<s> How do I know their voices are --
<s> Oh Sidney...
<s> Who is this?
<s> Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
<s> To talk.
<s> Sure...
<s> Answer the question and I will.
<s> I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
<s> Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
<s> Working, thank you.
<s> We had a run in the mass murder section.
<s> Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
<s> What am I? The beer wench?
<s> I'll see you.
<s> Hello.
<s> What the fuck is going on here?!
<s> I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
<s> Please be quiet for a while, would you?
<s> What?
<s> I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
<s> Punishing.
<s> We need a warrant.
<s> People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
<s> Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
<s> All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
<s> Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
<s> You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
<s> Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
<s> Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
<s> My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
<s> Hi, darling.
<s> ...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
<s> We should leave the past alone.
<s> Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
<s> A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
<s> Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
<s> There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
<s> My lord.
<s> So my lord? I speak with him every day.
<s> I will do my duty, my lord.
<s> Then what? Who's going to do what?
<s> You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
<s> You're sure? There's lots more.
<s> Cameron?
<s> Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
<s> Who was it?
<s> Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
<s> OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
<s> Eh --
<s> What happened to that guy?
<s> That's what I thought.
<s> I mean, that's what it's like.
<s> Yes, sweetheart, shh.
<s> And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
<s> You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
<s> Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
<s> Did Lester know about him?
<s> -- oh I thought you were --
<s> What's gonna happen?
<s> Where's your car?
<s> Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
<s> I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
<s> I see.
<s> When?
<s> Isn't that bad for it?
<s> Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
<s> They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
<s> Aren't you going to have one?
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
<s> You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
<s> It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
<s> Rats...
<s> No.
<s> What the hell does that matter?
<s> Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
<s> 'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
<s> And you listen to that?
<s> Today was the deadline, Vince.
<s> But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
<s> Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
<s> Amateurs 2
<s> You know?  About me?  About everything?
<s> I... I brought you something.
<s> Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
<s> No problem.
<s> Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
<s> At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
<s> I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
<s> They open a window.
<s> And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
<s> Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
<s> She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
<s> A fine idea.
<s> We should go.
<s> Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
<s> The skull is gone.
<s> What would you have me believe?
<s> No, sir, please... she is innocent...
<s> Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
<s> How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
<s> You told me to come by.
<s> Two people.
<s> All right then.
<s> Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
<s> Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
<s> I love you, too, Mama.
<s> Okay.
<s> I know.
<s> Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
<s> I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
<s> It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
<s> Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
<s> Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
<s> And?
<s> It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
<s> I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
<s> An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
<s> No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
<s> Yeah, I can believe it.
<s> Are you going to be all right?
<s> I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
<s> And started to run.
<s> That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
<s> Good. I'm glad that's settled!
<s> No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
<s> Well, what if?
<s> Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
<s> Those aren't the facts that matter.
<s> You're wondering why I held it.
<s> Maybe...?
<s> I think you like learning.
<s> Manhattans?  This time of night?
<s> Hey, she's ticklish!
<s> Yeah.  Why?
<s> Like right after the ceremony.
<s> So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
<s> Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
<s> Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
<s> So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
<s> I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
<s> If it's at all possible -
<s> What?
<s> Oh, no!
<s> You and who else?
<s> You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
<s> Jeffrey told her last night.
<s> Its my job.
<s> Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
<s> What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
<s> Yes, sir...
<s> You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
<s> I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
<s> I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
<s> What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
<s> Eric!
<s> Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
<s> 'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
<s> Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
<s> Something big, children.
<s> YOU BASTARD!!
<s> Are you sure, Kenny?
<s> YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
<s> And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
<s> Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
<s> I know, Terrance. I know.
<s> Canada is saving us!!
<s> Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
<s> I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
<s> Wendy?
<s> Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> Anna...
<s> Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
<s> You're not from around here, are you?
<s> He's my dad.
<s> Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
<s> Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
<s> Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
<s> I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
<s> What do you want with my dad?
<s> Why not?
<s> Open it, Captain!
<s> Yes, Harry.
<s> He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
<s> Causes sleep.
<s> Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
<s> Don't you?
<s> And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
<s> Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
<s> When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
<s> Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
<s> Who says it's a he?
<s> That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
<s> Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
<s> No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
<s> I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
<s> See?  No code.  What'd I say?
<s> The others, sir?
<s> I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
<s> Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
<s> Did it occur to you they might find us?
<s> Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
<s> He'll be well cared for.
<s> I read you sir.
<s> What an honor...
<s> He was our teacher... He was great.
<s> Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
<s> Excuse me...!
<s> I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
<s> Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
<s> Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
<s> Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
<s> You can never be sure.
<s> This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
<s> Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
<s> Uh, I don't know.
<s> Cover us, Ace !
<s> Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
<s> That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
<s> V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.

<s> I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --

<s> That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
<s> What's it called?
<s> I love your script.
<s> Read the card.
<s> Is it...
<s> It does?
<s> Nothing happened.
<s> We missed you in Church today, Frank.
<s> Everybody needs a hob...
<s> You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
<s> I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
<s> I don't...
<s> Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
<s> Mmm...
<s> I killed her!
<s> Excellent point.
<s> What are you gonna talk about?
<s> Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
<s> ...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
<s> Don't. Take me with you.
<s> You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
<s> How do you know?
<s> You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
<s> Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
<s> Not personally.
<s> Don't flatter yourself.
<s> Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
<s> You're the hip and fresh.
<s> No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
<s> Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
<s> Well, now you have.
<s> ...gger.
<s> Any books you like to read for fun?
<s> That's what I was gonna ask you.
<s> Three.
<s> Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
<s> To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
<s> I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
<s> You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
<s> Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
<s> Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
<s> And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
<s> I think they mean business.
<s> Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
<s> I don't get you, King.
<s> I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
<s> No, no.
<s> Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
<s> No, I mean, no one.
<s> Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
<s> Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
<s> Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
<s> Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
<s> Mm.
<s> About what?
<s> No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
<s> Us.
<s> Yes, you do.
<s> No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
<s> Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
<s> No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
<s> Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
<s> You just became a statistic!
<s> Of course - of course!  Hands in...
<s> That was gas, Sweetie.
<s> Jus some girlie things for the squad.
<s> I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
<s> Let it ride for a while.
<s> Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
<s> I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
<s> I went for a walk.
<s> I'm not here.
<s> She is upstairs.
<s> Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
<s> Frankly, no.
<s> Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
<s> No?
<s> Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
<s> Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
<s> Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
<s> Later.
<s> Yes. It reminds me of home.
<s> Well...I guess one is all right.
<s> Terrific.
<s> Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
<s> It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
<s> Somebody's gotta do something!!
<s> You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
<s> You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
<s> Some people don't think it's healthy.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
<s> Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
<s> In other words, push this red button.
<s> Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
<s> Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
<s> He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
<s> That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
<s> Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
<s> Sentimental idiot.
<s> . . . Let me get my purse.
<s> He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
<s> Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
<s> Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
<s> There!
<s> Destiny.
<s> No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
<s> Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
<s> Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
<s> Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
<s> Okay.  Take me to your leader.
<s> Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
<s> I didn't say a word.
<s> I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
<s> It's not bad.
<s> You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.  It should be dry by now.
<s> For rabbits?
<s> How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
<s> We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
<s> Yes.  It's a present.
<s> Did he say what about?
<s> Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
<s> Is there shrimp on it?
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Great.
<s> Don't apologize for me, Frank!
<s> And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
<s> Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
<s> No, I'm not.  I'm not!
<s> I'll listen one more minute.
<s> Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
<s> I hate to see you like this --
<s> Why not you?
<s> Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
<s> That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
<s> And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
<s> I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
<s> Then what?
<s> I guess it's possible.
<s> Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
<s> I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
<s> Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
<s> This is absolute nonsense!
<s> Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
<s> I won't let the fat kid down.
<s> The what?
<s> I apologized, I offered to help.
<s> Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
<s> Please, don't do that...
<s> My hero.  Let's go.
<s> I thought...
<s> Nicholas...
<s> I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
<s> Big family... small?
<s> I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
<s> Of course, Nick...
<s> Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
<s> Ilsa... you're alright?
<s> Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
<s> It was very specific.
<s> That?  That's Hill House.
<s> Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
<s> Why'd she kill herself?
<s> Sure.
<s> Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
<s> Not much -- you?
<s> Probably.
<s> Hard to miss.
<s> Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
<s> Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
<s> Where else?
<s> And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
<s> You bet.
<s> I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
<s> They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
<s> Who's looking for you?
<s> Be seein' you.
<s> Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
<s> All right, I guess.
<s> Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
<s> The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
<s> Just coffee.
<s> Told what?
<s> How's that?
<s> He and Doris... were having an affair.
<s> Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
<s> I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
<s> That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
<s> That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
<s> Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
<s> Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
<s> Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Saturday?
<s> Are you okay?  You look like shit.
<s> So why do you want to go?
<s> I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
<s> I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
<s> We have a situation. The members are assembling.
<s> What's that?
<s> No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
<s> Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
<s> That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
<s> Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
<s> Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
<s> There's nothing in them.
<s> It wasn't important.
<s> Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
<s> Holly Martins.
<s> Calloway.
<s> Who?
<s> I told the police.
<s> Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
<s> We swim.
<s> Incredible.
<s> Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
<s> 'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
<s> Did you see how they reacted to him?
<s> That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
<s> A poison...?
<s> Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
<s> Get the fuck away from me.
<s> I've got to get back to the --
<s> Who even knew?
<s> Get out of my way.
<s> Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
<s> Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
<s> Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
<s> A rosary for Mama, a dress for
<s> You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
<s> ... You married?
<s> Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
<s> Uh... Ah!  A story?
<s> Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
<s> I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
<s> What about me?
<s> I drink.
<s> Yes?
<s> We're old friends.
<s> What! You can't be --
<s> Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
<s> Have you finished?
<s> You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
<s> Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
<s> B-Black...
<s> Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
<s> We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
<s> Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
<s> The acid bath?
<s> He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
<s> If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
<s> I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
<s> You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
<s> No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
<s> It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
<s> In a village called Domremy.
<s> Not long ago...
<s> And may I go to Mass?
<s> It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
<s> No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
<s> Go and ask him yourself.
<s> Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
<s> The clothes are not important...
<s> You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
<s> Yes... lots of things!
<s> No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
<s> Do you think this cross will protect you?
<s> It's like this... I...we...all of them.
<s> Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
<s> I haven't seen him.
<s> I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
<s> It's a little cut, nothing.
<s> How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
<s> The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
<s> Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
<s> I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
<s> You sober?
<s> Raise 5,000.
<s> Don't think I know him.
<s> We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
<s> Better get home before it is.
<s> Not a thing.
<s> So you say -  Go on, Bob.
<s> He did!
<s> When was that?
<s> That's jolly.
<s> It's the only way it makes sense.
<s> Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
<s> No... no.
<s> I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
<s> Wait.  Wait.
<s> Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
<s> Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
<s> So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
<s> Just stay down.
<s> If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
<s> It's giving.
<s> Forget Wes.
<s> I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
<s> They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
<s> We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
<s> People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
<s> Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
<s> I could.
<s> ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
<s> He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
<s> All right...
<s> She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
<s> Cream of the crop, huh? You?
<s> Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
<s> I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
<s> One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
<s> Security.
<s> Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
<s> What kind of bomb was it?
<s> No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
<s> I thought I told you--
<s> Amsterdam?
<s> At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
<s> Oh! You didn't read it!
<s> Too much blue in crimson.
<s> Peaches and cream.
<s> Do you realize I have light eyes?
<s> And so will M'sieu Giron.
<s> So you think you can get me?
<s> I <u>must</u> go.
<s> <u>Adolph</u>?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Thank you, Rose.
<s> Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
<s> Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
<s> That's enough.
<s> Never eat before the show.
<s> What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
<s> I'll be there--Good-by.
<s> You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
<s> What do you know about them?
<s> Jimmy!
<s> What's the matter?
<s> No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
<s> What is it?
<s> See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
<s> Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
<s> I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm getting seasick--
<s> Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
<s> Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
<s> What!--are you crazy?
<s> 500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
<s> Absolutely nothing.
<s> Not now.  I don't have time.
<s> I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
<s> Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
<s> I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
<s> Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
<s> How is he?
<s> You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
<s> Will somebody get the damn dog out-
<s> Yeah.  It's a fact.
<s> They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
<s> But she doted on the frowner
<s> Acquired?
<s> Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
<s> No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
<s> Political considerations?
<s> Cleans dirt. Let's go.
<s> It doesn't quite add up.
<s> We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
<s> You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
<s> Let me get you a cup?
<s> Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
<s> I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
<s> Okay...
<s> Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
<s> Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
<s> Carl --
<s> Somehow, I don't see that happening.
<s> Just watch.
<s> He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
<s> No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
<s> Fine, then we don't have a deal.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
<s> It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
<s> You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
<s> I'd really rather take care of it myself.
<s> No.
<s> Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
<s> Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
<s> Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
<s> It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
<s> This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
<s> Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
<s> Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
<s> Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
<s> I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
<s> Goodnight, Bones.
<s> Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
<s> Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
<s> The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
<s> It can be arranged...
<s> When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
<s> Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
<s> Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
<s> I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
<s> Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
<s> I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
<s> It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
<s> It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
<s> Yeah.  It was great.
<s> What'd you do, honey?
<s> Do you still love your husband?
<s> I'm not wearing any.
<s> Yup.										*
<s> Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
<s> Get going! 
<s> Is that your real name? Really?
<s> Cancoon.
<s> I don't blame you.
<s> You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
<s> Elliot Blitzer.
<s> Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
<s> In case.
<s> They'll be along.
<s> I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
<s> You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
<s> Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
<s> Nope.
<s> No.
<s> So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
<s> James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
<s> I...I...We need cash, James.
<s> No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
<s> Yeah, sure.  You got change?
<s> See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
<s> Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
<s> One way.
<s> Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
<s> You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
<s> I . . .
<s> John . . .
<s> You could just leave him.
<s> You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
<s> Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
<s> I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
<s> Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
<s> Sure, Sheriff.
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
<s> That's a solid name.
<s> An overheated car.
<s> Still playing?
<s> I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
<s> You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
<s> It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
<s> Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
<s> Can you make it back up?
<s> Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
<s> Which you don't have.
<s> Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
<s> I'll keep it in my office room.
<s> Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
<s> How much can you lift?
<s> I lied.
<s> Know what?
<s> Where is it?
<s> Oh.
<s> Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
<s> Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
<s> For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
<s> You ain't like that no more.
<s> Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
<s> We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
<s> Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
<s> McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
<s> Tough break.
<s> Business or personal?
<s> Someplace else, then.
<s> Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
<s> I told the D.A. everything I know.
<s> I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
<s> May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
<s> Why is that?
<s> ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
<s> I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
<s> Still looking.
<s> Yes.  It was, actually.
<s> I don't have a goddamned idea.
<s> He's not in, Sir.
<s> Yes.
<s> What for? Who are you?
<s> I want to know who you are.
<s> I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
<s> Madeleine died here.
<s> Yes?! But --
<s> Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
<s> Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
<s> Carlotta?
<s> Oh... this and that.
<s> Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
<s> What did you say?
<s> Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
<s> I am not flexible on this.
<s> Any time fat boy!
<s> She's still working?
<s> Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Yup.
<s> So what do we do?
<s> At the newsstand on 3rd.
<s> The wahoo?
<s> That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
<s> Yup.
<s> Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
<s> No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
<s> Where?
<s> I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
<s> I had so many things to think about!
<s> Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
<s> It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
<s> You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?

Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.

<s> Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
<s> I'm a dentist
<s> I don't want to talk about it -
<s> Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
<s> It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
<s> At home alone - where were you?
<s> She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
<s> You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
<s> Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
<s> It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.

<s> Your dad taught you everything.
<s> Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.

<s> Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
<s> Story's the same, Detective...
<s> And she wanted to talk.
<s> Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.

<s> Why --
<s> Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
<s> Yes...!
<s> Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
<s> I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
<s> Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
<s> Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
<s> All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.

<s> If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
<s> Let me.
<s> You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
<s> Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
<s> Is this what you're looking for?
<s> What's the deal?
<s> You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
<s> Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
<s> Some cigars.  Case of beer.

<s> No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
<s> What a filthy mess.
<s> Perhaps we'd better leave.
<s> And look at this, Doctor!
<s> So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
