Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
There.
You got something on your mind?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
do you listen to this crap?
She okay?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
Great
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
But
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
That I'm used to.
That girl -- I --
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
You got him involved?
Assail your ears for one night.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
You makin' any headway?
Hey -- do you mind?
Yeah
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
How'd you do it?
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
What's this?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't
Pick you up Friday, then
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
I say, do what you wanna do.
Why 're you doing this?
You don't care if I die
Why'd you let him get to you?
Dorsey.
Kat! Wake up!
And I'm in control of it.
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Who?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Wholesome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
The Partridge Family?
You up for it?
No.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
I know.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
What?!
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
I want to go with you!
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I believed in you...
May I speak freely?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
What's he doing?
... Into a monk...
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Are you married?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
I let her take a shower.
What was that, Korfin?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
I'm gonna propose.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
Why not?
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
I kill someone famous.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay, til tonight.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
This all you want?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Emil???!
It's easy to learn.
Robert...?
You've got a call.
Viewer discretion advised!
I know.
I'm here for movies.
No.  Go ahead.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
I'll send a cop back for you.
You okay?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
What?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
I guess not.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
CONTINUED
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true.
That's true
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Yeah?
Name?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
You're in a hurry.
Hello, again.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Bullshit.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
Luther was part of the gang?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Last night.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
You made that move, huh?
Let's go.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Do I get to kiss her too?
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
How did they get away?
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Doesn't look like it.
Bullshit red tape.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Hey, you're right.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Call me later.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
No wonder you're so popular.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Whaddya think?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
You're impossible...
Hard man to live with.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Stall.
How hot are they?
Surprise, Luther.
You want to go outside?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...would you like a drink?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Do you love her?
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Hello?
Hi Ma...
I'm sorry..
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Don't you open your messages?
...Shit!
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You noticed..
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
It's up to you now, Angel!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
It's not?
This is all that survived?
Talk English Doc.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You should have.
Who are you calling?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Excellent.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Is that him?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Who is Machine?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
You are a private investigator?
You're making me very angry.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Where are your parents?
What about me?
Wha... ?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Hello... ?
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
You told me to look, so I looked.
Hello?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
How... how can you say that to me...?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Yes... I remember Mary
What is this?
Her belongings?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Alice, you think you can leave?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
We'll figure it out.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
You look great!
Rick, please.
Enough of that crap.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Hey man, we're all sorry...
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What's wrong with me?
What is it?
Feeling better now?
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Mommy...?
What do you mean?
About him?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Very funny.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
What's that got to do with it?
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
What?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
Then get out!
Who's Jacob?
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
I don't understand.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
What course, Skipper?
Excuse me, Skipper---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
All ready?
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's a <u>face</u>???
Swell!
Why?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Always has been.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Guaranteed, eh?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
You stayed away?
Sure you did.
Saw him do it?
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
It's fun.
Are we going in this?
Pop?
That's illegal, you know.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Don't go playing policeman.
Huh?
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
I won't. You interested?
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you get his number?
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
This is nuts.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Rolfe.
Who?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
They aren't answering their hails.
Can we do that?
But they start executing hostages in
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Now, or he dies, please.
Leave my daughter alone.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Twenty minutes?
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
The fax machines.
and if that means negotiating...
One.
who can I say is calling?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
What's the story?
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Did you feel that?
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
What are you doing, Ted?
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
I'd use the word insane.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Now!
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Roger.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
He's carrying a bomb.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
You folks need any help?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You can't go in there!
Do you want to talk about it.
Ah, won't you sit down?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Can't you take a guess?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
No. No one that I know of.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
We'd better get back now.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Excuse me, Sister?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
I like my horizons narrow.
You are Cassandra?
William Harcourt?
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
What's this?  What's going on?
Nothing?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
She's going to divorce me.
Stop the car.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
How potent?
You think this is the guy who did it?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Yeah, Sykes?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
How can I go?
What?
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Have they located my daughter yet?
I get the picture.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
If I go.
That the atmosphere processor?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You son of a bitch.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
So.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
How do you feel?
What's the question?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Let's go!  Let's go!
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Don't go!  Please.
Can we dream?
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!

Maestro.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Oh!
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Is she a good fuck?
Hardly.
And how will you make him keep it?
You have leave to try.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Where?
No, I'm not playing this game.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Then he didn't send you?
Come back tonight.
This is not his handwriting.
Where's our friend?
Upstairs.
Really?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this, Salieri?
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Why so?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
What do you mean, Sire?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Would you tell me why?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Yes, sir.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Why are you here?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Father -
Oh, thank you, sir.
What medicine?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
How could I not?
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
Really? Why?
With all my heart, Mozart.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
A Mass for the dead.
Where is your wife?
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Are you ill?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
The Fire.
Do you have me?
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
So?
I do not seek forgiveness.
I can't say I do. What is it?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
What?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Oh my son, my poor son!
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
What does he want?
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch?
What shall we do?
No, why?
Mr. Kessler?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Do you like it?
What do you dream about?
How old are you?
How old are you?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
I was dreaming again?
Bathroom.
Anything.
I've left those pills for you.
David, what are you doing?
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
How are we feeling tonight?
I think he's a Jew.
There's no call for that kind of language.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
Two weeks?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Yes.
Well, I like it here.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Go on, ask them.
Could be a lot of things.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Thanks a lot.
It's you, David.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Get out of here, Jack!
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Hi, Jack.
Dr. Hirsch?
What's that?
Then you have some hot tea?
Sorry.
Oscar, what's the matter?
About twenty-four thousand.
Whose death?
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Say, you can't do that
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Fifty thousand dollars!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Well, what?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Shall we let the people come in?
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Longer.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
It's all right. Thanks.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
What time did this thing happen?
You're lying!
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
The ten dollars.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
He was in the bank yesterday.
What time did you get in?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Uhh, yeah it does.
How'd they --
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Damn!
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
He's planning a job.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
How?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Not now.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
I got seven thousand.
Beautiful.
Dammit!
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Boys...
Distracting enough for you?
You know him?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
This has been a good year.
And we're good at it.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Riders --
But still died.
Jesse, is that your hand?
You're sick of my company?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Let me see that.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Don't turn around.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
That's what I would have done.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
There's only four of them...
Good.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
With my money!
This is no game.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
So he's won.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Yes?
I can't.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Patrick?
We should do it.
I want a firm commitment.
But what about the past? Our past?
No, no, no.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Doesn't he live here?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
What...is...it?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
We are totally booked.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Patrick Bateman's office.
A model? An actor?
Well...
Welt...it depends, why?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Yeah.
She's my...cousin.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Who?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
That's so typical, isn't it?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Listen, what's your name?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Hey, Halberstam?
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
Is it over?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
It's important.
That took some fun out of --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
I can't just walk away!
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Great!
...wanna savor this.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
My goodness.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
...When did you know?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
We could move 'em up here.
How's it going?
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
You could've handwritten it.
Gary?
I think you should go.
Every entry was authorized.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
You calling Phil and Randy?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Bring it to the other location.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
You seem surprised to see me.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
When do I begin?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Yes?
Carnies.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Fancy a nibble?
Watch out, you're on my hair!
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Really, Austin!
Not in the Nineties.
Hello, luv.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
Not a good time to lose one's head.
I have something to tell you.
I love you, Austin.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Noooooooooooooo!
Oh my God, he's back.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Right.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
What did you say?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
I just don't see it.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't judge here.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Really?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Fear ...
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
People, too.
I resign.
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
You.
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
The result would be ...
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Choices?
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
I didn't. Mother did.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
This must be the last straw.
You followed me.
Mmm ... what are you doing?
But you did suspect me.
You're playing games.
I'm playing to win.
No, after you.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
What is it?
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Where's Mother?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
I was getting to it.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Weather's turning nasty.
Think she really killed those agents?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
The last one you'll ever see.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
That's what we're going to find out...
I've decided not to run for President.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Nice shot.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
God, you're a slob.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
Let go of me!
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
A strange wang right in my palm.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
That's it, prick lips.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Really?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Ed... you're kinky!
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
What's this?
He look familiar?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Anything else?
You're back.
Huh.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Hi.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
Where are you going?
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Did you pull me out?
Did I say thanks?
Just wondering.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
He just wants to --
Yeah? When was the last time?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Anyway, down here, take a look...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Didn't think you'd make it.
You don't know him.
Alderman Swayzak.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
People.
So what are you doing here?
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Oh, really?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
I'm not smiling.
What's that?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You're in this up till ya neck.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
I would like to change your name.
You're now Mantan.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
But the line has to be drawn.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
Word!!!
I'm feelin' dis'!
That's a great handle.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
This has to be a big mistake.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I love you too, Daddy.
You lost me.
Sounds risky to me.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
Your life will never be the same.
Same here.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Is that good or bad?
How so?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
No joke.  Serious.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Regardless, he still is your father.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
I slept too near where I fell out.
The good stuff.
You don't read, do you?
How did you get this gig?
You leave something out?
And?
I know I won't be your puppet.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I have no luggage.
For whom else have you worked?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
You want my heart?
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
By name only.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
I don't want to go --
What about Pike?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I don't know... I like the Army.
There's no need...
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
You smoke, Ray?
That'd be my reaction too --
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
He -- He made me do it --
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
He said he worked there --
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Why?
Why... why didn't you tell me?
His chest was hamburger --
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
What happened to "degrees"?
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Where are they!
How are you?
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Ah, Christ
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
Baseball?
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
What is that?
Something like that. You?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
I didn't shoot West...
You wanted to break him.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
No.
Hardy, what are you doing --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
He was your friend.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
This is totally unnecessary --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Someone stole my backpack.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Bloom like a flower?
What is this place?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Fine, you do it.
Well, she... uh...
In so many words, yes.
Helping people makes me happy.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Really.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
Spooning the sherbet.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
There was one time when I was eleven...
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
She was a witch.
You know where the chemicals are?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
The river.
Where are we headed?
I'm sorry.
You don't even know me.
I was drying out.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
You didn't become crazy.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I talked with your father last night.
Do you love your father?
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Was she one of your teachers?
Mom?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Yes.
What?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
I need to know who you are first please.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
No.
She says she has a secret to tell.
Binoculars.
Tell me.
Do you believe in love?
How is bank?
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants the money from your bank.
Oh Jesus.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Syevodnya?
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
I don't want to know.
So what are you going to do?
I do. I want to very badly.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Fine.
So uh...
Excuse me?
I don't want to talk about it.
And? What are you saying?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
You are throwing me out.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I don't know.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Okay. Thank you.
Something else.
Is the flight full?
How do you want to pay?
Then start taking them seriously.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
I bet you have loyal customers.
Still need a lift?
What happened?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
YOU SHUT UP!
Or what? OR WHAT?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
I said... STOP!
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Where you gonna be?
How you feelin' today?
I know that.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
You need some weed?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
You get a call from Rose?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Heard about this morning.
So...  That your first time?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What'd you say?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Getting very weird.
You'll take care of that.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Nick!
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
Did I say that?
Nick...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Nick --
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Nick!
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Someone attacked him.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
You all right?
Louder, pal, louder.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Ich said you left.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
Don't be an ass.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
Where's the wife?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
We're in?
I still think you're a bastard.
This is my stop.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
Could you fill me in?
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
With these?
Good.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
And what can he do for you?
What's the problem?
I want more life, fucker.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
Show me something?
Where are you going, Sebastian?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
What was he after?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Yeah.
She was gonna get away.
You equipped for random questions?
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Yes?
Thank you very much.
How old am I?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Money?
Taffey Lewis?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
Jeezus!
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
I've already got more help than I need.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
How come you're not on the job?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
But then how can you...
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
May I ask a personal question?
Well?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Oh, now, that's a great one!
Bravo!
Well, that depends...
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Wait!  Wait!
Why are you doing that?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Then forget it.
This is for me.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
I don't want to be alone.
When do you need her by?
Could we talk about that a little later?
Where's he gone?
He has a computer?
May I please be excused?
All right.
Hey, Eve!
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Okay. I like that.
You wanted to see me!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I don't blame you!
Eve?!
I'm really sorry!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I know first aid!
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Uh-huh. Adam?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
My pleasure.
A card?
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
These are wonderful.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
I love Lucy!
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
No.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Yes. He likes windows.
Not on him.
Why did you park way back there?
You don't look thirty-five.
Twenty-five? Around there.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Say what?!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
No.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Good god.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
It shuts off automatically.
No.  They all do.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Days??
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Why?
Hi, honey!
What did you wish for, Adam?
If we still have one.
He's smart.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
You came back for these?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Um... Eve?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
I don't think so.
To get some frozen poultry.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Adam!!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Frank. Come in.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
Okay?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Hi, can I come in?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
You what?
Yes.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Hold me, Don.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
He's comin' back? What for?
Hello, daddy.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hello?
No thanks.
What are you lookin' at?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Well. Okay.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Hi Dad.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
What else is new? Right?
What happened to him?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
Who, me? Why should it?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
You like mysteries that much?
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay.
What was that all about?
NO.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
What did he bring him in for?
Are ya ready?
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
What?
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
Anybody see ya?
What the fuck are you doing?
Look again for fuck sake!
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
What?! What are you doin'?
No ma! No!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
We're alive.
What are you going to do?
Hey Murphy?
Absolutely not.
I don't know they just always need it.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
The what man?
How many bodies, Greenly?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
What are you serious?
No. You sure you're okay?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Hello? You there?
Yes.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Why?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Is it back in?
Dignan, calm down.
There's another stocker, right?
Holy shit.
Why not?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
I'll just say it.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
She's from Cuba.
He's gone. He stole the car.
When'd he tell you?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Why don't you come with us.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
That's what she is!
Who's in the car?
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Uh-huh?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
What's happening? What's going on?
Freeze!
What are you doing?
Come on.
What are you talking about?
Dignan, it's too late.
Does it float?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Congratulations. You passed the test.
No, that door over there.
We're renegades from despair.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
See you.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
You think he got my license plates?
How long are they going to hold him?
Bob, where you going?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Give him a second.
You OK, Bob?
Jesus, Bob.
Were you born in Mexico?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
What?
No.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
What was that all about?
What did I say?
The guy is fucking insane.
Bob.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
What the fuck possessed you?
This could be a trap.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Yes, I do.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Right. It was extremely stupid.
Come on!
Come on, Bob.
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
How long do you have to go?
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
Where did he go?
Where?
Is that your chiquita?
No. Just pool.
Come on in!
You told me Bourne was dead.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Treadstone.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I want to know what happened.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Why not? It was just money.
She say what time I should call?
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
I have to go now.
Front. Use your teeth.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
-- what? --
I'll get the book.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
-- where's left to go? --
You drive.
I wanted to kill him.
I did.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Say it.
And you got to him before we could.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No... Jason... please...
Who?
Oh, shit...
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
Show me.
How long have you worked for the agency?
What kind of problems?
Good luck.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
Some women like Dobermans --
Is it fresh?
Does anyone know his politics?
He won't come.
Longshanks promised!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Good day to you, M'Lords.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
I do not confess.
I want... to marry you!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Why did you?
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
No dances, just tell me.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
I... I blacked out.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
I don't know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
Oh God... what did we do?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Ouch.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
I know, but...
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
What time is it?
Smells like sex in here.
Can... can... Can I have this?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Destroy it?
Look what you made me do!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Just get out, didja?
Meant no offense.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Lenny? Come on!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
He did. Captain Renault did.
So you decided to go to America.
Does he know that?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
Goodnight.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Yes, I come.
Er, goodbye, sir.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
And Mademoiselle?
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Yes, of course, we --
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Please.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Does he always leave so early?
You are very kind.
Ilsa, I --
Be careful.
Hello, Rick.
Good morning.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
No, Captain, please.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
My bill.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I believe you have a message for him?
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Hello, Louis.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
This is the end of the chase.
He is traveling with a lady.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, it's my party.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
You're late.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Make it official, if you like.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Rick! Rick, help me!
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
You ever going to bed?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
It's bad.
Save some for tomorrow.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
No more water, you said.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Got to follow the paper path here.
Merry Christmas eve.
He is a cute thing.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
Get back?  From where?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
If I'd known you were alive --
What's that?
What was inside?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Come on.  Try.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Yes, yes he did.
Thought you were going to bring her.
But chickens?
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
I was making a point.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Hello?
How about we go somewhere else?
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Take your time.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I mean your parents.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
How many months are you?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I've never seen a lobster.
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
People watched the movies in their cars?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Stop it! Just cut it out!
Please don't make me say it again.
"...did." Well, okay.
How is that Wally doing?
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
That's true.
That's a heavy sedation.
*Liver* killed him?
Did you know your mother better?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Liberator...
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
What's that? What's it called?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
*What* view?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
So, what do you do?
Silicon Valley?
Can --
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Grifters...
So how'd you get caught?
She had you tempting fate.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
Ten is standard, sir.
Whoa. What?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
She up for this?
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Jake --
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Why?
How much?
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
What -- What do we do?
That's not --
What about Customs?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
You need to get a haircut.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
You got my cell. Leave a message.
Stop waving that thing around.
It's bad luck.
Meet me at my place later.
We're working for the King.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Pretty much.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
So what do you want?
Still time.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
You guys awake?
Peace of mind.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
It's just insurance.
I'll take you up on that.
You're shaking.
I got scared.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Eight-fifty.
I found her in bed with someone.
I had training. In the Republic.
You're shaking. What is it?
I loved it blond.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
That girl, she works at the casino --
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Nothing about you.
What?
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
What happened?
I'm in trouble.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
Next time it'll be my neck.
Would you like a drink?
I don't think we should meet again.
Jani! Where are you?
Ross.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where do you live, Jack?
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
Who are these guys?
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Where's the magnet?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
You want me to check?
Girlfriend?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
Thanks for the information.
How do you feel, Jack?
Yeah.
What's he doin'?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key, goddamit, the key!
What was that, I didn't hear...
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Armed.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
This is fun.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Do you know why I went after Justine?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Why would I be pissed?
What is it?
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What a creep.
You didn't...
You're a thief?
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
You got a lotta nerve.
Bent.
I'm sorry.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
What do you want?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Yeah.
A long time.
Gotta go.
Unlikely.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Please...
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Who are you?
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Right, the big one-oh.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
For a change.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Whoa... she is a killer.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Whoa... she just farted.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Dude, this is all I got.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Oh, hi, mom.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
But, mom!
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
No.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
I feel bad for his family.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
I'm not following you.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Who is... we?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Well...
That's alright... I understand.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
Hey.
My mom is gone.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Grandma Death.
So how was school today?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Don't you watch the news?
Follow him where?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
What is her name?
Can anyone else see him?
Is Callie still around?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Where are we going, Donald?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Our son just called me a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
What?
He was a year ahead of us?
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
You're what?!
You-betcha.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Mrs. Leeman?
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
And the bite marks on my ears?
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
This here's Loretta.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
You don't know where this is gonna...
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
I'm a mirror.
That bitch from...
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Why wasn't I insulted?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
You no gotta no gun.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Anything else? 
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
Are you getting tired?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Then it's war?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
So that's the one you want to marry.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
John loves the house.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Like this. 
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Are you comfortable here?
What is it, Treves?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Alas, no.
Tell me about it, please!
Have you read it?
Want to come out?
Of course! You want out?
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
I'll have to find some more.
Hello...
Mmmerrick.
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
This... is my new home?
Ohhh...
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Good morning, John.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
You want a dressing bag, John?
You did this for me?
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
No, John, not one that I can see.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Well... where is he?
Those things in your hands.
What?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
We mustn't let him land!
Halfdan the Black.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Erik. You don't understand.
But you don't realize....
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
Do you believe I love you?
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
What do you see, Erik?
No. 
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Is there something the matter with it?
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
About NOT raping you...
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Is THAT Odin?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
How deep IS the ocean?
Slower! In... Out...
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
SHUT UP!
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
You must help us.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
That's better.
Weren't we supposed to?
There is another way.
I think we should go...
Wait, Erik!
What do you think?
But HOW?
Look, I bagged it last week.
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
Let me go, Sven.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Shut up!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
I must KILL! Kill!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
And you've got BOTH axes?
And something to sharpen them with?
Yeah, you told me that later.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Come over after I'm done here?
You rat.
How are you today?
Really?
Really? Because --
I can't remember.
I don't really know how --
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
You're sure? It's cold.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
You like that?
I don't know.
Well, I should probably get going.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
You should stay.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
Let me drive you home.
Let's talk about it later.
I want to know you.
Joely...
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
What if you hide me?
Joel!
Do you remember what we talked about?
Right. Something black though.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
Oh God, how horrid.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
What do we do?
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
I think, before.
I knew.
Have sex. Y'know --
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
A bully? Moi?
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
It's true.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
It was snowing.
It's them.
How's the chicken?
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Definitely!
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Oh.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Thanks.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
What, Howard?
You made me have an abortion.
Well, where was Patrick?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
The voltage looks fine.
What's your bartlett's?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Where are the others?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
That's Jellybean!
Extraordinary!
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
What do you think?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Thanks.
You're the best?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
But Countess...
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
...do you copy?
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
But Justin...
What?
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
Is that an offer?
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What is it?
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
Do you hear it? Right there.
What's wrong?
What's happening...?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
90 over 50 and falling... .
You're not seriously considering sending him?
Does he know that?
What does?
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Peters is right, no one's here.
I can see the hatch.
Peters...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
No one?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
You can't leave. She won't let you.
I told you... She won't let you leave...
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Heading three-three-four...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Do we have enough time for a weld?
But...
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Now what?
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Everybody okay?
It tastes bad.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
Maybe one of the original crew?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
Go ahead.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
No. I saw nothing.
Almost got it.
Hey...
The safety circuit's failed!
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
What is it?
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't.
What are you doing here?
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
The shields on the station should protect us.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
What?
And where do we think we're going?
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
I'm driving.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Then what is it?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Hi, Brad.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Leave me alone!
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Do you want to take a quick swim?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's definitely your mama.
Did you get her number?
Did you get her name?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Damone, are you there?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Are you Linda Barrett?
Not if you're over sixteen.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
He is.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Was it great?
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
I paid for it and everything.
Sometime?
Can I come in?
I couldn't make it in time.
You better save some for me, you swine!
What's that?
Well, you'll find out next year.
What can I get for you tonight.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
Where do you feel like going?
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
I had a really nice time tonight.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
I made a fool of myself.
Really?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Anything to drink?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Rum and ice, please.
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Naw!
What happened? What did they do to her?
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Why?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
When does this thing stop?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
What tape?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Lucy.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
No, she's looking for you.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
What is this?
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
You realize...
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Stop it.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
You got something better?
So, your husband ditched you?
What now, Geronimo?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What is this?
How much you got?
How much you got to see the show?
What? Really?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Four door?
Max?
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Got 'cha!
SHIT.
OH JESUS!
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
What's wrong?
Let's go.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Go! Go!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
We should stick together out there.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Well... come on.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I guess so, sir.
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
Okay, but come here first.
What's up?
A rich actress.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
What does Clifford say?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Get your clothes on, lady --
There've been some calls.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
...Don't you?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
Were you an alcoholic?
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
I'm going back to the hotel.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Why... yes.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
What?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Harry.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Frances...
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Where are we, mean man?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
What happened? Who're you?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Well, who have we here...?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
How long will you be?
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Haven't you heard what I said?
Mama, shut up!
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Yes...?
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
What?
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
Nice.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill you? Hardly that.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Soon?
This was not taken from a grave.
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
You dance so beautifully together.
Nothing. Still nothing.
Are you all right?
I wish to be your wife.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
I thought I'd never see you again!
Brother and sister no more.
Victor!
I was just clearing my throat.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Yes? And?
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Preposterous.
Your men are right to be afraid.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Good night, Alice.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
How the... did he get in there?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
I don't hear it anymore.
How come?
Claudette...
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Looks like a storm.
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
What's this guy's problem?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Died instantly?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
You're a preacher?
Was? As in not anymore?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Why are you so agitated?
To your family.
It's the bitterest of pills.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
What do you think Mom would say?
I'm going for 'em!
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
Mexico.
Do what?
Do you believe me?
Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
We have to go back for Daddy!
Should I use the last bullets on us?
See ya.
What the fuck was that about?
Richie? You okay?
All I'm saying --
Keep your voice down.
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
You know what you look like?
I'm here with you.
My shit is together.
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Got it.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Of course, but there's more --
None at this time, sir.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
No, sir, WHAT?
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Shit.  Think we're had.
White House boys want a private meeting.
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, question, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am.
You know him.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Just do it, okay?
O'Neil?
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
I'll try anyway, sir.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Chances of recovery?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Which is guy-speak for...
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
O'Neil?
Do you, uh, know...
She part of the training?
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
I just wonder how that happened.
Subject?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
I like that image.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Animal, I can't.
He's not going to do it.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
And you think this creature is one of them?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Your old sweetheart?
Did you talk with Humphries?
Mr. Caiman...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
That is our job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
I understand.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
Come on, old friend...
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
He's a miserable twit!
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
"Go into the cloud! ...
Okay, we got it.
What do you mean?
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
U.... What do you think?
... What does that mean?
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
Hi everybody.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
What?
It's Jason...
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
There's nobody here. Jason...
Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Thank God. Are you okay?
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
never doubted you for a second.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Yes.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
An interstellar vox.
Weapons storage...
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Then how did he find out about the device?
Former Commander?
Commander...
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
Do your best, Tommy...
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Continue forward, sir?
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
What's your advice, Alexander?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
They are... friends of Congress.
Makes you gag.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
A grand scheme?
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
You must be very rich.
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
A horseshoer?
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
George, you know I only love you, but...
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Where... do those men come from, George?
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
All people have rights!
Yes!
You hear that?
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
You get the money?
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
You positive about that?
I'm working on a few things.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
Get in line, bro.
Your wife a Lakers fan?
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Something shouldn't be there.
I'm looking at you.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
You make movies, huh?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
She looks familiar.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
One we're producing.
Very nice...
What's that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
It's all mine.
Rough day on the set?
You saw that one?
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
Why not?
I don't know.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
You don't act like it?
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Whatta you doing out there?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
What's wrong?
Which two?
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Lufkin. His... agent.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
You think the extra strain caused it?
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
What day is it?
The turbine blew.
Roger.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
How much longer's that gonna take?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Goddamit, Dodge.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Sounds like the hull.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the hell happened!
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
You're late.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Stay away. Or else.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
You okay?
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
You just shoot at something?
He needs a doctor.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
The ah... the radio's out.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
What happened.
Nope.
What do we do with him?
Over the gold.
You killed them.
So you killed them?
Call the Coastguard?
He took the shotgun and a light.
Can't find the shotgun.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
You're kidding, right?
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Give up?
Yup.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
What are you trying to say?
Did you actually do this painting?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
...wow...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
It's not optional!
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Forget it.
Hi Josh.
Do you want something to drink?
Yeah, right...
Hi Enid.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
Why?
Much later.
Hi, Al!
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
You can have that one.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
I want to do him!
What's he doing now?
He's insane!
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
Ew ... when did you get that?
How about this?
I know a party we could go to...
Give me all your money, bitch!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
That rules!
But those are our people...
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Look, we have to get these...
Don't you want nice stuff?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Hello?
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Oops! I dropped it!
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Well are --
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Yes, that would certainly do...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
Hey, can I borrow this?
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Well when can we do something?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
I... I don't think so.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
...What do you mean?
What's the matter?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Talk to us about it...
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
I don't know.
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
You were contracted to work-
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
I am a man of peace.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Pleasant journey?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
What?
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
Very good indeed.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Anything special about them?
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Finish your tour?
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
What a good week.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Have you got it?
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
I'll have to.
Did it look like this in your mind?
Nonsense.
For you.
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Janosz?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
No, you didn't, Frank.
What do you think?
His name is Oscar.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
Good luck.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
I'm not even good for me.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
That's a terrible thing to say.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
That's quite a story.
Well, good night, Louis.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
Then why have you come?
This is the one that looked at Dana.
I command you.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
You were supposed to help me with this.
Who was that?
Nothing.  Not a trace.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Rivers of the stuff!
Who, Ray?
What's that?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
This is what you do with your spare time?
What happened?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Ready?
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Now where are you going?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
That's too bad.
On a purely scientific basis.
I want to help you.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
You must have gotten the last copy.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Oh, that's very - unusual.
In the physical sense.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
What on earth gave you that idea?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh!  You're here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Where's the Keymaster?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Anything!  Just make contact.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
For what purpose?
They will.
How do you know?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Who was the architect?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Me, too.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Yeah, Judgement Day.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
What is that... wailing?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
Then you'd be out of a job.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
So am I.
Take grain away from the army?
Yes, Caesar?
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
The Senate too?
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
Where are they?
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
As soon as I can.
Serious stuff...
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
What about their philosophy lessons?
You need to come home!
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Death is a very light thing for you.
Take your hands off me animal!
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
Aren't you eating?
Will you take me home now?
What is the matter?
Do you?
Was she married or something?
With a family?
Did they ever find out?
And it's all over now.
What is it?
You mean the one who --
No -- don't cry --
Yes.
I want to ask you a question.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Please let me go.
Don't tell me --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
The marble?
You won't?
But you might.
We just can.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
I just don't think it would work.
Carl who?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Are you listening?
BENJAMIN?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'd rather not.
Yes sir?
Where is your luggage?
In general.
Will you come in, please?
What do you think of me?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
I think I'll go to bed.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
He didn't see me.
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Yes?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Thank you.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Do you really want me to?
What?
There isn't any.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
What?
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
I have my reasons.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Did I say that?
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson --
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
Braddock -- Braddock?
Can I talk to you a minute?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Well -- when did you decide all this?
I'm just --
I guess -- about my future.
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
What?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
But why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Yes?
I want to speak --
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Need any help?
How?
I've quit.
He must be very nice.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
You?
Reducing?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
We'll dance.
Chasing around.
I'll do anything for you.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
I want to be alone --
No.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
Really?
There.
Very early in the morning.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Bless you...
I'm worried about you.
Till then.
The Baron is tired?
Ready, Kringelein?
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Hello! Hello! --
Telegrams?
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
You're a very unusual stenographer --
You...
What?
What brown hands you have.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Yes.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
No water -- What a place!
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Sorry, Preysing. 
Yes --
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Shall I tell them again?
You see -- what we are interested in --
Madam should sleep.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Take them back, Suzette.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
He will be on the train.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
You're discharged.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
No. No word.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
What's the matter with you?
What's bluff?
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
Pretty as a picture.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Whadaya say?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
I tripped over a chair.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Myra followed you, huh?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
At what?
You want a drink?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Her job.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I've heard the name.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Upstate.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Take a hike, you mean?
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Yeah?
You were gone for a while.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
That's natural.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Mr. Simms.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
A dead body?
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
It's John, isn't it?
This kid just wants his freedom.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
You aced it, didn't you?
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
My, God!  What have you done to him?
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Where are you going?
Where's the baby?!
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
You've created a monster.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Miss me, baby?
No.
Home.
You know what gets me?
Can I have the Cadillac?
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Months?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Okay.  Okay.
Is Penelope in?
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
For Africa.
What went wrong?
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You're my buddy.
Sir?
College?
It makes life spicy.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
What's this?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Can I help you, sir?
I'm engaged.
What do you do for a living?
Some kind of animal?
Disease?
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Which one?
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
A dozen?
He knows you shattered his violin.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
You're begging him to kill you?
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I'm going to call the police.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
I mean it!
Ooops.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
I feel the same way.  What next?
None.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
This is man to man.
You're old--so old.
You're a son of a bitch.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
With spittle?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
Here.  Finish the job.
I'm going to shoot you now.
What is this thing that kills me?
I dunno, boy.
Because he was cruel?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I don't really know.
What's his name?
Mom?
We don't have a maid any more.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
What was it?
Possibly.
I'm sorry.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
I wish Paul luck.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
Do it!
Or get eaten alive.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
No, just not the type.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
What?
That's cool.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Hello. You want some information?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Yeah.
Joanne?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
No.
Neither am I.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
More or less.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
Why do you say that?
Did you find out where she was?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Yeah, sure.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
What happened, pilgrim?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
You're talking about real excitement?
Who told you about this?
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Jake.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
What does that do?
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
Jake'll take care of me.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
You are at the University, Candy?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Your tree.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
But there is a family resemblance.
Officer, I can explain.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
A block of ice.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
But this is my car.
Yearse!
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
What do you think?
You look as if you could.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
What is it?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
No.
Okay?
He's stopped.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
No. I'd feel stupid.
But they'll put me in jail.
You sure have a way with people.
Yes.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Just give me a rough estimate.
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
Harold?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
The moment of truth.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Parasite!
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Well, I didn't.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Yes... Yes. You look...
She's done it.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
I... remember.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
That's all for you, Sammy.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
It's almost over!!
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
I don't want him.
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Yup.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Myers?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Anything else you --
Are you sure about this?
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Goodnight, then.
Out? Out out?
You're going alone?
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
He -- loves you.
What about you?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
You fucking ass-holes.
That your daughter?
Oh.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
We've got such sights to show you --
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia!
You remember.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
You bastard --
Don't look at me.
Help me.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Later.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Kirsty.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
What happened?
Kirsty? It's very late.
What's the problem?
It's ONE of these.
How long since you were here?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
Larry!
Well?
You're done worse.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Larry...
What's wrong?
What are you drinking?
Plain soda?
You know it's not often I... you know...
You know, you're very beautiful.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
Where are you?
Great.
Big house.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
I'm afraid it's true.
We're on the Cointreau.
You know I do know the way home.
Oh!
I've been better.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What did I say?
'Bye.
Alison's.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
You gotta be kidding me.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
We'll do it next Monday.
Nice, Barry.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
What did he ever do to you?
What are you snickering about?
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Why not?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
He's got one!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Who are you going to see?
Anna Moss.
Right.  Why?
Your desert island top-five.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Yeah.
Huh?
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Are you all right?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Rob.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Laura?  Are you okay?
I dunno.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Shit!
Hi.
Are you coming home?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I don't know.
You won't like it.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
You know I'm a good person.
Don't forget your CDs.
Do you want me to be there?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
What do you want to do?
C'mon.  I want to know.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
It's a great song.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Are you okay?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
That way.
I'll call you.
So so.  Up and down.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
We're not there yet, Justin.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
You're the expert.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Happy birthday.
Would you remember his name?
-Okay okay.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Someone beat you.
No.
He sees me as a threat.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
There are differences.
Don't.
What is it?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Aye.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
He told me there could be only one.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Something pretty.
You're wrong.
Finish your prayers?
Don't threaten me, Private.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Are you sure?
_Answer_ me.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
How do you mean?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
The five hundred? Sure.
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Mr. Burns --
Well, I'll try to give her one.
How's business, Bruce?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Sure you can. Come on.
What do you mean by that?
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Bermuda.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Then what does he want with you?
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
What do you mean?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Exclusive? That's great.
Never mind that. What's the story?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
She jumped out of the window.
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Hildy!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Hello -- hello...
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Don't open that!
How was that for a tight squeeze?
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Well -- what is it?
Hildy!
Then why are you doing it?
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
How much?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Who locked the door?
Hey!
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Hold the phone!
Goodbye, Yonson.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
After all I've done for you --
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Pure politics!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Shoot to kill, I said.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
A sight for sore eyes!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
Who is it?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Any news?
Look out, you --
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Kings and sixes.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
What's the idea?
Hey --
What's from the Governor?
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
They wouldn't take it.
Look out!
There she is!
Baldwin -- his name is.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
Give him the you-know-what.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
It's true.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Crocodiles! Aah!
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
We all had to write a last letter home.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
You know it? It must be an old one.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Is it peace in out time?
I can't do it. What's the point?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
It seems to have survived.
I wish it could all have been different.
What did I do to deserve this?
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Cone.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
What about the tree?
Which way?
How much further?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Is your brother ready to go?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
Wondering what?
What the hell are you laughing about?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
What's this?
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
What was that?
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Honk at him. Scare him.
What's he so excited about?
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Go around him.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Fine. I'll go straight.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
What are you doing!
And...
Goddamn.
Fuck your grandmother.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
What was that?
I don't hear anything.
A couple hours!
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Where's Bill?
Well hello, officer.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Hey.
We gotta break it open.
Mr. Willis?
What about the body you found?
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Shall we close up, then?
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
My little French.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
My brother is discreet.
Yeah. My brother told me.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
How'd you know where I was?
Your brother should have his license revoked.
I'll be in touch.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Oh, and the sun block?
What SPF, sweetie?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I don't know. Something.
Come on.
Who is it?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
So, how's it going today?
Really?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
You were gone a long time.
So he's doing okay?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Wait!
Pittsburgh?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
To win.
You bastard.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
We'll be there.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Sign up.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Here, I got it.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
I'll beat him the next game.
They're fine.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Whaddya mean?
Quit. He's too good.
How much we got?
HOW MUCH?!
Findley.
When?
What time?
There it is. I'm broke.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You quittin', friend?
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Yeah? What do you do now?
You got it all in your head?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
What did all this stuff cost you?
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eddie, what's in that case?
What are you writing?
What happened?
No. You?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
No, I want to walk.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Oh, grow up.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Fifty-seven.
Go on back to the hotel.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Where do you come from?
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Why don't you start with me?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
You and that damned garden.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Only got one kind.
Hell of a night.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Is the hill ours too?
Why, Dad?
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
I had an awful dream.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
Where's your car?
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
We were having a little talk.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I swear it was here.
What is it?
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
You're being paranoid.
Just my luck, no ice.
You still believe in him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Love was never our problem.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
Pops, you're a genius!
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Nice meeting you.
We're loose!
Is my wife in the air?
How're we doing?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
He's trying to impress you.
You can't go. Call them back.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You're late.
Oh. Sorry.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Can they be killed?
Why did you people come here?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Marcus!  I did it!
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Look what you did!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
I said go around!
What are you going to do?
How did you get here?
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
It is you Junior!
I'll never forgive myself --
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
...you did it.
If only I could have been with you.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
Dad!
What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
What did you get?
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Those people are trying to kill us!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
I like Indiana.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
I'm going after those horses.
I don't need camels.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Who?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
That was a misunderstanding.
Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What does it mean, Indy?
Come one, what's wrong?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
You don't look very good.
You all right?
What'd he say?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Took what?
And then they took their children.
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Can you move your arm?
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
Not leftovers?
Primitive sexual practices?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Oh no -- oh no!!
WILLIE?!
A fulcrum release lever!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
What?
I can't!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Who was it?
Who?
Al.
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Somebody's been here.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
What for?
What was that?
You weren't listening!
I'll tell you what to say.
Anyone there?
Behind us?
Why? AL  You know too much.
Yeah...Who is?
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
Like the guys that attacked us.
That's not a good idea.
Who is it?
What do we do?
What about money?
It's illegal.
They'll know who I am.
Eating sushi?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
What is it?
You're beautiful..
She doesn't seem to understand.
What?
Where is she staying?
It worked.
You really like that shirt?
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
I feel like an idiot.
What Happened?
Better. I found Ryuji.
What next!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
He hung us up dry.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Do something.
I have been... I think you're right.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
You're a lucky man.
What are you doing?
JOE What abilities...?
Nice?
What happened?
You didn't tell us you were coming?
How about a deal?
Bit expensive, sir.
Who is your friend?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Yes?
It is to me too.
...Foreign service.
What brings you here?
Your memory.
When you remember...
Don't you want to get out?
Joe.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
What?
Oh...and who is it!?
I can't do that?
You again.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Why did you leave?
What did you tell them?
Were you working for him last night?
He didn't.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Hiroshima.
What?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
What?
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
He told me what to do.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Wait.
You can't take that.
What's new?
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
What does that do?
Shit...
I don't know what he was thinking.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
I'm afraid you are.
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
That computer has everything...
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
What's going on?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
What?!
Yeah...
Is it too late?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I'm here.
We're there.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
No shit.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Yeah.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Mike... in my...
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
Lowell, I can't afford --
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I told the truth!
Where are you, anyway?
What about now?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Poor communication skills.
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
So she's uh, flourishing?
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
No!
What a touching story.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Excuse me?
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
You're in check.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
Is Tong older than Ming?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
No.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
What is it you're after, Miles?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
He's passionate.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
To victory.
Marylin? When did I say...?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Is that you?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She never particularly cared for me.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Friends?
No.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
But?
I want to nail you ass.
Hello Marylin.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I was devastated. Of course.
Do you know him?
Lilly's up.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
You're not...
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
Mr. Massey --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
Wrigley!
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Three is not Farrow.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
How is she?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
I might.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
Where are you taking me?
Ellie
I knocked several times.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Who is he?
Ridiculous!
Well!
Are you going to see him?
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
What happened?
Oh, yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
What for?
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
Your ego is colossal.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Who are you?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Thanks, professor.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Not a one.
Peter
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Uh-huh. Want one?
You think it's simple, huh?
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Here comes a car!
What're you going to do?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Any luck?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
You're forgetting you're married.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
But can't you wait until morning
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
Up yonder. See the lights?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Get out of here!
Joe, listen
If it's on the level.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
What do you reckon that's for?
Yeah.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Right.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Did he pay?
Recall any names?
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
But why?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Can you get some sworn statements?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Why?
...Oswald?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Four to six.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
I'm not sure I understand.
No.  Never heard of him.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
Honey, you all right? 
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Time?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Are they?  Why would they?
Jim Garrison?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
How much more?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
You have other information?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Do you walk home?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
What's the problem?
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
What's this?
But now you're telling us now you do.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
I'd love one, but not there.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
You get a chance to use it?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Want to hear some music?
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Fifteen thousand.
Well, hello.
Does it happen to all men?
Who was your girl before Annette?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Will Ordell go for that?
You think he's got a thing for you?
He tries to act cool.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
Did you do it that night?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
It'll be more than that.
In a dress.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
I never lied to you.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Most of the times.
Yes'm.
We'll just be a minute.
We can look into that.
Not really.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
Ever been tempted?
I have no idea.
Killian's.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
You think I'm kidding?
Jackie?
What do you think it is?
I understand woman, damn!
Yeah?
Yeah.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
You told em? You told em it's me?
Didja tell 'em anything else?
I don't know. One of your friends.
No, I give it to someone else first.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Plus the same deal as before.
Who?
Drink?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
With Ordell?
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Please.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
We're leaving now!
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
I'm going to wait in the car.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
You couldn't just hit her?
You shot her twice?
Came outta where?
What'd you shoot her with?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
That's Winston. He works here.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Hey, Max.
Somebody already did.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
That's all?
Well, give it to me then.
All I did was walk out with it.
In a way, yes.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
Uh-huh.
She's all alone.
Turn left.
Who is it?
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
What are you talking about?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
There was a bang.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
You think they're connected?
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She hates me, Louis.
Jake, you need to rest.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
What was that?
Where are you?
What do you think?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Thanks.  What's that?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Ready?
I'm going home.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Why? What for?
What'd the doctor say?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Remember that.
While you were in the shower.
Don't!
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Please.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
What's going on?
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Where are they?
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
I can't move.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
How was Palm Springs?
You got a nice tan, though.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Clear the area. This is an order!
We're doing everything we can.
Lennox Hospital.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
I just need to talk.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Everywhere, like a plague.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Can I help you?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Okay, enough of this shit.
I don't have all day, kid.
Duck fuckers?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Where have you been?!!
Creepy.
Better let me.
We're not supposed to do that.
Kay-Em!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
How many?
Where is...?
Then what do we do?!
Earth II.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
I'm with you kid.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Where is everybody? What happened?
Give me a break! What happened?
Where are you going?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Hey.
That's why I'm here.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Did you like it?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
It's time.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
And what's with the headgear?
Now that's just gross.
I'm missing two!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
You're so bossy.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Kay-em you okay?
Leave him behind!
I gotta go back.
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You're not going anywhere.
Guys, please come with me!
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Yes!
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Just a favor for your old man.
My cars. And a comic book.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
This is Matt Hooper...
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
You got it?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Did you get him in the head?
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
He's comin' up -- !
Probably out in the back yard.
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
How come you have to tell them that?
Colorful, isn't he?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Now tell me something I don't know.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
How can you tell?
He ate a car?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
Quint...?
You from around here?
Look at him take it!
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Over there!
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
He's heading under -- !
What can that gun of yours do?
So, what do you think we should do?
What's up?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Wait, let me take that.
You know it's okay.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Just like our moms and teachers!
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Cool it.
Wow, dream big!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
What? My eyes are not lying!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Viscera?
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
We definitely want it to have junk.
The Wizard of Gore?
Uh, thanks.
Cute?
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
What?
No.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
You should try Adderall.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh my God...
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
What?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Excuse me?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Yeah, like people in love.
Dad, no!
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
I sort of already have.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
You're not listening to me.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
You guys are playing music?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Hi, I'm Adele.
...Pardon?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
What's this?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
What?
...I don't know.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Sure.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
So tell me... what happened here?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
So how's it going?
What did he sound like on the phone?
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Carrie... stop it.
Carrie, watch for Early.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
You were plenty hot.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
Could be.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
She can fuck?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Oh man, that's the best.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
Shit.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
It is right.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Man, this guy is really good.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I don't understand why you do that.
Shut up.
So really, it's good luck.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Casper, where is he?
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Yeah. Come on.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
You know what I want to do?
Because your a virgin?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
I'm sorry.
Miss, would I be prying?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Your a real philosopher.
You are being ripped open.
Did you bleed?
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Yep.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
No. I was just kidding.
Hello?
Where does everyone sleep?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Casual.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Morpheus.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You want me to what?
You still having a problem with this?
How is she?
Ready for round two?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
We'll find the evidence.
And -- what path is that?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Why not?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Just for that no hint today.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
By that time the game will be over.
It's me you want.  Not her.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
What's this?
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
What scars?
You might not have done it had you known.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
Feeling better?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Who told you that?
What is it, dad?
What about prints?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
Well?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I'm busy right now.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Kathy?
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
What have you come up with on the riddle?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
Answer the question.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Peter...
You're always in the middle of a match.
You have something you want to say?
I can check and call you back.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Are you one of the players?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
Do you?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
I'm not playing a game now.
I just don't want to fight with you.
Peter, you have to admit--
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Peter...
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Why?
This letter.  I've never opened it.
You're going to be late for your match.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Me too.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Where is the Fortress?
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
I can't reach her.
The spiral begins in the west.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Am I not worth returning to?
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I'm not hungry.
You've eaten nothing.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Can't I come, too?
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Food for crows.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Few have survived it.
But you would not stay with me.
She was not as beautiful.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Knowledge.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
It will not help.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Take...
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Come on, get down!
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Poor darling, and then?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
...Who sent you?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Do you recognize him?
What is it?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
I don't accept that.
What would you like us to do?
Mine.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
So what's the deal Maurice?
I know what you're getting at.
The new store?
There's no reason.
I want children.
From where?
Why?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
What's his story?
Red flag, man.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
What happened?
I'm walking there Kris.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
In a hospital.
... My father.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Do you want to fuck now?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
Don't run away.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
Thank you. What time is it?
How long have I been here?
Sera...
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Please!
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
How'd this happen?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Where have you been?
Don't hit me.
Why would I kill my husband?
I loved him!
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Why the hell not?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Why didn't you call me?
I'm sorry?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
After you went to all that trouble?
Good one.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Our group is full.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
You almost had me fooled.
I'm a bitch.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Here. You're gonna need this.
Picking out my wedding dress!
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
She's not!
And you know this for a fact?
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
What?
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Neither.
Amazing how?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
And I fully support that.
Now I am.
Thanks for the backup.
Where?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Hovering?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Fool's magic.
You go?  Not watch fun?
What?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You're magnificent.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
God protect me.
You... you're a beast!
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Like some vile toadstool.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
No more... please...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
Flozen foleva not good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No, wait... please... listen...
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Enough!
No... I... I need to rest.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
But... but, why?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
My God!  Look!
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Water doesn't burn...
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
A good day for singing...
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
We seek to undo the curse.
Well done, lad.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Oh, dear.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Who?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
He did run?
Tis the truth.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
I'm afraid it may storm.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Lili!  No!
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Pinching?  Where?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Not very precise directions.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
And charmed, of course.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
What do we do now?
What's she doing?
Praise be to God.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
You're with us in battle.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
Red.
I put him to work.
Why?  What do you mean?
Don't you have school?
I'm coming in.
We're not gonna do anything.
Not really.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Where are you?!
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Oh, yes.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
That would take weeks.
I've been here twenty years.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Sam?
You're here early today.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
Are you totally insane?!
I hate turkey.
When are you going to be back?
Where is it?
You're too fucking late.
I'm not even listening.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know parts of who you are.
I wish you had told me then.
Sun glasses?
Why wouldn't she leave?
You look better than ever.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
What kind of house?
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
It's okay.
Because Dad left?
What are you doing?
He never answers.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
Hey, hey!
Last time you were gone for a week!
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
What is it?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I'm married.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Are you going to kiss me?
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Where are the kids?
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
A night in the hole?
I'm talking about a haircut.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
She's alright, isn't she?
Married?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Start your job? What kind of job?
What?
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
You're soft.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
No, man. I want you to have it.
You know what I'm saying.
What's up, Ray?
You still got that map?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Don't mention it.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
No, I'm gonna kill him --
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
How about some steak sauce?
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
1932? That's like, that's like...
I can't take that, mama.
Lemonade?
What's going on here?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
What are you in for, Willie?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
We could create our own hell there.
No!
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
All these good people have totally been led astray.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
How come you're not older?
Where did you meet my father?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
So far, so good. Now what?
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Now everybody sit down.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Thanks.
Boogerland!
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Easy, Liberace.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
So I followed him...
Please. You got to.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
You think I'm a tourist?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
It's freezing my hands.
I think I'm floating.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Off limits.
How do you think we got here??!!
Where do you think we came from?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Why?
Why did you do that??!!
What's wrong, Available?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And now?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
About running, dying what?
Where did you get that?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
How do we know this is the right way?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Don't!
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
We can't. We're going back.
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
And Sanctuary?
What does that water do?
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Are you ready to put him in?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
I'm sorry.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Good... You up for a drive?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
You okay, man?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
No.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Hello.
Pete?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
You like it?
What's he do?
You all right?
You killed him.
Alice...
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Have you made any charges against him?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
Who is it?
Yeah, Mack?
Who is this man?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
No.
There's no other bedroom?
What's bothering you, Madison?
We've met before, haven't we?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Who's it from?
What the hell is going on?!
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Let's go home.
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
I told you to stay in the car!
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Suit yourself, champ.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Hello.
Who is this?
Okay.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
You want some company?
Why haven't you called me?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Where'd you come from?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Sheila... Stop...
All of it?
Yes, sir.
Not even a radio?
Fossils, huh?
A what?
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
The police?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Yeah. You know.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
I say, will you have a cigarette?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Well, it must have taken
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Please let me help you.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
You're lying, aren't you?
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
He's dead.
Porters?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
George, what do you think you're doing?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
What about the others?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where were you hiding?
A man whose life was empty!
Yes.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
What is it?
Why, he's speaking English.
You'll wait till you rot!
EXCUSE ME
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
The hell happened?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
You do?
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
It's a bug.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Now what?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Looks like a train ticket.
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Since how long?
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
How'd you know?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
What?
Take it.
Agatha...
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
-- but he didn't.
Just some guy... they found.
John?  What is it?
From where?  D.C.?
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
John --
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
We can't grab it...
Somewhere near the capital?
The mall?
What?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
If it's a question of authority.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
I won!
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
What the hell.
You're alive?
I forgive you...
Who are you?
You're not gonna kill me?
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
How do I even know which one has it?
John?
Oh, God, what did you do?
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Lamar, I found something.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
I don't have any sugar either.
No.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Not on me, sir.
Are you sure?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
He's great, right. Is he great?
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Hello.
Uncle Bobby?
I don't know.
No.
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Honey?
Oh my god. What happened?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
I feel weird asking him.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Goodbye, Bobby.
Get your hands off of her.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
So what do we do?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
How so?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
A million. Easy.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
How am I being shitty?
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Nice work.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I don't know.
Right here's fine.
It's ours.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
What exactly did they say?
How'd they know who you were?
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
So is this the drop?
He woulda told us right?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Calm down.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
So what do we do?
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
No. I'll wait here.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Cardiff Giant?
What's up, man.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Where's Spa.
Don't drag my ass into this --
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Ow, shit...
No, really, mate?
Come, now. You just got here.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Nah, man...
Is it nice?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know my pager number?
A lot of Persians?
That money is your per diem.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
No. I'll take a strega.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Keeps me out of the army.
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Yeah, got to do something about you.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Man, what do you want?
You ain't lying.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
I can't make out that shit.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
I can't.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Is the program ready?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
I just want to sit here and be still.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Let's cancel.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Why don't you just ask your question?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
And like a fool I believe it.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
I better not come in.
Did you hear me?!
Another one?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Well, all right, then.
That ain't bad.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
You want to be the head man?
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
What am I doing here?
A lot of people are looking for you.
Where does he live?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[How much do you want?]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
So how's business?
How long you staying, Crease?
You did something on impulse?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
You mean a misfire?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Not at all?
So you were unhappy?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You think too much?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
I like him, Mom.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
Bye, Mom.
Our child's safety is at stake.
It will be a hard break.
[I know this. Your point?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
He's not a cop killer.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Oh.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Ufa!
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
You got an elevator in this house?
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
You say something?
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
What time is it?
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Don't worry about it.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
It's loaded with what?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
So I'll die without a son.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
I said, is she Italian girl?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I don't like her.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
Hello, Ralph.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Okay.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Yes, O'Reilly?
Where?
Which hospital?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Miss you, Walt.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
You  must  open  me  up  again?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
Wisconsin.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore   House. You in the market Duke?
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Give us this day our daily...
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I think I heard about that.
Radar!
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
He only lasted one season.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
What's the matter?
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Our minds?
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
No, never in the slightest.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
The blonde dish.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Did you get it, too?
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh. Yeah.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Ted Sheldon.
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
You made it up.
What John Doe?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Hurry up, Pop.
Duets? But can we trust him?
What's the idea?
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
What's your name?
That's got nothing to do with it!
It's for Ann . . .
Flowers.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
What do you mean, too bad?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
No -- you can't do that.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Really?
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
What?!
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Anything on Korda so far?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
Open your shirt.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
You don't like New York?
You have to. It's a tradition.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Tell me what you need.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
You know the ten commandments?
What's the first commandment?
I'm just practicing my lying.
To run last?
Is it always like this?
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Is the hostage injured?
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
I worship you.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Yeah?
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Scottie, Scottie...
Hmm?
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
The car is part of the deal.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
What do you need?
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
It's okay.
You were right.
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
What?
He had access to the keys --
Try harder.
What is it?
A hotel?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Who did he digitize?
Not his style.
Insurance?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
And it meant something.
But you were with me.
I'm sorry.
Don't know what you're talking about.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Is this... food!
I can hardly walk...
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
Release the power WITH the power.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
... Not bad.
Here you go!  No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
SKULL!!
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
Simon says...
"Basically".
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Anybody see them?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
The goddamned bastards.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Boo-Boo.
When my money moves, I go with it.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Charlie!
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
You fellas got names?
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Meyer.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
I been thinkin'...
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
You boys carryin' pieces?
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
What the fuck does that mean?
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Where's the stiff?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Monkeybone?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Olive or eyeball?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
DEATH!!
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Death! Thank you!
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
At the moment, yes.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Sure. Why?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Hypnos?
Don't ask where I got it.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Where'd he go??
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Who told you we deal drugs?
So, what do you think?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
... What are they all doing there?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
But I was dusting.
He seemed quite taken with you.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
What's wrong?
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Where to?
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
You've never *seen* this contract.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Diz!
What!
That infernal phone!
Dinner, Hubert.
Otis!
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Oh--oh.
One minute! Just one minute!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Where were you?
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Will the Senator--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Oh, now--
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Just fine.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Is--is something the matter?
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
What?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
You mean--here?
Have you always had to--work?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Abigail.
Already? All these letters?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
What are you going to do?
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Jim!
You can't say *that* to--
Father--oh.
Mr. President...
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Order!
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Good morning.
Yes.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
But they did take place?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Oh, thank you!
Feel better now?
Tell me more about yourself.
What?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Now, what do you see?
There's Times Square.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
What did you mean by that?
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
In a day or so, I think.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Hello, Mary?
What's the matter, hon?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
With pay!
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
What's bothering you, huh?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
Ow! My foot's asleep!
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Yes, but you said
Who? Miss Dawson?
You try it.
We'll send for the police!
Newspaperman?
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
I can't find him.
Look!
How do you do.
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
I've got one for Cobb
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
That's funny. Why is that?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
I'm Chairman?
Why, it's an artistic institution
We provide opera.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Why not?
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Look, he's temperamental.
A what?
Uh-huh.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
What is your name?
Yes, sir.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Please!
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
But you do therapy?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
I have eighteen more minutes!
What's that?
What brought this on?
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
That's a lot of people all at once.
What do you want to know?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
What's wrong with her?
Do you think that's a good idea?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What'd you want?
What would you do?
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Is that when you split up?
And this is legitimate therapy?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
...How violated I feel?
I am irate!
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you think about it?
Oh.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Slash what?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Who else knows?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Did you carry a gun?
"Get to know your therapist."
At least you pulled yourself out...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
What about it?
And a birth certificate is enough?
Lily.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Let's make us even, shall we?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
C'mon, friend.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
You bastards!
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
Where are they taking him?
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
So who's the broad?
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
You know your history.
We're almost there.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Something like that.
Is he supposed to look like that?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
You...! YOU...!
Jonathan?
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
You lied to me!
Do you really think he'll show up?
Juicy?
Hey,... don't I know you?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Who's here!?
Um-hmm.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Our guests are waiting.
Atta, girl!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
No one will believe us.
Eat your mustard.
Yes!
Have you considered my offer?
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Stay away!
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
At the Frankenstein Center.
I'm going inside.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Oh don't start that again --
And it would be the right thing to do.
So what else has Superman got?
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
Maybe she's right.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Sounds good.
Maybe there was traffic.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Are you famous?
Wow.
It's on the television.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
It is?
Or Batman --
Don't crunch the leaves.
Do we have to?
And there's the Sphinx.
That was too close.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Yes -- who spoke up?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
About 5,000 troops.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
General Bonaparte?
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Bastia -- and you?
I haven't been there for three years.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Why are you carrying the dog?
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Were you in love with him?
Were you in love with any of them?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
What was there to tell?
Do you know what you're saying?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
You could hear them?
Can you give me a drink, please?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
And, where did you see my portrait?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
What did you say his name was?
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Well, let me in.
It's cool, but where's the water?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Who are you?
What you mean talk to her?
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Naw, I already ate.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
It's about to work, just come on.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Fuck, what's his name?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Who is that?
This you?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
So.
What's the matter?
Thanks a lot, Craig.
Yeah, air.
You make it sound so easy.
Wait.
Karla.
Most definitely.
You alright?
I don't play for no team.
What is it?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
That the big one, huh?
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Hey.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Get 'em, Craig!
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Where's Craig?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
Ezal!  Ezal!
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Where to, sir?
Business or pleasure?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
I appreciate that.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
Who did?
What?
What about the gun?
What...?
I killed you.
No.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
I have to do something.
I said I have to do something.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Cover your mouth.
Who?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Thanks for the shine.
Fuckin' A.
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
Close your eyes.
That one.
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
He never told about the money.
Where's your Mom?
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Uncle Birdie!
I'll light the lamp.
Where's Ruby?
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
What's wrong, Mother?
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
Pearl! You ain't --
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
John?
Story, honey? Why, what story?
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
Now: Where?
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
O no! Your turn!
John's bad.
Can I have my supper please?
Why, pray tell?
Mister Powell?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
How's that?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Do you want more children, Willa?
Answer me!
Mornin', ladies.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What's wrong, John?
What are you after them for?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
You okay?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
You believe in anything?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Yeah. So?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
How you plan to do that?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
You used me, daddy!
He's dangerous.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Right home after.
Mother, for petesakes.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Guess I should'n'a done it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
And then what happened?
No.
Nice to have a fire.
You feel better now, right?
Good evening, Anna.
What are you serving?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
No, that's not him...
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
We had to take it on account of the safe.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
We can call our ambassador.
Leon, my little boy.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
We don't want to be disturbed.
If you want to see us you must come later.
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
...and Kopalski.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Give me another double brandy.
You want me to go in there?
Don't hold that against me... please!
Business.
Yes!
You, please.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Suppress it.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
Yes, it is.
So that is your house?
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Is that customary?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
I have never heard one.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
It's nine o'clock.
No... go on.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech.
It's dead.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Did you win?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Good morning.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Where are they?
You leave me no choice.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Good morning, Comrade.
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
It's a code or something.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
This is not a joke, John!
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
We can't touch Hoover --
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
What about England?
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Sorry ...
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
That was civil war.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
We could leverage Helms.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
And me? ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
You'll win the nomination.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Where'd you find him?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
... give me a break, Mary.
But it was all we had.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
We got the press this time!
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
What's in there?
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
We lost ...
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
He looked old, didn't he?
Penny for your thoughts.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
Tomorrow.
Hiding what?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Some say you are, Rocky.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
How come're you doin that?
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
No money in his room there?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Well what would you call him.
He's real all right.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Who's he in trouble with then?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...You ride Winston.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
Maybe I'll go ridin.
...How'd you sleep?
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
It ain't even three years we been married.
No.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
What'd you give for that thing?
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Odessa.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
You can't afford one?
Promise?
What should I do?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
And where is that.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Yessir?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
What's this about?
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
What way would that be?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Is somethin' wrong?
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Call it.
Just call it.
November the 28th, last year.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Could I get another room.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Are you jackin' with me?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
It wasn't a woman.
A woman can write a check.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Great. Good. Content...
Who are these idiots?
Do you know who I am?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
No... what about your sister?
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
I beg your pardon?
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
I have... did it sound that bad?
So, call me when you --
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
...like the water purifiers?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
What're you doing here, Roy?
You're in serious danger!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Where you headed, Betty?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Your husband?!
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Huh?
The fuck you talking about?
Could you give us an example?
Like what?
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
That's right.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Joyce was screwing Del.
We should go.
Wesley...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
I see.  May I?
Jesus Christ!
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Waitaminute -
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Huh?!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
What do we do now, Everett?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Yeah, look at me.
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
What's his name again?
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
It's just a symbol, honey -
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's not my ring.
Yes, but honey -
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
A million dollars.
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Pete... I do apologize.
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
It's bona fide!
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
You... in the Navy?
Who gave you this idea?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Who's that?
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Good morning, girls.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
What's your name, boy?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
What did you call me?
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
What did you call me, Mayo?
Louder!
Yes I do!
You're sure it's okay?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Sid, there's no baby.
That was you guys, huh?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
What's the matter?
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
I'm looking for Sid.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
What?
No problem.
He said open it.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Me.  I am.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Are you okay?
That's your problem.
-- posed to mean?
Get the fuck away from me.
Fuck.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
She's never coming out.
'Bout four o'clock.
Somebody called you?
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
That's highly inappropriate.
Push that button for me, will you?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
No cars.  Feet are faster.
478...
Damn it!
Can't hear a thing.
What if they get in here?
Yeah.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Got him!
Do it.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
No...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
...Glad you came man.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Yes sir, I did.
We're working on that...
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Alone...
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
I saw... but...
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
You alright?
We'll all get out of here together.
This cool the heat off you any?
Rose?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Congratulations.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Am I one of that sort?
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
I know that.
Of course, I do.
Thank you.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Very well, let us move on to...
Sir?
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Do you see that, Colonel?
And the Governor?
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
How old are you?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Not held, just slowed down.
It is ended.
Goodbye, Francis.
Father?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
No-I guess not.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
Huh?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
Hey--they actually found the place!
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
It's Church.
Going to tell Ellie?
But--
I'm not climbing that.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
What are those for?
Doesn't look like they last long.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
And Buckaroo Banzai.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Thank you, Louis.
Getting there.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
Why don't I want to do this?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
I'm glad we got here in time.
If I had known --
It doesn't!
You?!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
A fool's errand.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
What's your name?
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Who makes all these?
Why are brothering with that?
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
What's that?
No.
Jack!
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
No, it's not.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
He's still breathing.
What happened here?
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
I know what you're doing.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Oh no?  Smell this.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
It will be an ascension.
Poppy, please --
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
You were never invited to my house.
Like Crazy Glue?
Sir, please try to hold still.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
When did you...?
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
You don't know?
What are these?
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Is something wrong?
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
How far can you stretch?
No cheese.
Susie... I...
What in the...?
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
God, what a fight that was.
You!  I remember you!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Indeed? How interesting.
May I use your telephone?
That's considerate of you.
Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
Will you step into the library?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Oh, is that so?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Look, I quit!
Yeah.
Right - for the first time this year.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
It has been alleged - yes
Why not?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Well, when are you quitting?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
All right, outside!
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
Yes.
That's a lovely dress.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
How is her family going to feel about it?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Okay.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
How far have you gotten?
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Did who?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
No.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Thanks. May I sit down?
I don't eat waffles.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Yes.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
But I
Found no skeletons?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Yes sir.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Mary Sue?
What?
It's okay. It's alright.
Thank you.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
Oh, hi ...
Where'd you get this?
You can't go out there.
I told you where I was.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
... Why?
It's six-thirty ...
I'm busy.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
But it could happen.
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
What do you mean!?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
What color is that hedge of yours?
You know him?
Who's that?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
What's wrong?
You're reading?
How come I'm still in black and white?
No. I baked them for you.
Keeps going ...
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
You want some berries?
What's going on?
Real rain?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Can I open it?
I like calling you David.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
What's wrong?
Do you have the lettuce?
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
It's beautiful.
Yeah. TV busted?
Free?
...yes I'm still on hold...
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
...please, I just don't want it....
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
You're so scared.
No.
No.
...just talking to you....
No.
Really?
It doesn't matter.
...yes...
Yes.
Me?
I know but I....how much is it?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
So you think you can?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Hello?
They're not open yet?
Do you know them.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
I saw a picture of you.
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Alright?
You see?
Is everything ok?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
There's a better place for us to eat.
Oh that's great.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Are you ok?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
No.
Your hand is bleeding.
The police are on their way.
No one will know your name.
You want her to call you Jack?
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I'll say whatever I want --
Sorry about that.
What's up?
Mhm.
Yeah.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Hey.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Yes.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Yes. Sorry.
Yes I am.
Seven o'clock.
I know.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
Hello?
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Are you ready?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
So...did my brother call you?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Marquis? Is that you?
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
Madeleine --
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
And --?
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
They can't be serious.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
He can't do that to me.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Go to hell!
Who's to say I did not?
Of course.
And --?
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
I'll do everything in my power --
As you say, Doctor.
As for the author... shoot him.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
Here it is; the last chapter.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
Most assuredly.
It's a long story, this one.
What have they done to you now?
Surely you've seen a man naked.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
...yes, I've got that bit...
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Good God, Marquise --
This is neither the time nor the place --
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
You're just scared.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
This picture--
Then you explain it to me?!
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Thank you for your time
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Hearst?
Nope.
But with compassion and insight--
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Oh for Christ's sake-
Yes.
Mank-
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
Sorry to disappoint.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
It doesn't have to be
How?
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Did I ever tell you about my father?
Mank!
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Oh God.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Very generous
To do what?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
This is an abomination There's no music and--
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Oh, no--
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
Sure. What is it?
You want me to do what?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Answer me when I talk to you.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
Say what you're gonna say.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Nah, she would never...
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
I did keep an eye...
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
What do you mean, "you"?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
I went out.
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Jake --
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
I said, let's go.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Name me a better photographer.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
-- until yesterday morning.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Jewelry?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
I'll send you some comic books.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Hello.
Jeff --
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
I wonder.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
One hundred and twenty-seven.
Ten here.
What about the rest?
Yes.
Something big going on somewhere?
Make the one you want.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Don't you ever have any problems?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What is it you're looking for?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
I have the whole weekend off.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Do you like it?
Well?
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
L. B. Jefferies.
Friend of yours?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
What you say your name was?
Any other entrance?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No.
Tell him why we moved here.
Mother--
You thought I was Mom?
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Will you let him tell it!
You're absolutely right!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Boy!
He has a knife.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Jim!
Come out come out wherever you are!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
I came here before.
Plato?
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
Why?
Here.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
I shot at one of them.
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
How!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Where's Dawson High School?
Yeah--why--
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
No--I was just--maybe--
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
Oh, Jim!
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
How many rooms do you think there are?
What?
Is he your friend?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Why?
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, you promised!
You promised me!
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Gabriel!
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
You need a COAT!
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
You motherfucker.
...maybe I die for Nick...
I thought we'd have a few more days.
No!
He working for them on this one?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
They've never done a robbery?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Get your own room, Ashley.
He wants to see your map.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
You... you... YOU --
Put him in the truck.
You what...
But you were saying you were...
So you could get with my sister.
So you could get down her chimney.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Where's she work?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
Be more specific.
What's her greatest fear?
You knew the place --
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
Got something to say to me, Nick?
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Ash?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Where the HELL did he go?
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I can't go back to Vegas...
What about the Powwow Safe?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
You want that for here or to go?
What the hell was that about --
You knew there were guns in here!
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Oh.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
Tell Ashley... I...
NO!!!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Without having them hit the alarms.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
How ya doin', Toothpick?
That I should've picked you up?
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
What's that?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
What the fuck are you talking about?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Why?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Dead.
I'm cool.
Want a smoke?
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
What's wrong with it?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Not these guys.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Anybody hurt?
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
And this is Helen Carter.
There's a nice boy.
They're stragglin'.
Coffee?
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Are we leaving?
I won't have you fighting over me.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Thanks for taking over.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
That's right.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
I've got eleven horses.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
You know what she asked me?
What did you come back for?
How's that?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
It isn't that --
Stop it -- stop it.
That something I shouldn't see?
What is it?
I figure we'll get along just fine.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Goodbye and thanks.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
I said let's go.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Good night, Miss Wells.
Then I know my alphabet.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
I found a picture of his wife.
Me, too. 101?
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
My favorite memory was when we --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
So, I guess I can go now.
You sure?
He's right. I should go first.
Ray, run faster.
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Cindy, let me...
I know, but I've been thinking --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Okay, I get the point.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Oh, right.
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Hanson, please.
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Both of them?
Noooo!!!
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Let me help you.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Professor!
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
I can do it myself.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
She's right. We should stick together.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
It's okay. I understand.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
What a bitch!
Mrs. Sutphin?
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Because it's the rules!
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Detectives, what is this about?
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Goodnight, honey.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Hello.
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Who is this?
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
So you do drink?
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
He killed people, Mom.
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
What is it, Betty?
I'll take this instead.
You scared?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
Why, Mary --
What did she want?
What were you talking about?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
The people at the restaurant?
 What have you done about Irving August?
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
But I'm not joking.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Please, Jacqueline.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
I have been at the library.
And you believe that?
If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Dr. Judd?
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I'm afraid not.
That makes it all the more difficult 
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
Because I have something very important to do.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
But he also wrote --
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
That was quick.
Do you have other things?
No, I think you look... fine.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, uh-huh.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
So what about kids?
You're what?
What?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Hi!
Are you in the middle of something?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
No.
What about sex?
This is just... so...
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Did you have sex before you were married?
So you do fantasize?
About who?
About me?
Can't.
Yes.
Subtlety?
If you were in love with me, would you?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Come on!!
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Yes. I just got busy.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Why?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
What visitor?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
He just asked me questions.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
It's a sun dress.
I was just trying to --
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
How did you find me?
And you ask questions, right?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Then what happened?
Hello.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I've got to get back to the office.
Who said I was jealous?
Hello.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Not for three-fifty.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
IBM.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Another kiss?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Want me to breathe deeply?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
So who changes?
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Yes?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
You got it!
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
When do I get to see Brad?
How did you come by this scenario?
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Care to indulge?
I'm not going, Janet.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
Mental instability?
I'd forgotten.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
F for...
F for...

Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
CRIMINAL
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
Why are you being so defensive?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
How's it hanging, Miles?
They're from both of us.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Is it chicken?
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Hiya.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
How would you rate this one?
Are you chewing gum?
We should have driven.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Perfect.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Have you no shame?
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
So what should I wear?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Look who's talking. You've been there.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Fucker hit into us.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Do you like them?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
We gotta go back.
Please, Miles, please.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Look at this!
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Well. That about does it.
Nice. Very nice.
I'm having the salmon.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, weird. But great.
What's the title?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
I had class.
Were you ever going to say anything?
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
You talked to Wendy?
Houdini's sick.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
I'm scared.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Five. The five longest.
Explain, act crazy?
No I'm not.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
How can you say that?
Do you feel comforted?
Should we turn off the lights?
This is going to do nothing.
Merrill!
I can feel air.
How do they know it's over?
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
Dad.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
What about Isabelle?
Did someone save me?
It's the strangest thing Father.
What about them?
And three weeks.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
I think we lost 'em.
Forget it.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
Where are we?
Kate?
Goodbye?
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Women?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
Daddy?
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Where's your brother?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
The jury saw it differently.
Hello, Rae.
Why come to me?
What makes you think I could?
He must be pretty good.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
The picture's dead.
Where is she?
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
There isn't one.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
She doesn't want pity.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Really?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Thank Simone for the tickets.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
You look so, so...
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
What?... What did you say?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
How will you do our love scenes?
Absolutely not!
You can't.
There's... a wall between you --
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
You have to see her.
Not like this --
-- We call them "vactors".
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
There was no other way.
Me too.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Okay, Dad.
One thing bothered me.
Good-night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Mr. Sayer...
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
It's a hotel.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
A star is...
Maybe he can.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Why, Malcolm?
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
No.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
You want to ask me a question?
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
What'd you write?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
When they get mad, it gets cold.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Something happened, didn't it?
You really look better.
Just help.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Communicate?
You know that accident up there?
Where is she?
What are you thinking, Momma?
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
What--
Stuttering--
'Course, it's none of my business.
See?
Witch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Suzie???
Dammit, Carl!!!!
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Come on --
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Gene.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
You're out of your mind, man.
So... what does it do?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
It's time to make amends.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Throw me one.
Down boy.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Name something.
What about Jeremiah?
Listen to me --
What is it?!!
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
What?
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
What's she see in that douchebag?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Looks like a chipmunk.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
What are you doing?
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
When one sees you they all see you.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
An existentialist.
So tell me about yourself.
Well?...
You have a great profile.
Seriously?!?
What the hell's going on?
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
What the hell are you doing?!?
Yeah.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
See ya, Bandit.
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Or in the slammer.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
How long's this gonna take?
Also boring.
What are you doin' now?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
Do I have a choice?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
You're coming up to the scale house.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Have any trouble getting here?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
Oh.
Five thou.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
Anything on the Swede?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Did he give you his name?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
You're sure?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Two of 'em?
I'm here, where's the car?
What happened?
Yeah, we've been through that.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
Do you want me to say I did it?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
That's probably him now...
Here. Sit.   Please.
Where's Israel?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
I wouldn't go that far.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
... Jesus... what for?
Shoot.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Why?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
What happened to Gibarian?
I want to hear your version.
Why would you let her to do that?
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
They come when you sleep.
What happened?
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
What happened to us, exactly?
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
He has a point.
What are you talking about?
Can you sleep?
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
You never said you wanted one.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
He won't do it.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
Snow, get up here, now.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
It's terrific Win.
Occasionally.
Straight ahead.
You live in Manhattan?
Would you pick one out, please?
You can touch me, I won't bite.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Claire?
So, this could be your last night, huh?
You asked.
I don't know you...
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
What a memory.
Claire!
So.
You still going away?
Keep what handy?
Tommy...!
Mike?
So how'd it go?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Why?
Let me drive...
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
What about when she identifies him?!
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Let my kid go.
What're we having?
How are things going, pal?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Shooting.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Flash, drop it--
I was there.
What's in there?
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
You get mugged or something?
Now tell me you love me.
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Would you cool it already?
You're making my life difficult.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Some prep school thing.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Well, no.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Hello, Liz.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Waldos.
Of course.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
I'm a photographer, remember?
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Creation? Or its opposite?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl!
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
There's only one pair left.
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
You can say that again!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
No, Animal.
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
You'll fix me up!
To the Brick Kremlin!
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
I'll open mine now.
You're crying, Animal.
May I have this dance, Miss?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
You off your rocker?
You could use a new one yourself.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
I'll make it five hundred!
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
You heard him.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Data?
What do you mean?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Is she still angry?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Really? What do you feel?
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, are you all right?
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Is there a problem?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
Status!
Tractor beam, aye!
Will we get another ship?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Response?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
David, I don't understand...
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott...
Mr. Scott?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Good shooting, Scotty.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
What happened...?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
See! That shimmering area.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Wait! Give me a chance --
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
I -- saw no future --
Yes, I was...
But -- why?
What must I do?
What about Spock?
So!  Speak!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
My Lord... what are your orders?
Sir, may I --
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
But the child --
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Why didn't you tell me?
What are you looking at?
Well?
Departing dark side, Regula.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Tactical!
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
She's not responding...
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
<u>WHY</u>?
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
It literally is Genesis...
What's she doing here?
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
I did not think so.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
How?
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Admiral on the bridge!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
We are clear and free to navigate.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
You lied.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Bones, stay here.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
That's crazy!
Oh, joy.
What did you say she was getting?
Wake up, man, wake up!
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
What's causing that!?
Can you isolate the wave?
How long?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
Go ahead. Stun me.
Can you protect us?
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Thanks.
Iowa.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
So. There we are.
Steady, now. We need your help.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Spock...?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Spock...
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
What is our condition?
Ready sir.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
With pleasure.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Father...?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Don't panic...
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
There are days.
A perfect moment?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
I have to go home now.
Can he breathe under water?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
She's stabilizing.
Incomplete, I might add.
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
You're not finished here?
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
What's inside that nebula cluster?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Deck five.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
You need a haircut, Commander.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
You haven't done that in a long time...
Why don't you try sitting up?
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Do you know what this is, Data?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
I have helm control.
What year is it?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
Where?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
Main bus...
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
What do you want?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
What are they doing?
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
I believe the operation is over.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Figures.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Specifically of...?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
This is fun...
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
It takes a lot of effort.
My God, what happened here?
Spoken by you?
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
From Starfleet?
Shields. Battle stations.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
Your friends are late...
What took you so long?
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Aft thrusters -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Who is "US?"
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
Spock, I'm really tired...
Where?
Are you dining on worms?
But I am not human. I am only -
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
You must have faith.
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
If you are logical.
Sir?
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Do you know who I am?
Brother. I cannot move.
Why?
Beverly, come in.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
He is very observant.
A bit less florid, Data.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
How can you be sure?
Yes.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
I'm going to miss you.
How can you be certain?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
I'm only half human.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.

Open a channel.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Deanna, on my mark.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
New Praetor?
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Sir --
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Sir?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Strength in numbers?
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
But she's not the Enterprise.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
We need to talk, just you and I.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Looking up at the stars.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
After you, Praetor.
In time, Jean Luc.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
Its too late.
Report!
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
The bond is broken.
No -- this is wasting time.
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Right in line with that burning tree.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
What can I do for you folks?
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
What do you do?
Recognize this?
It's real, George.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Clarify that.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
Mrs. Haydn...
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Please...
Please.
Dashboard.
Which way?
What?!
Minneapolis... good.
What?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Are you from up there? Space?
No gas.
What?
I...
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
No... The closest...
But I must go here.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
It's bad.
I like this music.
I am not a good singer.
Where are you going?
What are you saying?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
This is yours...
Where do you think you're going?
Tell the baby about me.
Help me!!
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Is it for real?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Where are you going?
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
I told you...
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
We can't let you do that.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You can't just... kill him.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
He has his uses too.
Maybe.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
Talk to me about costs, here.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Naw.  She won't call me.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Jesus.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
About what?
Nero.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
What's his name?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
What is it?
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Tell me.
There's a plus side?
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
I guess.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Besides that.
Testa?
No.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Who knows.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Yeah.
I've been looking for you.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Thanks for the ride.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
Look at this fellow... or this one.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
There are Agency regulations about this.
He's called a couple times.
Jesus.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
And nobody else can do that?
Hello?
You were right. He found me.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
It's quite advanced.
All the same killer?
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
Was it Zero?
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
Let's talk about Zero.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I don't...
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Are you calling Her?
I'm sorry?
Thanks.
Yeah.
Like the quiche?
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Like what?
Anything?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
The poor thing. Six years?
He's so sweet. He really said that?
A couple of high rollers like you?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
On the table.
You have to lay it on the table.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Who's your booking agent?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Hello?
Lorraine?
Yeah, hold on.
How are you doing?
Yeah.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Well that sucks.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
Why?
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Darwinism at its best.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
I got to at least try once.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
You want to talk about it?
Uuuuugh!
Then why won't she call...?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
You live in such a fantasy world...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
That's right.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas.
They're all skanks.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
You gotta do it.
Always.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Mikey's the big winner.
That was so demeaning...
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She likes you.
Oh... a Dorothy.
What was the part?
...So give me the fuckin part...
That was different.
I hear she's getting real fat.
You guys are such assholes.
How you guys doing?
We got the digits, baby.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
What the fuck..?
...against the computer.
It's on.
...shivering...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
You dick.
...Anaheim...
...Shut up, Sue...
The bear's got his claws back.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
...Okay, two...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
No.  You ask for too much.
Godfather.
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
You look terrif on the floor!
I'll think about it.
No.
You take care of your family?
This morning.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
What is this nonsense?
But you needed a drink first.
What miracles you do for strangers.
And now, what do you choose to do?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Barzini will move against you first.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Things went badly in Palermo?
You tell us about America.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Give them some money and send them home.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Is the hospital covered?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
What about McCluskey?
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Michael?
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
How can you be sure?
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
A million times.
Do you renounce Satan.
Do you wish to be baptized?
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Yeah.
Is he alive?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Uncanny!
Marge, you like everybody.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
He's drowning me!
Who's this?
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I met him in New York.
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Freddie?
Shoes too?
I've got plans!
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Why?
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Hello?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Hardly.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Okay.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Are you okay?
Dickie!
How long's he staying for?
Did he kill Freddie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Tom?
I found Dickie's rings.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
What?
You're kidding.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
And tomorrow?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
That's good, isn't it?
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Tom, are you okay?
Hello. What are you up to?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Was that Meredith?
Dickie Greenleaf?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
I don't remember the exact date.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
I don't know...
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
What kind of people?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
You know what you remind me of?
The singer?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Well... mostly...
Huh?
Hello, Travis.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
What taxi driver?
Try holding the match like this.
No, why?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Yeah.
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Huh?
What's your real name?
Why? Who are you?
I don't remember.
Do they drug you?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
Why?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
Got your license?
There's porno theatres for that.
So whatja do now?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
So I hear.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
I'm no cop.
Get it.
Well, I just, you know...
Real down.
Like do anything, you know.
Stick with Carla.
Maybe.  Not really.
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Limp dick?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
I believe you.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
What about you, Delly?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
How'd it go?
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
What.
Me too.
I do?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
City hall?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
What was that?
Do you have the...
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
My what?
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Here we are.
No wallet, huh?
Yes.
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Didn't you have any help?
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Ernie.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Luke... what time is it?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Not at all.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Is there a young Tim?
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
You hungry, son?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
I was wondering...
Thank you.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
How do you like our little hamlet?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
And what had you done?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
And the second?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Mother!
They haven't harmed anyone.
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Yes.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Young woman cut herself.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
A what?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
And certainly pretty.
How long have you known her?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
When?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
They're gone. The same pattern.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
They won't be.
No.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
That's the last of it.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Does this room look silly?
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Oh.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
What did you say?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
What are you? A policeman?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
What did it say?
Can't see a thing.
I'm sure.
Will I be seeing you again?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I'd still like to see you.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I have several jobs.
I do different things on different days.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
I think it's safe to get out now.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
You must be exhausted.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
You must leave this house.
I'm cold as ice.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
Yes, I suppose so.
We can't be sure of that.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Hear him?
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
I thought this was a school day.
It might be an interesting case.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
This is a gift.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
What did you hear?
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
You're not going to Gray.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
You think I'm crazy.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Where is it? This place?
Fuck! What do you want?
You killed her. I saw it.
Fucking Zombie.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
Are you ok?
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
They botched the execution.
But you, you've had them.
You want me to walk a straight line?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
What is it?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Hi Mom!
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
He gave these to you?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
No foolin'? Will you?
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
How does he explain that?
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
Well, we could--
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Oh -- hello--
Where are you going now?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Is it worth anything?
I don't like horror comics.
How do you like Santa Carla?
All day.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
All together?
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
We still going?
That's right.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Oh, no...
Of course not!
Max?  You men we're having company again?
... And stay outta here.
Thanks, Grandpa...
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
You didn't tell David?
You like Michael.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Where's Michael?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Not funny, Sam!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Ohmygod...
Not impressed, are you?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max... what are you talking about?
What's your name?
I'm Michael.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Then it's not too late for us...
This is kind of a cool place.
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Where these tracks headed?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
... It could have gotten to somebody...
What you doin'?
What?
Somebody broke in.
Let's open it.  Now...
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Where's the other half?
Torch them!!
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
I think so.
Neither will we.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
What's...
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
What if it doesn't come?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
We should sleep in shifts.
You hear that?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
Now how did you get hurt?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
We need your help.
Because you'll never die.
Yes...
Why did they built it?
This has to end.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
So you take their best...
It's spectacular...
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Well there's something new.
Alex, what is it?
Darling.
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Let them.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
How long ago?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
This is magnificent...
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
My father has gone to a better place.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
If I might explain, sir --
What did you do at night?
We'll see about that.
No, you're safe --
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
But... what about Starks?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Do I know you from somewhere?
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
What for?
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Beat] You bled to death.
Do you really believe me?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
I might not be able to.
Me, too.
What? What are you thinking?
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
Where are we going?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
I've been ok.
How you doin'?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
I don't understand.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
And how do you know that?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
I tried to kill my wife.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
Becker does? Are you sure?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Well, where are you from?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
You want a drink?
You like it?
You don't think that's crazy?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Have a good day at work today.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Alright.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
I am the great and powerful Oz...
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
What did ya do?
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Hey, peaches.
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Is this your car?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
In case of what?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Thelma!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
But you think he fools around.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
That's puttin' it mildly.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Holy shit.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
It won't work.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
What little dogs?
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
You do?
You awake?
Me too.  I feel awake.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
We've gone insane.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Louise!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Hi!
Where you goin'?
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Nah.
Well why don't you look her up?
Why not?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I don't know about this, Dom.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Dom? What are you?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Mary.
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
How about -- ?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Turn it up, Magda.
Urrggghh...
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
What are you doing?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh Christ... poor dog.
You bet.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
I see where you're going.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
I can live with those reflections.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
So who's the lucky guy?
What's a mook?
I don't watch the new ones.
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
What's up, Doc?
You don't think they're too big?
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
Can I pour you one?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
By the way, how's he doing?
What's that?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Please leave.
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Uh-huh.
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
The other thing is...
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Jesus...
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
That is correct.
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Secretary of Defense...
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Hello?
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Yeah.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
I see.
Mr. Clear Moon.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
What's this about?
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
I did.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
What'd she say?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
That's not solid.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Still after Jimmy?
Where was this?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Who did?
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
What?
X21, give me a 20.
Ray. X22.
Ray...
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
It isn't?
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
Two.
There you go with those moves again.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
How about what?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
I'm different.
Let's make it at eight.
No!
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
Food...and you...my F-14!
Lucky charm.
This is it, then.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
That's what you get flight pay for.
I want it back.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I know exactly what you mean.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Sir?
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
I know!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
What do you want?
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
How was it?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I'm pinned to the panel.
That's Kazanski.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
ON THE NOSE?
Need a hint?
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
I've seen this before.
Who's the hell is that?
Morning, Coogan.
I can take care of myself.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
I called your house.
What happened to number five?
What do you want?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
I'm with an very important client.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Two-headed monsters?
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
I'm listening.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Yeah.
What trip?
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a lock!  There!
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Let me go!
...You mean it?
And you believe him?
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
--I got a trip to Mars.
I love you.
Right.  Mars.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
...What?
I don't remember you.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Don't be ridiculous.
I said get out!
I thought you didn't like me.
So you dropped by to apologize?
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
He's lying.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
What reactor?!
Wait!
You guys all set?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Knock it off, Burt!
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Watch your ass, shithead.
Yeah...but no ties.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
"We"?
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
-- an angel dust dealer --
Where?
That DD-5.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
I embellished.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Afraid of what?
-- About what?
No. You tell me, Shu.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
'lo, Cecil.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Edward T. Dowd.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
What do you want?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Look. Mister --
Five years.
The phone company was broken up.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I'm nearly out.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
The stuff we got last night.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Well, where are you going?
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Can you tell me what their names were?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Where is the ring?
That would indicate that it's the future.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
No.
No.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
No.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
A blue rose.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Agent Desmond, it's...
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Take a look at this.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Laura?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
What'll it be?
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Laura, do you love me?
I've got to see you.
Oh, Laura.
You always hurt the ones you love.
No.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Laura.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I hate asparagus.
Where's Dad?
Dad.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Did you get this from your lover?
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
What did he find?
How good's your intelligence?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
You would not...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Neurology?
How is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Well, many reasons, actually...
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am on the staff of...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Yes.
I'm sorry...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
Thank you...
Thank you.
Kathy Price...
One hour.
A single hour.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I object, your Honor...
I changed my life today. What did you do?
What Hotel are you staying at?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
What are you going to do?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Another, Frank...?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
So what?
Today is Tuesday. What?
What happened, Joey...?
Yeah? How's our new witness?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
What are you doing in New York...?
Dr. Towler...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Hey, there - open up!
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Did it do you any good?
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Is that... machine...?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
How long was I out?
What was it like?
They've blocked it!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
The nightmares.
Can I read it?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
What if it isn't over?
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
What...happened?
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Holy...
Like the Genie in the bottle.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Now?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
There's still a way.
Make us proud.
Where's Mom?
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Albatross?
Where you going?
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
You know, I never had friends like this.
I thought this was your dream come true.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
You only hurt yourself you know?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Sorry to here it.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
Jesus.
I feel like I got you into this.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
No way!
My parents don't do it anymore.
Where are you from any way?
Yes, sir.
You all right?
Uh, huh.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
What?!  What's happening?!!
What's that?
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What?
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Do you have something to say?
What's it going to be?
I can't be sure.
They are much more than that, sir.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Y'all take American Express?
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
No... I don't think so, man.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
What happened on the charges?
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
In what capacity?
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Hey baby...
What brand'd she smoke?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
That don't seem fair.
Sailor?
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Huh?
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
They have, sugar.
Trust me on it.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
That you, Sail, honey?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Emily?
Mm.
He has a book.
He is. Take my word for it.
That was good.
Tripp?!
You stay there.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Who do you think it is?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
The hood jumper?
Such as.
Came to my senses.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Is that in my chart?
She told you about...
Vernon.
Hello?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Well...
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
How did I get here last night?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Colon cancer.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Kinship. And what's here?
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
It's warm.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
You're lying.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I'm not going with them.
Get out of here.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Hey.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
I got the message you called.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
And? Are you going to tell him?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Well...
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
I'm kidding. Hello?
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Sara.
Oh?
And what do you think you might have said?
And what did you say?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Listen, Antonia --
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Who's this ?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Oh?
Is it good?
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
Hardapple?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
There's so many...
Five years.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
Fucking Mariners.
What party?
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Nothing.
How does it sound?
Were you watching me?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Too much sun.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
The passionate one?
Are you taking your medication?
I'd keep away from him.
Have you seen Walter?
People have the right to know.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
What's her name?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
No.
It was just an idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
You don't like coming here, do you?
What are you afraid will happen?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Is that what you are angry about?
How long is this going to take?
Will I ever be normal?
I want to be normal!
Fuck you, Rosen!
You don't know!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Where are you?
How old are you and your sister?
A nap?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
Did you get an erection?
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
It's going to take time, Walter.
What?
Very weird.
What's weird about that?
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Are you?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Hey, that was... intense.
Tell me about it.
What's the worst thing you ever did?
So, what did you do?
Molested little girls?
Look, you can go now.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Depraved? My mistake.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
What was prison like?
I've changed.
You really believe that?
And what do you tell yourself now?
You're scared.
We should live together.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Don't do that.
You okay?
Okay so far.
Lord Almighty.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
I can't believe you let them do this!
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
He's got the shakes?
You see where it's coming in?
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hello, Brigman.
Virgil?
What's the matter with you?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
4800 feet.  It's official.
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
He can still make it.
What kind of light?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
Then how come you're not with him?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Are you feeling better?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Does it please you to say such things?
Then why do you say them?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
But where did you finally end up?
It's divine!
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
I'll stay here also.
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Are you the owner of this place?
Your mother?
Zuria?
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
No.
I can't say.
No.
I'm a blimp.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
I'm being punished.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
What do you mean?
Should you see a doctor?
For what?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Who?
Do you think he loves you?
You've been alone together?
And you like that?
From God.
Don't you know?
What's your real name?
Would you like some?
Why not?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
You have trouble sleeping?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
And you're unhappy.
What did you do?
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She tells you you're ugly?
Why?
And why am I here?
Of telling you.
How did you have a baby?
Why?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
And then what happened?
Hm hmm.
Who?
A crucifix.
For me to get sick in.
Which one?
Of what?
Who?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
So I could go to him.
Him.
I hate him.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Something they... that they overlooked.
Larry...
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
You were a smoker?
How did she hide it during the day?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
I believe Agnes is different.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
I've already told you what I thought.
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
Who?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
She has it now.
I'm only interested...
She is not a child.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
What?
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
And my permission?
Her spiritual health.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Why must he be anybody?
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Somebody told her.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
This is permission to take her apart.
Who knew she was pregnant?
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's enough.
Eight and two thirds.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Shurrup!
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
You don't think...
Leave them drums alone.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
I see you go to the night court.
I don't snore.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
Ringo!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
I don't think that bit's right.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Sorry.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What are you doing?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Clean though, isn't he?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Gie's a kiss!
Let's go and muck in.
What's he know?
Y'what?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Let's have you.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
You are.
You're a window rattler, son.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well!
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
What is he?
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Any rotation?
Gravity?
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Can we come up?
How do you feel, Dell?
I have recorded the transmission.
Unknown!  What do you mean?
<u>He</u> died.
What do you mean?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
It's really on there tight.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
Now we're in for it.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
<u>How</u>?
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
What do you mean, no?
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
Recognizable!  In that?
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Air lock?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
How?
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Where are we?
It's out of focus.
What the hell happened?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Would somebody fill me in?
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
We won't need it then.
Now what?
Now what?
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
That'll blow the ship up.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
Headache?  Dehydration?
What is it?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Minh...
Give or take.
Where is she?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Where're they headed?
When?
Deal.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Something spooking the rhinos?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
What the hell are you doing?
Wait.  Lost it.
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
They've changed their heading again.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
They knocked out the external feeds.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Six month stint on Datus.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
Do you believe him?
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
You have to...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
You take charge.
Hungry?
I don't think that's funny.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
You sat and talked until it was light...
Then say so.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
No, it's not.  It's for this.
We never met. That's why.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Just slipped your mind.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Bill...
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Then you're crazy.
Need any help?
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Addison-!
I will not calm down!
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Don't run away, Bill.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Find out.
Lemme fix you a drink.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
She works hard.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Late for what?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
It was for my report.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Hello, Miss Channing.
Not just that way. As a friend...
Mrs. Richards.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
Addison wants me to play it.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Right here.
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
She's just outside the door.
How much time have we?
How far to the station?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
How was the concert?
Margo, again...
That's on time for Margo.
What time is it?
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Well of all-
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Who's left out there?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
When you do, let me in on it.
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
That depends.
I don't think I could be.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Play it again.
"Liebestraum."
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
You get quick action, don't you?
I said I'm a dying man!
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--it was fine the way it was--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
July of '71.
--I'm trying--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
Were you eyebrow reading?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
I hate both parties.
Who'd you vote for?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
Nah.  Maybe.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
What's the matter?
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
Woodward?
What does it say?
--jeeeeeeesus--
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Five hundred; six maybe.
I think.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
You've really got to go.
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
But they both worked at the White House?
Right.
What happens when the baby comes?
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
--what do you think?--
We can't talk inside either?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
They are not my clients.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Talk about Segretti--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
Are you sure?
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
...go on, go on...
So?
More denunciations?
What else have you got?
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--no--
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
This.  Right now.
What are we gonna hear?
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
What's your middle name?
Come on!  I won't tell.
You don't like it?
What?  No I'm not.
Onions?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
You got it, stud.
No comment.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Give it to me!  Yes!
You're so big!
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Holy shit.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
You're not...busy?
Yes.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
You did it.
Uh...
Jim...
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
No, not again.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
That's my trick!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Like how?
About the other day...I've been thinking.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
You comfortable?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Feeling better, Oz?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
So does your tongue cramp up?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Here, babe.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Andy! Holy shit!
What about your glasses?
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
What makes you so sure this will work?
What the fuck!? You too!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
I know where he'll go.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
The ADM. Let's go.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
What's the problem?
Nothing's happening!
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Shit. I feel sick.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Now!
Why were you so late tonight
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Where is your home, Anya?
Noooo....
Is everyone all right?
You'll laugh.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Anya, wait!
Dmitri?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
See? The Princess is under there ...
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
I'll show you!
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
She does.
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
What do you mean, next?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Two minutes, Alvy.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Uh, you're driving a-
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
No, I got time.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Fifteen years, huh?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Okay?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Hey?
big subject with me, yeah.
And blind people, crippled...
That's the key question.
I know you've only known me a short while.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Yes, it is.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Uh-uh-why?
You're so sure about it.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Well, what is your definition of following?
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
M'hm.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Okay, okay. Okay.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
What-
Where are you going?
Tsch, a few.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Sixteen years ago.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Stop calling me Max.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
I have some very good memories there.
Oh.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
You all right?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
You fired the cleaning woman?
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
Yeah.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
You don't have any clothes on.
I'm not.
Oh.
Oh.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Never.
Thanks for coming.
Can I open it?
Directing suits you.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
And?
Oh.  You're them.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Are you my big hard hero?
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
It was fifteen seconds.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
We closed.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
We'll be fine.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
No.  Did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
In the kitchen.
Truce.
Not properly watered.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
It's not like this all the time.
What are you saying?
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I know.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Has she called?
Coffee?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes I did.
And I you.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
I'm a little nervous, so...
A little out of my element.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
And Ryan works at home.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
What am I, five?
Yes.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I don't need a drug.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Do you need anything else?
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Are you lovesick?
You're a shit.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Um.  Happy for you.
Panes?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
I trust you.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
I don't have a drug problem.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
General -- we have to talk sometime!
You're right!
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Water...water...
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
We're going to die!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
And only you can become a Queen?
Come on, Z.
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
Ask me why we're so successful.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
This the place?
Not there.  Under the mat.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
What did I tell you?
That makes me feel just terrible.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
Marry Christmas.
You all right? What's the matter?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
Your stomach?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
I am. Let me get the cards.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
What for?
You are?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Do I have to?
You sure you want to throw that card?
There's a call for you --
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Thank you.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
We're going to finish that gin game.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
How do you work it with the key?
Where are you going, Baxter?
I am?
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Yeah --
You like?  It's all yours.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Very clever.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
I dig.
Now you're being bright?
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Baxter?
No, no -- just had a little accident.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
You threatening me?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Want to tell me what happened?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Say, this is Snugsville.
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
What for?
How long has it been -- a month?
It's been hell.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
What do you think?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Where are you headed?
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
No -- absolutely not --
What unit were you with ?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
Chef.
Why they call you that?
A sauciere --
Who's he?
What'd he say?
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
You didn't like him.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Terminate ?
What -- happened here.
How did they know?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
Do you?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
Go away -- hide yourself.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
He'll kill us.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
What's this tiger shit?
The other one --
This boat's a mess.
Cognac?
So that's it.
What if I say no.
20   CONTINUED:  
23   CONTINUED:
102  CONTINUED:
Let's go.
113  CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!
39   CONTINUED:
Oh.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Stay here.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Desmond.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Surviving is what I know --
Been driving long?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
It was blown up with the plane.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Go easy.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
How was it talking to him?
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
How long has he been having problems?
Have they done blood tests on him?
I know. He's just the best.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
So what are you doing with a dog?
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
What needs clearing up?
So you'll be at work?
No... no thank you notes.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
And mean it...
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll never forget you said it.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Hello.
How you doing?
The two might go together.
What do you want, Melvin?
What do you want?
Grouchy?
Well...
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
What the heck are those for?
What the heck do you mean?
You changed the room around...
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
What?
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Which color was that?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Did you... do something to him?
Go away.
I brought you Chinese soup.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
You going to come talk to me or not?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
How do you write women so well?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
So you're practically finished, huh?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Uh, Fontella's
Not too good at small talk, eh?
What are you doing?
You can't --
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
Okay.
What are you doing?
What does that fucking mean?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Such language in front of a lady.
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Where have you been, Robert?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
I know what happened.
Um, five.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Bullshit.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
You're one of them, aren't you?
Someone hired both of you?
Forget it!
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
No.
With computers.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Women?  No... not really.
Why?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
About?
That's where he'll be.
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
In Costa Blanca.
What do you think he's doing?
You should knock.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Then, we wait.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Yes.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
When did it start?
That doesn't sound normal.
I waited another four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Electra --
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Of course, senor.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
So how's your work?
How to make a buck!
But we are underground?
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I've been saying that since we met.
Let's split.
So why didn't we?
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Red or white?
My God! What happened?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Damn!
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Yeah, no problem.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Good morning.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I don't want to get in trouble.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
But we could go to London and live in England.
I don't understand, it's your home?
They'll do it.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Will they free me?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Run into Josh?
You will wish you hadn't.
Why did you break into that particular building?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
What is it you want?
And the students?
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Sure!
When the hell did you write that?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
I don't want to go.
Come on Holly!
It's more than what you're worth.
Why are there still such headlines?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are quite sure it's secure?
So go dance.
'Bout what?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I told him to leave me alone.
Now it's okay?
I'm thinking.
Landon!
What the -- ?!
You think so.
What is that?
Looking for intelligent life?
You're not in a very good mood.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
You were great the other night.
It's a start.
What does that mean?!
She great or what?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
It's only 7:30.
What do you actually know with religion?
I might do it wrong.
Come on.
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
So what do you want to see?
Are you trying to seduce me?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
One of your secrets.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Help me live until I die?
Nope.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
I've talked to your father.
How're you doing?
I'll talk to your father.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You're marrying again.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
So what did we just make?
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
This is 1952....?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
What time does school start around here?
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
The sunrise? What for?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
Your line, George!
You have a name?
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Pro, the sun's out!
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
Professor? Professor Brown?
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
You answered the door!
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
I know.
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
There's no way of knowing.
Obviously!  
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
I'll catch up with you.
What'd they look like?
We did it, Ray.
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Hi.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Nothing.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
My stomach's growling.
Is that all there is to it?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Hi.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Okay, friend. Start running.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
You're a welcome sight...
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
Where're you goin'?
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Oh, my.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Stay here, I'll be back.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
What's his problem?
It's a spittin' image.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
I see.
Let him go.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Before what?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
What's that?
I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
...Huh? No, I'm 
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that 
...That's fine.
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Yeah, but 
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
...Your room does that too?
Barton. Are you all right?
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on 
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Sure, Charlie.
You'll be back?
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Yes sir.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Where were you tonight?
There's no smoking in this building.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
How's not smoking?
Yes.
I need a cigarette.
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
You did it for me.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
Did you leave the club with him?
I told you -- I quit.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
But you didn't hurt --
How do you know all this stuff about me?
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Aren't you going to thank me?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
You won't believe me.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
How'd you get in here?
No thanks.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Why not?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
I hate rugrats.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
How did he die?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
I don't know.
I don't think it's funny.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I'm not afraid of her.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
If she's telling  you the truth.
Are you kidding me?
She's a suspect.
How old was she when this happened?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Yes I did.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
When's your show?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
That was my favorite part!
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
These are great.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Who did this?  Who did this?
What do you mean?
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
A primate?
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Paint it out.
 In this corner?
Hey  Willie Mays.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
I don't really have any problems.
She's good.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
You do! You definitely do.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
You're back.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
Don't you think he's using you?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 
What's your name, man?
That's a beautiful name. French?
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
That one's for you.
You don't have any!!!
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Admiring your handiwork?
What're you really after?
Didn't I say that?
Pouring myself into my work.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
... What do we do?
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
What happened?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
... eight, seven...
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
I am as well as can be expected.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I love you, old man.
It's good to see you.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
No beauty...
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
You're not even listening to me.
That's gotta hurt.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
...A bat.
Letters in the alphabet.
How about, MR. E.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
He's home. I sent the signal.
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
So glad you could come.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
La'chiem.
Rinka.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Why do you do that?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
I need to be part of this.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
...or death.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
How'd you find us?
Yes?
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Look! Police!
How much do you weigh?
Please.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
Do you sail?
Odd desire for anyone.
What did you see?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Where does one man get all this junk?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Are they paying you for all this?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Yeeees?
And what did you say?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Ali?  What's wrong?
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
shhh...
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
Bye, Dad.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
But is she gonna be okay?
It is urgent, sir.
off the peg?
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Ow! These chips suck.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Beavis.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Really? I poop too much.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Does that say Xanax?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Cool, huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You got two seconds!
Who sent ya?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
You'll be rich!
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
She's ready.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Here's something.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What...?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
Did you get the paint?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Help vouchers?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Are you available?
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
God, you're anatomically correct!
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
Otho?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
Otho'll know what to do.
What do you think, honey?
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
What's wrong?
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Is this the key to the attic?
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
... Were you going somewhere?
... Oh? You've heard?
No more, Robert... No more needles...
... He walked off...
... Do you think we should look for him?
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Do you know Raphael?
Would you care to take it, sir?
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Chauncey!
Oh, I like that very much.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Do you like it?
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
... Sir?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
How long do we stay in here?
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
... I see.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
... How long have you been living here?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
You heard?
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
I can certainly understand that...
No! He's a real gardener!
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Thank you.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Now?
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Why aren't you at work?
How was it?
So how was it? What was he doing?
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
You were him last night, weren't you?
We?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
I know. I'm sorry...
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Mr. Juarez?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester. . .
Dr. Lester...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Emily Dickinson.
Why not?
Who told you?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
I've fallen in love.
You're glowing again.
Let him try.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
No.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I'm getting divorced.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
Ah.
When?
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
How do we do that?
Is there dancing?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'm getting better all the time.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Sleepy suddenly.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
YOU HURT ME.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
I want somethin' sweet.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
What you want?
They good whitefolks?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Back stiff?
Should I wake her?
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Mama let me help you.
She likes this dress...
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
The church!
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
You remember your price, Stamp?
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Leave off..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Hey!!
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Where'd she been?
Uh-huh.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
Sheesh.
What tied the room together, Dude?
What--
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Am I wrong?
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Yes, heh--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
No.  Here.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Yeah, but my-
A hundred.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Finder's fee?
Increases?
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
What the fuck are you--
So who--
Yeah, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Oh shit.  Walter.
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
Wooden bridge, huh?
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Who the fuck is that?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Huh?
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
Shit yeah!
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
Oh, shit.
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Fuckin' A.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Shit, sorry man.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Yeah, but--
I'm not--
Whatta we do about the Mex?
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What is it with you people and pain?
What was that?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Blade.
Each day is a little life.
You're hurting me.
It means "bloodbrother."
How does it look?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Your security's for shit, kid.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
What the fuck you doing?
Yes?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Stupidity.
Get in. Youre leaving.
Going somewhere?
Is something wrong, my friend?
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
Why?
You care about him, don't you?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
Whistler!
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
What do you mean?
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
What's she look like?
Yeah, so?
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Druid Hill Park.
--<u>myth</u>--
No.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Anna--
What?
You want me to scooch over next to you?
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
--now c'mon!
Nothing. I dunno--
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
Oh, Jesus, no--
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
Beer and weed is what I've got.
How'd you know they were--
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
Okay, a blur.
So lemme see it.
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
I don't believe this.
Never would've guessed.
What movies?
What I never could figure about the movie?
No fucking.
We should be so lucky.
What're you, crazy??
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
What the fuck--??
Yeah. Me too.
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
What?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Running a junk yard.
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
What?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Elly Kedward?
What?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
You gonna be alright?
--bullshit--
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Thanks, Meurice.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Where... where you going?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
...You all right?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...You leaving?
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Then what'd you come here for?
Now that don't make much sense.
...Anything else?
You want me to kill 'em.
...There's a big--
Yeah...
...Count it if you want.
Red Label.
That's not the point.
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
What day is it today, Angie?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Okay?
Is Sandy part of this?
Hello, baby.
Yes, but.
Can I feel 'em?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Bull.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Do you like that?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Falling.
Who is Don?
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
I want you to hurt me.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I'm glad you do.
Dorothy. no!
I'll call you.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
What else is new?. right?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Okay. okay.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Okay.
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Really?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Probably not. no. Why?
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Good to see you, son.
What time are visiting hours?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
No.
No. you're right.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
He comes over to study.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
On the plane.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
This is it for me.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Surprise.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
And I only deal with you?
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
What do you got there, Diego?
Twenty-six months.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Yeah, I'm out.
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
But you must.  It's the only way.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Are you comfortable with this?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Well, you know.  It's um...
Yeah, layaway.
Surprised to see me?
Mexico.
It's a family heirloom.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
George, you look terrible.
I know.
What are you going to do?
Just low.
You mad at me?
You're like your mother.  You love money.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
I meant every word of it.
How are you doing, George?
George.
Do I know you?
Why are you smiling?
Jesus Christ.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Alright.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
What are you doing here?
What?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
California, huh?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Holy shit, Dulli!
Are we good?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
What ... What must I decide?
With an unloaded pistol?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Read it.
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Are you ready, colonel?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
So she knew about his heart?
What induced it?
Then how did it get into his body?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Her name?
Who found him?
How long were you together?
Why not?
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
She was.
Did you suggest any?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Why does she come to you?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
October twenty-seventh.
What happened next?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
I've tried it.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Three fifteen.
P.M.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Hello?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
You and me -- making love.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
You were brilliant today.
What are you going you doing?
You killed him -- didn't you?
You don't need anybody.
What are they saying?
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
The witness will answer the question.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
If you want me to.
What's she like?
Humped
What's wrong?
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
I don't know.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Well, I can help.
How bizarre!
I thought everything WAS arranged.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Don't say that!
Not yet. You want to go?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Carolyn!
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Mind if I smoke?
Feeling better?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
You drink bug repellent?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
So what happened?
You must get lonely at times.
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
Okay. See you later.
It's Robert.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Can I help?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Why do you say that?
Uh-huh. And?
Sleep all right?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
I... What do you want?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
What about your husband?
You feeling better Franny?
What time is it?
Where you going?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Want anything special for dinner?
Betty.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
When did she decide this?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
Are you nuts?
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
You soundin' like the old man now.
That's what?
Looking to score?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
You got a nice crib here.
What else?  Money.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
What it will be.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
What else does she say?
The dead get out?
I can't.  Not yet.
I'm here.
Patrick, he's...
You got the cash?
Where is it?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
What the hell do you want?
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Nice rack.  How old is --
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
That's all we did, steal their ride.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
You shouldn't have hit me.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Where is it?
Caesar?  What is this?
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
She's doing the work herself.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
They were early.
They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?
It's impossible!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
You can't leave.
Fuck.
Shut up, Violet.
What?
We were in a car accident --
But everybody is all right.
Now that's teamwork.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Call me as soon as you get him.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
See?  We're for real.
This is a beautiful place.
Who?
So this is temporary for you?
'63 Chevy.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Okay, one drink.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
The redistribution of wealth.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Because it's the truth.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
What?
Yes.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Why?
Why?
Jesus, that's beautiful.
What if he doesn't run?
I was so afraid you ...
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Yes.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
Forget it.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Yes.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
You have your passport?
Sir, you waited on line.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
So what's in Paris?
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What does that mean?
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Okay, so...
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
-- just --
He's dead isn't he?
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
Oh, Jesus...
-- we'll tell them what happened --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
What?
What if it doesn't come back?
...your ducts?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Go away.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
Thanks very much Sam.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Long time no see!
You are late.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Remember how they used to stick out?
What?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Er ... no.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Tell me about Layton.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
So what are you going to do about her?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
And you're mine.
Say it was a mistake.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
You stupid bastard!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Stamped?
Where are you taking me?
No, really.
Look at that - right on time.
They'll be there waiting.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
A cheque.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Try next of kin.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
Can I forget it?
I know that.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
Lime, I need to use your computer
Mother? Is that you?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Hello ... hello ...
Yes?
I mean it fixed itself.
Now look what you've done to him.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Is she dying?
She asked me to pick her up.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I guess I'll be going.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Okay, what happened?
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Sure, sure, give go.
Is he going to be alright?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Not as good as Nino's.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
I hate vodka.
The family know?
Last show of the night.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Would you like to come in?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Where you going?
Whatja doing?
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Turn it off.
Don't push it, Larry.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Shit, shit, shit...
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
What did I do to you?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Yes.
Okay.
He excels at gratitude.
It's nice to see you.
That's your full name?
Eventually rising to...
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
Yes.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
Do others feel that you did well?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
What?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Let's go...
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
So who's the guy?
Okay.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Do it then.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Just when do you start, telling people?
Jane?
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
It's Aaron.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
Go ahead.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
If we could just eat first.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Hi.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
No.  Were you going to you?
So you like me, huh?
So what did you think?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
Then give me a minute...
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Don't you work here?
I'm almost ready -
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
What the hell's going on?
What did he do?
What's up, Walter?
Is it murdered man?
Where where...
May I please have another little kiss?
Goodbye.
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Here you go, enjoy.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Maybe so...
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
I wonder what his deal is.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Man this is heavy!
What did he say?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Dead Cat!
H-have a seat?
It's hot in here...
A show..how soon can we go?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Well I'm overjoyed.
It's like...you've turned on.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
I don't think so Mayolia.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
What's all the noise in here!
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I don't think this is gold.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Figures.
You're the guys from the movie!
Excellent.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Something like that.
What show is this?
Hey there.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
You broke up with my machine?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Thanks.
Dress, huh?  What for?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Bugs.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Everybody does.
None of your business.  God.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Oh, him.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Not a pressing issue.
Uh... gym.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Oh.  Sorry.
Put your head back.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
I'm curious, is all.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Interesting.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
I don't get it.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Pike.
What... are you?
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
The mark of the Coven.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
I can't believe they still ate it.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Buffy!
Cool!
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Oh, God.
The homelesses?
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
And the January Semi-formal --
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
How was that?
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
No.
Fundamentals?
I knew it--you're seducing me!
I'd like you to meet my father.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Don't tell anybody.
Your place or mine?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Crash...I want you.
He' s confused--
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Why baseball?
I don't know if I'd go that far.
Annie---
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
You a God damn witch?
Will that work for me?
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Why you shaking me off?
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
How come you don't like me?
What do I got?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Party without me.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was great, eh?
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
What's wrong?
No.
Sorry about last night.
Crash Davis?
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Step outside, pal.
No way.
She's playing with my mind.
He walked eighteen?!
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Look at yours.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
A powerful man.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
You got it.
Oh, good.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
I'll call you right back.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
When did this happen, honey?
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
Yeah.
Ohh!
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
What?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
No, no it's okay.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
You should say so.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
I just told you. She called me.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
How'd you know I was here?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
You've got to stop her.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
...position...
Why not make them happy?
This woman's an institution.
Okay. Just take it easy.
I-I'll do it.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Why do you need that much?
You can't make me stop caring...
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
Hello.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
How serious?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
Hi, Sam.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Fuck you.
I wouldn't -
Now you need approval from him to go home?
Don't you threaten me!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Okay, I'll -
Well...
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
This is not the way to treat people.
...worst possible time for me.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
Well, I... I never tried.
Yeah.
When I left here with the money...
...I got muscled on the street.
No, no? You didn't?
You know where she gets this from!
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yeah, that works out.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yes.
Fucker!
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
He's not here?
Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
And I mean... that's no good.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Are you sure?
Ace.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
What? What?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Get the fuck out of here.
You fucked with me for the last time!
...same outfit.
I'm always here for you.
Right.
He's sittin' by the phone -
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Hey, how you doin'? 
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Frankie!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Charlie M?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Hey! Oh!
Since when do you talk like that?
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
I know, but that's enough.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Yes, uh...
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
Women, huh?
We're waiting.
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
What's the catch?
What a "drag."
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Next time, call...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Okay, deal.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Maybe.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Who's on the phone?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
Will you two cut it out?
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
What's this?
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
How do we get back to the freeway?
I told you I should've cuffed him.
You never miss a trick.
You switched license plates?
That's your "rep."
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Any minute.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Do I know you?
And what're you whispering for?
Lady, try making some sense.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Hey drop it, okay?
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What bank?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Why tell me this?
Did you hear that click?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
What's your point?
I'm handling it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Twenty percent.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
Pass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
We're waiting on you.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Negative.
And not a nickel.
And then?
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
I can see the benefit in that.
How far off are you?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
So let's call this the usual.
He gave me a look.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Do you mean that?
You American?
How'd you guess?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
You old-fashioned?
Hi.
What was that all about?
Perform?
He's getting up.
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
As different as it's possible to be.
You want to know how I kissed him?
Do you miss him?
Why?
Can't leave me now.
Why?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Details, baby, details.
So I got it wrong, then.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
She's the thing you had to tell me.
She from Scotland too?
Do you like me even a little bit?
You said anything, Dil
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
Don't call me that --
Why?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Your soldier.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Why?
You like me now, Jimmy?
You do?
What's Fergus?
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
What was it?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Do you now.
You don't know that.
Tough work, that.
Leave her out of this.
She's nobody. She likes me.
Why?
Why do you want to do that for?
So it was you all the time.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Eat something, would you?
Thank you, handsome.
What's that?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No, what's the funny thing?
C'mere.
She your wife?
What the fuck am I doing here.
I got sent.
Best game in the world.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
She can't help it.
See if she's all right.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Don't.
When I was a child...
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Not here.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
Oh!
No -- I guess not.
What?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
What is it?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Ours.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Oh.
Carson?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Steal it how?
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Starting with his own.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
You can't.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
What are you doing?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Or Tex?
What's so illogical about that?
Hm?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Yes, I know.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Got you.
Reggie -- open the door.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
Are you going to listen?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Monsieur Flix -- ?
Yes.
The money is unimportant.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
He was a wealthy man?
About how wealthy would you say?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Did you?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Oh, la.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Peter Joshua.
Please, not on my account.
Is your husband with you?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Doing what?
En garde.
What are you doing in here?
Who said?
On the street where you live.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Who is it?
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Yeah? What's that?
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
Good.
Hi Jody.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
You're grounded Friday night!
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
It was a she.
No!
Is Jody still awake?
Well?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
I am.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You aren't going to the party?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Me? Why me?
What do you know about my father?
_ Your father raped someone?
Yes.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
Someone tried to kill me.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Mark invited me to the party.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
Are you O.K.?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I'm making you feel like meat?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Wait.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
What are you doing?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Maybe it won't stay in.

...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Where do you want this stuff?
...moron.
Oh.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
What did I say?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
Go on.
...town. 
...-er.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
Yeah, borrowed!

...-damn!
Ah, one of them's in the back.

Shut up.
Oh, shit.
 Nice job back there.
...waiting!
Oh, shit.
I think...
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
...ho!
Hang on!

 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
All right, let's go.
You're--?  What?!
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Come on!

Keep still.


...did you?
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
It won't even start half the time.
 Yeah.
How wonderful for you.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
A-And you  owe me...
Hey, just shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.

 All right.  Okay.
Arlo!

...-natic.
We!
Whoo!
What the hell?


Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
They'll meet you at the top.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
No.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...


...here.   Mason... 
You got a prob-...
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
...-lar.
Andrew...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
Brynner.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.

You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Of which we have more than enough.
What about these two?
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Richard Long.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Is this your establishment?
....-lene.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...should be right outside.
I want you to look at one another...
...to die for a country that's...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...

Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
Yeah?
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
Hit it...
Great.  All right...
It's not over, Brynner.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
And where are you going?
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
...-five.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...is a perfect hunter.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Mason.
Call an ambulance.
And what if it does?
What?  Say again, Ma-...
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
Mason.  Mason!
So you don't remember...
...public drunkenness....
...side!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
Gimme this god-...
 Talk to me.

Negative.  Negative.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
What for?
At my age, you tend to lose track...
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
What does this mean?
Haven't the faintest idea.
How do you do that?
What's that, Curly?
...No...
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Hello, Jake.
Thanks, Lou.
Congratulations.
Looking for someone.
I'd like to talk to him.
No. It was an accident.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
That's it?
Well, let's go.
Give you three minutes.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Would you like something to drink?
Iced tea.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
My husband.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
When was the last time?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
This morning.
What did he say?  What did he say?
Upstairs. Why?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
Let me handle that.
Walsh here?
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
The obituary column?
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
He never even kids about it.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I don't understand.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Have we ever met?
The water.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
All right, what's your husband's first name?
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He did or he didn't?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Neither do I.
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Now what can you see?
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Did you ever see her again? 
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Elena!...But when...
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
You're still beautiful...
My husband...you know him.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
Mr. Kane -
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Who else you been to see?
Sure, sure.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
We haven't heard from him.
I'm sure that's it. 
Let him finish, Charles.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I know that, Emily -
I know it is, Brad -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
I intend to find out.
Oh!!
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Ow!
Oh!
Where's the towel?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
At night?
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
You goin', Mom?
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Get Dr. Corey.
Raymond - 
Oh, yes, sir.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Yes?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
First of all - 
I'm drunk.
All right.
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
What check?
Mr. Leland, you were -
What's this?
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
I know, but -
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
How did you meet him?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Are you sure?
How long have you been smoking?
Beats me.
Fifty-five.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
Can I use the bathroom?
Why aren't there any lights?
You're kidding.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
No.
You're serious. You want to date again.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You work in a market, all right.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
With this guy locked in?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
What about Caitlin?
This is the last time I come to this place.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
That's easy to say from over here.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Well, he missed!
You open?
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
What smells like shoe polish?
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Eight and a half.
Allan Harris.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Empire.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
What's that?
I guess.
Yeah.
It would stand to reason, yes.
More or less.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
No.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Vermont?
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Number six.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
You were saying?
An embolism in a pool.
Broke his neck.
I can't fucking believe you!!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
What the fuck did you do that for?
Jesus!
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Really?
What did she say?
You're kidding.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
You're a snake.
Who eats cock?
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
This life?
Thirty-seven.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Get the fuck outta here already.
He's got those love handles.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
You calling me a liar?
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
The porno mags?
At least they weren't lit.
What were you doing?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
How many girls have you slept with?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
He requested this?
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
HOW MANY?
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
It was only a few times...
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
What did he say?
That doesn't sound metal.
Is he staying here?
He really wants to play metal?
I think the lady called it.
I do about three-fifty, four.
To an Asian design major.
Really?
Sure. How about the beach?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I beg your pardon!
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
I'm not sad.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I have first dibs.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Like hell you are!
Willam!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Glad you could drop in.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
I'm coming out!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
She's tough.
Two...
That's a virtue isn't it?
You can stop right there.
The winds are picking up.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Excuse me?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
What if he can't?
Let's be creative.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Nice view, huh?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
We might be able to go that way.
Pull it apart!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
What's your names?
On top of the peak.
Then where the fuck is!
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Oh, my God!
Get off my back, Qualen!
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
You got what we need?
No names, this is an open line!
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Appreciate it.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
My wife... Alex freezes.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Hullo.
Much better, thank you, sir.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
It's alright, thank you.
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
What do I want?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
I wanna be sick.
Let me get up.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
No, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Are you referring to the background score?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Yes?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
You're keen on music?
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Don't read it - sign it!
Pitiful rookerful...
Yeah... Pete the English.
D'you think we should do something?
Hullo, son, how are you?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
A deer?
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
I was with Max when he got the call.
It's nothing.
I'm standing right here.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
You're kidding me.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?  So?
...why is everything always about you...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Hello?
Why not?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Like what?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I think he's dead.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who's that?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Vincent?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Max?  What are you doing?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
You're going too fast.
What happened?
They said send you downstairs.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Look, I'm sorry --
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
You going to warn him?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You okay?
You want something to drink?
If my universe had a hub...
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
What are you doing?
Was that who I thought it was?
Shoot.
Please put it down.
He's why you punish yourself.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
You look great.
We're going to Queens?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
At a horse show.
Did you kill my father?!
Blue moon...
How did you know?
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
What's that?
Liza Sutton is dead.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
And you feel bad for it?
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
A dog.
I'm still listening.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Yes.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
That you come with me.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Peter sends his regards.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Ellie...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
What is it?  What's happened?
You...
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
Dr. Cullers?
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So who...?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
So.  What happens now?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Ellie.  Arroway.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
We could be together again --
But what about your research -- ?
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Someone tell me this is really happening.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Did you love him?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
I read your book.
What?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Yeah.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
We saw the broads.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Then how come it ain't done yet?
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
A cold drink? Okay?
That's my baby.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Where'd the road go?
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
One, two, three... 
You ain't man enough to wear them!
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
I can't, Andy.
You're fired.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
She's supposed to have it.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
How do you know that?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
But it's a different m.o.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
What happened to you?!
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
Yes.
You know how to use this?
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Just get out of your vehicle...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
It's none of my business anymore...
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
I like women like that!
What's Abba?
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
We could use a little help.
So what have we got?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Can you drive?
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
Maybe.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
Ruth's already taken him home.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I'm only looking out for you.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
Yeah?
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
What have you done with the ring?
Guess which hand.
We'll get caught.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
I do.
Tell me all.
Furnished?
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Something like that.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Silly?   Silly am I?
I guess we need to talk.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Yeah.
No.
Especially now.
No, you've done a perfect job.
You what?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Who?
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
A pass.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Hello?
Oui.
Where's your brother?
Hello?
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
But you were there?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Get that, will you?
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
All right, knock it off.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Hello?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
Maybe you should call the police.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
What room number?
There has to be.
They don't serve wine here.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
Give it to me, Sami.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
Yeah.
How do we know what room she's in?
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
You ever hear of jet lag?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Did she break your heart?
Why?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
What's this?
You're back!
Who are you?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
On guard!
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Do you know her?
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're not married, are you?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Please.
They forced me to marry!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Let's end this here.
What do you want?
Give it back!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
I don't take orders from anyone.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Don't send me back!
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
It's Jade Fox!
They're gone.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
You're welcome.
You look like a rock star without a job.
You gotta go now, I bet.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Cute nickname, don't you think?
What the hell are you?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
...necklace... pearls...
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
I've got him if you want him.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Are you okay?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Got a boyfriend back home?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
How's the water?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Need a lift?
How are you today?
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
That's none of your business.
I'm... I'm alright.
Sure. Have a good night.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Lighten up.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Good for you.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Where did you find those?
What was that?
What are you scared of?
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
What do I do then?
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
What are you doing?
I was just kidding.
Just a kiss, right?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Hi, mom.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Positive.
Yes!
Where is she?!
Pleased to meet you.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Sorry.
I'll think about it...
You would not believe what--
I'm at your service.
Who are you calling?
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Bad time?
Tell me all the details.
Oh come on. For her first time?
I'm not in the mood.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I thought we should celebrate.
Ronald?
Well done.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Not at all. What's wrong?
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
What do you want?
Right after we played backgammon.
What time is it?
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Oh, hello.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
The Farren house
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
What is it, Alice?
Where did you get it?
I thought you were with Amy.
That's the Farren house.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I got lots of presents.
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
Now Amy
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
Who are you?
I've wanted a friend.
It stands so still.
You?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
Because it can't. It's dead.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
I think she broke the skin.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Hey, did you get contacts?
So did you do it?
No, did you fuck him?
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
What did he say?
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
I've been here. What day is it?
Oh no.
Holy shit, I don't know.
DON'T call the police.
What the fuck are we going to do?
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
Hello?
I do development for TV movies.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
The Nielson's?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
Oh, it's nothing.
It's stupid.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I really gotta get going.
What are they for?
What's wrong?
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
Except Mark of course.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
No, I have a cat.
You can't believe this bullshit.
You want her sheets?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
You typed this report?
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Where are we going?
They didn't have faces.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
But...  How long has this been happening?
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
What's with her?
For a month.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
I'm not certain about...
Dave...
.. Nothing.
... what?
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Don't call the Vice President!
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Nobody's got clean kids.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Three years.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Uh-oh...
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
And who's gonna find out?
Will he be alright?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Gimme a quarter.
President vetoes works bill?
This is wrong, Alan!
You ever think back to how you started.
You're not?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
You bet.
You're leaving?
Where's home?
I really don't have much of an appetite.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
It was okay?
I know. I'm sorry...
Yeah.   He's a good man.
Hi.
I never thought I'd...
It could be fun.
Help me get him to the boat.
His madness....could be from shock.
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Tonight?
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
TONY....TONY....
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
It's been fired.
Tricks...Jesus...
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
Yeah.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Charlie...
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Where'd you find them?
What happened?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
But I love you.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
What is that?
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Very good, Mr._?
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Good god, boy! Yell!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
All right!  What'd she say?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Weird.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
So?
Come on, that's impossible.
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
How do we get out of here?
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
Where are my men?
Now look what you did!
What other bunch?
Noooo!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Like cattle...
What's the matter?
Looking good...
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
She's gone...
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
I mean...where is everbody?
What was that?
Someone's back there.
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I'll get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Here's to huntin'.
Damn right!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
That's new, isn't it?
I got delayed. I --
See, I'm going home.
No. None of that.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
You like to call me Linda now?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
How was huntin'?
Hey, Nick...
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
No?
Kind of. You didn't know?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
What kind of beer would you like?
What are you doing?
You seem... disturbed.
Playing?
You can do it, Sal.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
You think about it?
Hey, Nick?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
No way. No fucking way!
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Here, here! This is it!
No.
Where's Vince?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Funny guy.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You're working a partner on this.
Hello Wade.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Kill him... kill him.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Just great.
I drive.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
I'll inform dispatch.
How then?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
Why?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
What's this place?
You need anything else?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Wanna try?
You're not pregnant, are you?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Rip Van Winkle.
What's this?
You treat her nice.
Yeah.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You okay?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Hi.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
Who are these people?
Jabez -- ?
Gee -- that Fair --
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
But I like the new one better.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
What Grange?
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
Now run along, Daniel.
What's the matter with you?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Yes, why shouldn't it?
It's mine?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Oh!
Dan'l Webster?
The only one you missed -- is the President.
I think his leg is broken.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Mary--
What do you think of that, Jabez?
But I'm glad to be home again --
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Jabez -- Jabez!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
I want you to fix these fish!
My son ... what's the matter?
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
It is.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
You mean -- a jury trial?
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I can't be honest with them.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
What's happening?
The police...?
Where are you going?
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Nothing...
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
New York...
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
Three down, four to go --
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
Roy?  You still with us?
They way you drive, I can see why.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
What's going on?
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
So whatsa deal?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Jesus, you're the man!
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
So... that sure is something.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
So!  Sal is with you?
I gotta listen to it if they think...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah... yeah!
You try calling the police?
What kind of things, Leon?
You alone, or you got confederates?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
What?
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
The girl hostages.
Don't fuck with me ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
We're all set at Kennedy.
Hey... let him out!
What's the matter with you?
Howard, give him the keys...
Where's the back door?
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
Do you think we can turn it on?
Yeah.
Are you a lawyer?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
I used to, but I stopped.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Where's the money?
Goddamn women...
You mean that?
I never been up in a plane before.
What?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
What are you trying to pull?
Oh my God, mother!
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Of course not ...
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Okay.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Cool it, Choco.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
Something is going down. Something bad.
We are so fucked.
Not really.
We're late.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
How much?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
It's been about a year.
How long?
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Where did you sleep?
I hope the block is still standing.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Hurry up and get dressed.
No.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Nice!
...peanuts.
Jade, you're late.
This might take some time.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
It's dug.
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
C'mon, Sal.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
No.  What are you gonna do?
Mookie?
Before I get off work.
Shit!  I forgot.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
You talk to 'em.
You deaf or what?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
Yeah.
That's what you think?
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
I know this.
Mookie's OK.
Hey!  Watch it.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Pop asked you.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Take it easy, Pop.
You're it.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
HARRY? Are you okay?
What?
Okay.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
No, it's a treasure map.
H A R R Y...
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I will stop this car right now.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
You're it.
These are really cold, huh?
I don't know. Owwww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Hey, where did you come from?
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
A raft.
George Washington!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Well, I'm listening now.
I... found that rock.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Ready Lloyd?
Guys, this is much better.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
TURK, what are you doing here?
Why ith dat newth?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
What?
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
I am strong!
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
And, take some more pictures.
It's a surprise.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
What papers?
Are you going to kill her?
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Yes, Sire.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Is he....?
Man-carved steps.
Stop him yourself.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Liet?
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
It burns.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
... Many men have tried.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Bela, what happened?!
What's in the needle?
"It is my home."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
What are you doing?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Don't worry.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
You really think so?
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Wow.
I don't understand.
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Goddamn landlord.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
I like to think so.
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
What is happening?
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
I got married last night.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Did you find it boring?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
B-but it's our money --
Why... yes.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
What the heck is THIS?!!
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
What if I'm vomiting?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You know what would be great?
Ed, can I see you a second.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
Sure.
Yeah?!
Leave her be.
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Mr. Pekurny.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.

Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
What?
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Eddie? ...
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
How's Marcia? She all right?
I mean, that worked out.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
What happened?
Oh my god! On TV!
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
What does this mean?
I batted!
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
Why do it?
Ha!
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Really?
So...?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
It's not their fault.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
Kinda'.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Marcia's living with a singer?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
You brought the girl!
... Ray?
You don't recognize me.
Who is it?
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
What does that have to do with... ?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
What?
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
Mostly Tammy fans
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Tracy.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Yes?
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
So Tracy?
I want you to do something for me.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
What is it. Tammy?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
More this way.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Yep.
Right now?
Three twenty-five.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
Where 're you going?
Are you crazy?
Who put you up to this?
Hell, good luck!
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You dumbshit!
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
How's the left these days?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
That obvious, huh?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Look.  I want to see you again.
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
Did you talk to Exley?
I want to know about Exley.
In the morning.
Captain, what do you want?
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
How what, Wendell?
You know him?
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Why?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Dudley.
What?
You wanted to meet here?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
She's fine.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
What do you want to know?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Anything?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
I... No.
No.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Ed, I want confessions.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Something like that.
L.A.P.D.
I need to speak to you.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
Really?  What did White say?
I'm curious about you.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
On what evidence?
A sweet man.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
Not a word.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Pacific Coast Bell.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Really?  How?
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Um...who's that?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You knew the deal. No contact.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
Yes.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Wait. What do I do?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What if--
Jesus!
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
You're driving.
Fuckin-A.
Drive.
Same thing?
How?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Do you see anything you like?
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
What size?
I know, but--
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Your stuff?
For your wife?
Hey.
Bobby!
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Sorry.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
I know.
Good.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
Are you sure you're safe?
Is it over?
It's really over?
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
You don't know who the fuck--
And then what?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I gotta go.
I'm gonna fix it.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Listen--
What's his name?
Gentlemen--
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
She can't talk to you right now.
In your dreams.
Dad!
Can I talk to you a second?
Ssh!
My stuff's all over her apartment.
You think there was a connection to--
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
What about the tapes?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If they've looked at the video.
Yes?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it
How much did you pay?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
You sing.  All the time.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Will you please come in?
What do you hate most?
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Dance with me.
Why did you hate me?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
I was talking about the girl.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Why do they care about our maps?
I believe I'm rather late.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Where did you find that?
I think that's called looting.
Buon' giorno.
Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
What did you say?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Oh.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
This is Captain McGann.
That's a different dress.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
For my hair?
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
Whoa - give me a chance!
I was looking forward to this evening.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
What's happening?  Am I needed?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Certainly not.
Katharine!
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
This is wonderful!
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Or my wife's.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
Meaning--
We've got to catch him in the act.
You don't call, you don't write.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I can't?
You disappeared.
Are you...okay?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
For God's sake.
I know.
We going somewhere?
You want me to pick up a painting?
It's a fake.
We're going to die, aren't we...
Those are my clothes.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
You bought this for me?
Aren't we early?
To us. To the Mask.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
They moved it.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Oh my god, I thought--
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Got it.
So how long till we do this?
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Not for me.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
Hang on.
--You're a cop.
He looks familiar.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Right.
You look like George Washington.
It's too soon.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Where've you been?
250,000?
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
There's more than one?
Jesus.
How does someone get meningitis?
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Cause of the chromium.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.
Five million dollars?
I don't even know how much money that is.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
You never called me back.  I left messages.
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rsum, make an --
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
What are you doing here?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
So what made you think it was?
What medical records?
I don't get why they'd do that.
Then I don't get anything either.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
What do you mean?
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Hey.  I like working with you.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Someone's following me.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
When?  Where?
I wasn't gonna --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Yeah.  A real moron.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Yeah.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Which number do you want, George?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Great.
You're not nothing, Erin.
You are someone.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
More than you need me.
You already packed up your stuff?
They up?
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
There's something else, too.
What?
You're moving away?  When?
Dr. Paulsen?
Oh.  Oh.
He can do it.
Will he finish what he begins?
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks his concern.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Because of my father, I guess.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
Yes, Your Highness?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
That was no earthquake.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
That depends.  Where are we?
I was worried about you.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
What?
Someone's falling.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Where are you going?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Jabba the Hutt?
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
Price?  What do you mean?
What's in there?
Ben?  Ben?
My mind fills with so many images.
They're my friends.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Good God.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
Go easy, Stevie.
Humans?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Cuervo...?
It's so good to see you again.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
I need a favor.
I'm already dead.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Not you?
75% power.
Plissken...?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Where are they going?
Aw, come on, Snake.
I don't know about this thing.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
What are they?
The freeway.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Perceval, you have returned!
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
How? Where?
What book is that?
At your service, sir.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Hello?
Just five or six people.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
I'm gonna miss you.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Oh, I see.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Oh, she'd love it.
Good morning Madame.
Bastard! I will kill you.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Are you sure?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
He didn't mention?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh yeah, since when?
To begin with it could make things worse.
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Wanna drink.
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
Yes. He's already here.
Wait a minute you need two.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
I don't want it.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
She seemed fine.
Another one. Had your lunch?
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
You and Regan?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
I'm all right.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
It's possible. Possible however
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
...look down in pity...
Miss?
Is there someone inside you?
No.
Frankie.
What about tomorrow?
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Honey ...
What's wrong with them?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Piano.
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
What's the gig?
What's wrong with it?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Count it.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
What do you think?
You look awful.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
No, I mean it.
What's with Charlie?
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
That's what we agreed.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
You're getting cold feet about this.
What's the matter?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Where the hell is she?
Awe inspiring.
Get out of here!
You hit me.
See anything?
Something, huh?  All those bids.
November.  '71.
I thought we had separate rooms.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
Have some more wine, Frank.
All night?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
What the hell are you doing?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
A useless talent.
They were simple songs.
What do you mean?
Cancel, Frank.
We're not getting paid then.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Jack, you're on television.
Stay off it.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
How're your hands?
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
So what'd you think?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Actually, that's my stage name.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
What do you mean?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
So run a little longer.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Come on.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Virgins?
Go ahead.
I don't believe it.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
You're kidding me.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Huh?
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Forget it.
Can't sleep?
How's egghead?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
How do you do it? Every night?
I can keep the beat.
What'd I say?
You were good.
Nina?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Yeah... No.
What kind?
Yeah.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
How do you know?
Older than me.
Big piece or little?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
You mean if I get sick?
Fine work, Jon.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Nice-looking kid.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
Why would he need more?
Hey, bro ...
So?
What do you mean?
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
How is he?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
How's Loomis?
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Stay away from my family!
What -- what are you doing?
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Castor's escaped!
You merciless bastard!
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What happened to your big "assignment"?
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
What is with you tonight?
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Adelle?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Excuse me?
Rise...and...shine...!
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Very nice. What is it?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Got a minute, Jack?
How'd you know my name was Jack?
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
You just said everyone needs something.
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
Thats it?  Thats all I get?!  A glare?!
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
What kind of man does that!?
Where were you?
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Uh...that babys crying...
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You want the cake!?
Maybe I should wait...
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
Are you out of your mind?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Kate...
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Peter Lassiter...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Thats totally see through...
I found it!
How'd you know it was me?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Are you alright?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed? ... Sue?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
I'll be watching over you.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I though we went over this.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
They're ready for you, sir.
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Feeling better?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
What are you doing?
What's going on?
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Benes... What the devil happened?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Wish I knew why.
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
No need to get up --
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
But that isn't possible.
I've done all I could with the laser.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
What's that?
You said there was a quick way out!
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Tell them to take us out.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
There it is!
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
Any reserve air?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
That's it...
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
...Is this a fucking joke?
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Can I see your license and registration please?
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...Would it kill you to say something?
Unguent.
One of us pays the other for half.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Well, okay, it's -
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Yah.
...Yah, okay...
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Yah.
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Are you calling Stan?
lot. It's a limited -
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Ya see something down there, Chief?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
You look in his citation book?
...Geez.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
I'll fix ya some eggs.
...What can I get ya?
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Hello?
Yah?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Sorry - didn't copy.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
I love you, Margie.
Oh, my.
There's no one else here.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Is that your blood?
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
No, you can't die of insomnia.
You need to lighten up.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
And I saw you practicing this...
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
What are you doing here?
I don't know ...
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Make sure.
I think everything's okay here.
Uh ... nah.
Is that what you're calling it?
What did you say... ?
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Hello?
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Well, I have to file a claim...
What's that?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
How do you feel?
I know that.
Same here.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
Hemingway.  You?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
You get rid of her.
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Tyler...
I asked you what you studied.
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
This conversation...
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
Fuck you.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
Tyler...
Please...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
I'm doing this for us.
Abort the plan.
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Biology, mostly.
Animals.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
What did you see?
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
What?
Take a guess.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
You mean Alex Browning.
Whoa, nine months?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
"It?"
This place?!
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Most kids do, I guess.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Police are coming.
I'll remove him.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
Knock it off!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
What's that?
You okay?
What's this?
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's she saying?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
It's a guy in a cage.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You never been in one of those things.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Why'd they want us?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
I do?
Yes you can.
What was that?
John.  My name is John.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
Hello, John.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
I... You're not going to understand this.
Hello....congratulations.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
Huh-huh.
A list.
Now what?
Where -- ?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
The Little...
Him...?
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
But I gave it to you!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
You a fag too?
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
I'm sorry.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Just finish eating.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Sure you don't want anything?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
I don't make the rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Wasn't it, ladies?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Yeah... I guess so...
Maybe you better stay, then.
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
I'm talking to you, Tita!
Hello...
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
You had no inner feeling?
No, it isn't what I think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
Serious, that's what's important to you?
I have to talk to you.
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
No, I wouldn't.
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
Well...
You better hold onto your tongue!
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Who are you?
Yo.
Remember me, from the pool?
So watcha doin'?
What are you doin' here?
So you got a girl?
A play-ya.
So what you think of me?
Fa what?
Wha'?
They are?
I gotta go take a piss.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
I think by Twenty-two.
Who?
You sure?
My friend told me she lived around here.
No.
Where you know Amanda from?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
God I admire you.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Maybe tonight?
What? What are you talking about?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
This one's going to be even more fun.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
That's two.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Like when?
Jesus.
The two surfer boys?
You gonna nail the chief?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it.
Good evening.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
Right.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Sure you did.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Will you kill me?
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
Cute young thing, too.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
John who?
Damn, I thought I had that one.
I really should change.
Lunch...
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
Are you still in love with Alan?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Good point.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
I was afraid you'd say that.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
Don't worry, I can take it.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
One.
Where is she?
What did you want under the bed?
Fletch.
Two...
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
Fletch, you want an apology?
I was upset.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
You wish.
I do it for love.
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
How'd you get this from her?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Got those Vomit invites here...
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Zuzu, wake up...
Are you okay?
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Are you okay?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Who cares?  I got a case.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
The point?
Well, hello, Ford.
It doesn't have to be like this?
You'd said something about proof...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
How nice.
'Bye, Johnny...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You don't use shit?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
What?
What's your name, asshole?
What?
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
There'll be someone else.
It's beautiful.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
I got no music!
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
When ya go back on?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
The greaser with the blonde.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
No, I don't.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
You give him his drops?
I'm off.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Hey, bud.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Okay, start pedaling.
You ready?
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
29 years...?
You just burned the desk.
You sound...ground up...?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
When?
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
When?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you still there?
What?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Sull!  What the hell!
How you feeling?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Which means he probably knew her.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
He ain't our guy, John.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Who are you?
Sullivan?
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
No more... I can't!
You're all just jealous.
What're you gonna do?
What was that?
Why don't we go take a swim?
What're you doing?
Think you can figure it out?
What're you doin'?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Come on down!
What's this?
A hammock?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
What do you mean?
And, what about us?
What happened that night?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Are they following us?
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
What're you doing?
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
What?
It's all over.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
So what happened?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Yes!
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
Everything going okay?
Good night, beautiful.
She's beautiful.
What are you doing?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
How many times do you want to hear this?
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
But she might be in trouble...
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Time to check out the waiters.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
But I thought...
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You have no right...
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
Did you find Rennie?
You had me worried to death!
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Everything okay?
So, are you having fun yet?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
I've got the numbers.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Can he really take us home?
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
You have to call the police...
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
We must abandon.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
We're making too much of this.
He'll hate it.
Shoot him.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
She is kicking you out.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
And you've been extremely patient.
I am really, deeply sorry.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Life is good.
Who is it?
Where the hell are you?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
A grandmother. God bless you.
You're a family man, Frankie?
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
This could be it!
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
I hate the Mets.
What do you mean?
Yessiree, Bob.
Yes.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Yes.
What's good?
So does Elliot.
Endearing.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
But you're his friend.
Yes.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Oww!
Please! You're being foolish!
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
You're an ambitious man.
Who is that young man?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
Assuming we are in agreement?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
No?  What's keeping you?
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
We don't have the manpower.
From what budget?
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Good to see you're feeling better.
German.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
Call German.
We can't stay here.
Where?
Come on--we're taking off.
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
Will you be okay?
I have your samples ready.
Anything I've forgotten?
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
You can wear lifts.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Where?
Of course I think about it every day.
What <i>is</i> this place?
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
What do you add up to here?
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
We'll try again.
Hello, Doc.
Feel good?
It doesn't look like that.
What's Beynon got set up?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I didn't. I just waited.
Yeah.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
A man helped me open it...
There better be a guy with the
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
Texas is a big state.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You're full of ifs.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
Hope you get to where you're going.
All right. Shells?
Chicago.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
What do you have in mind?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Then you do it.
Drive.
Where we go in1?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
I got a nurse in mind.
I've got to stop.
Yes.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
What's it got to do with you?
I made a mistake.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Jack?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
What about?
Really.
How were things between you and Frank?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Why'd you see him so regular?
I call that regular.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Yes. I met him last year.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
He was here for four days.
And what was that?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Tell me about the girl.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Oh, what you doing now?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
How'd you know Albert?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Nowt.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
What happened to you, then?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
I'm staying with a friend.
Is he staying the night?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
You don't look it.
I'll call the police.
They bloody hurt me.
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
So shut up.
Do you want breakfast?
No chance of that.
You coming back?
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Scotch, please.
Three hundred altogether?
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You ever get 'em?
That's right?
Yes.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He's doing very well.
The nurses?
Starting up.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Yes.
You haven't talked to him.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
No.
Did you?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
What?  What?  The leads.
You...
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Me?
That's ridiculous.
I didn't ask to be.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
It is dead.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Were the leads...
A waste of time?  Why?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Will you excuse us please?
That's great.
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Would you come in here, please?
What about the other two?
...I only...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
I will close.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Now?  Now?
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Why?
Is that what you're saying?
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Mmm.
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
You robbed the office.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
The check's no good?
John: John:...my daughter...
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
When?
They took the leads?
Fuck you, Dave...
How was it...?
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Glad to meet you.
I wanted to speak with you about...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
Rick...
Monday.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
You don't count Saturday.
When did you write the check?
And when was that check cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
What's going on here?
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What are the police doing?
Fuckin' asshole.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Guess what the Machine did?
You just this morning...
What is this, your farewell speech?
You closed him yesterday.
Why do you have to go?
What position did you occupy?
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
What if we don't pay?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Then why do you come to me?
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Ready, Frankie.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Beautiful.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
Within the compound will be fine.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
He's not the same as when I met him.
Hello?
Rocco!
Goddamn it, where were you?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I asked about Fredo?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
They are everywhere!
Good.  Then you're staying.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Yeah, but don't worry.
No strings.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Does it feel like a boy?
I had no idea...
Where?
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
There are still things I have to do.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Says who?
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I want you to settle on their terms.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
On the phone?
He don't want to talk?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
He supports me.
I accept your generosity...
Thanks, doll.
Fuck you.
Sure.  I loved it.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
You ever been married, Hanna?
Then you're as single as I am.
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
No.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Did you kill anyone?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Does that surprise you?
I never thought you were.
What way might that be?
So we understand each other?
Sorry.  Not today.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
Everybody has stories to tell.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Is that --?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Storm's getting worse.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
No.  It won't do.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
You okay?
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
You coming, Boone?
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
She is horrible.
Does the yardman come today?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Yes?
You're serious.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
You didn't?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
How's the leg?
What about?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
A boost. A big boost ...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You'll leave -- ?
You have my word...
Not my girl anymore
What's this -- ?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
okay ...
You guys have any skills at all?
What color?
Forget that ...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
How's it going -- ?
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I know...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Whatcha got left ... ?
You goin' home?
No...
Hey, Kip ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
"About what?"
You?
You hear me?
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
Toby...
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Shit ...
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
How's it going?
"Mitch?"
So I was replaced by Mitch?
On account of Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
What are you doing... ?
Tell me...
Is he still working here ?
You need him...
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
Henry.  Wake up.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Watch this.
I better call again.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
What happened to you?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Did he say what they're asking him about?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
He didn't call?
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
What do we got?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
Is that true?
--That isn't funny--
WILL!
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Some other guy?
What'd you say about me?
What is it?
You're in a safe place, Will.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
What's that?
--that?--
Shall we start the, uh...
I told you to cooperate with these people.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Then don't set up any more meetings.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
What are you smiling at?
Will.
Yes.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
Good to see you.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
Can we do it at my office?
Seems like it's going well.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Oh, come on, Sean--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Do you know when you'll be back?
About thirty million to one.
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
You're right. I know.
Yeah, I read those.
What does?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Watch your mouth.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Yeah? You got a lady now?
My wife's dead.
Why not?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
Gerry says the meeting went well.
They're all dead.
Don't give me you line of shit.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
I been there. I played my hand.
Don't fuck with me.
That's what you want?
Good for you. Congratulations.
I just want you to know, Sean...
Yeah?
I bet you have a great family.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
Promise?
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
Come with me to California.
I want you to come with me.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Then what are you afraid of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Yes, I do, Will.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
I didn't see nothin'.
How many men?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Government.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
No, I never. What?
They're all gone--or dead.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
Been doin' a job?
I stay in my own yard.
I didn't mean nothing.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
What's the matter, Grampa?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
We gonna live here?
Anybody ask anything?
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
That!
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Was Granma bad?
How's it feel, Tommy?
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Tommy?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
Here we go!
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Please don't.
Yes, sir.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Remember high school?
Bob...
Jesus...
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Tell me about yourself.
What's your business?
Are you going to the reunion?
It's always the little things.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Which would you rather...?
Not the other way around...?
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
You went to school with these people.
How do you know?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
No deal.
Is that right?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Wait a minute--
You're wrong. Look at his face.
Enough?
What's it look like?
You haven't looked at the dossier.
You have.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
I have to get my head back into my work.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Shit.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Why didn't it work out?
Ever think of moving there full time?
You missed a button.
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
I'll come.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Nothing.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
What did you say?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
David?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
Aw... that's so sweet.
You've got to stop doing that?
You've already made arrangements!?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
What if she doesn't want to go?
And you think it's best if I don't come.
When are you coming home?
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
No. I am a "tubab."
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
It's so cruel.
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
You don't seem to upset?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
I don't believe it.
Isn't it like, obvious?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Hey, darlin'.
Long enough.
Shit!
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Who's that?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Did you talk to him?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Up all night again, huh?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Crash Override.
Two days.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
I'm Crash Override.
Shit!!
Alright, so what have we got?
Oh, wow, she's great.
You look good in a dress.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
What? whatwhatwhat?
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Just one moment.
What's going on?
Who's that?
Brady!
Shit!
An accident?
Mom, please
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
We should call the fire department.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Four plus Myers.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Who you calling?
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Sure it does.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
What?
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
You won't look pushy.
Get the outside shutters.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
When he makes that call.
Something?
This is starting to spook me.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Thank you.
What time?
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Annie, was that you?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Probably Mister Riddle.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
You locked yourself in.
I wonder where they went.
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Jesus!
Sure...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Is Annie around?
Okay. Later.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
Not any more.
Right.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
I've given them his profile.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
It means... I see.
What did he say?
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
That's disgusting!
Well, I live downtown.
You're joking.
But I'm seeing him.
Mm-hm.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
You're Holly.
It's really sad.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
We could...we could do that.
Mm-hm.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
And it's just in one ear?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Hi.
How about you?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
No!  No...
Yes.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
Page a hundred and twelve.
How's everything?
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Elliot!  Don't!
Oh!
I was looking for you.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
But it hasn't been forever. 
Lee...
She has all the cooking talent.
Why not?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I didn't say that.
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
What are you going to use for money?!
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Look at this guy.
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
You're just realizing this now?
Yeah.  What?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Hi!  Hi!
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Oh!
That's really nice!
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Mh-hm.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Ohh?
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Ouch!
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Hey, hi!
Oh, gosh.
Good.
Hey, what's the matter?
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
I was so bored!
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
You look wonderful.
People change...you know.
You're okay, though, huh?
Right.
Oh, God!
Oh, wow!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
When'd you get here?
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Dad...
Boy...Holly...Holly.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Uh-huh.
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
...<u>please</u>...
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
We could skip the Gavotte.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.

Why did he come back?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
...sir...?
He escaped...
What do you want me to do?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
...they're from Baltimore....
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
He is...?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
...unmarked hundreds....
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...

I'm an orphan.

It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
And you let her get away.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.

The girl needs help.

I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
What was it.  What was it, honey?
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
"Because we don't have any money."
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Ask me when we get home.
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Hello....?
I want the money.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....

Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...

<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Yes.
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
For approval.

You want some <u>advice</u>.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
...sir...?
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Freeze!  You're busted!
No, they're not from Wendy.

Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Hey.
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
Do you really not believe in God?
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.

So, are you a cheerleader?
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
I was talking with someone!
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
Guess who?
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
I said I was sorry.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
What are you doing?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
And your worst enemy.
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
Is it sleeping, dude?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
 Got an A, Mum!
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
What does old Stew want?
Who cares!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
You have to let me go!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
Him.
Let's go overseas . . .
Just a couple more . . .
I'm coming with you.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Isn't it beautiful!
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Who's Allison?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Never to put you in my will.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Poor Trevor.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Wait... what the hell is this...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
You okay?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Nothin'.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
You!
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Here.  Get off here.
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
Ticket!  What's going on?
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
So where are all your toys?
Where are these toys of yours?
Any particular brand?
-- hospital.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
I should.
Right.
You must value your independence.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
Have you just plain asked him?
He doesn't have a temperature.
Where'd he go?
Neil, calm down.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
Did you hear that?
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Do you remember who gave us this?
How long does it have to be a new house?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
He wants to see me!
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
That's not the case.
Oh God.
Let's follow 'em.
Are we gonna buy this house?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Promise?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
This ties in with Nash.
He had to come from somewhere.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Sing.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
Maybe myself.
As friends -- always as friends.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
What are we doing here?
Yes.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Leaving?  For how long?
Yes.  How did you know?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
If it's good advice.
Where did you get it?
You're hurt.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
Where will you go now?
He's in there!
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
What will you do?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Jen?  Are you all right?
The car.  All you want is the car?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
Jesus.  What is this?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
It's over.  We have to give up.
You with the cops?
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
That you, Talley?
We been through that.  Forget it.
We can take it with us.
The cops are comin'!
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
You got something to say?
You have his address?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
How did you get this number?
What do you want?
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
We can't carry him.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
Smith!  Wake up!
Where are they?
He didn't say.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Chief, base.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
It's right in front of us.
It's mine.  Talley.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
How about you and your sister?
What do you want me to do?
Are the disks still in your room?
Who are you?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Anything. Strong.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
He did.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Your police are at the gate?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
We are better here.
You are a marked man.
I led no massacres.
Very good.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Let's go.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
The fog is too heavy, sir.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Perfect timing.
You are the manager?
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
What do you want?
The commander is not here.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Oh, my God!
This won't do.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
You could leave, Paul.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
It was substantial.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Paul, are you there?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
What are you playing here, Price?
Melissa!
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
Oh. Jesus.
Uhhhh...
Oh, Jesus....
-- the stained glass --
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Good point.
Don't think it's even an issue.
Where did it go?
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
You think this is fucking funny??
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
He was right! Pritchett was right!
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
What is it??
Fascinated.
Please! I need your help.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Rewind that.
Then who did??
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
And you think it's in there?
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
For the love of God....please...?
Town records are coming up now.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
By freeing them.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
She's down...
My angel!
Are we leaving mommy?
What about all my other stuff?
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Help me!  Please!!!
Good night Angel...
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
What's the matter?
What will Aubrey think?
God rest her soul.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
Aubrey!
Maura, what is this!
You're bleeding.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Keep talking!
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
There's something through that wall!
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Something bad.
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
What?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
Every day.
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
What am I looking for?
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Oh, I don't ...
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Really?
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
The security's actually not that severe.
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Alex!
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
Did I miss anything?
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Count of three?
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
I'm going to find out.
Oh, you read that.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
Way to go, Anna.
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Don't be stupid...they...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
...Hello?
Ol' satchel-butt...
What a horrible little person.
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
...You know! For kids!
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Oh, Norville --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Now, Amy --
...You son of a --
As a three-dollar bill.
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Ya know, entry level!
How long've you been down here?
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
My pleasure, sir.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Yessir.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Hello, Niagara.
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
Good morning, miss.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
She can never be cured?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
I wish I hadn't heard --
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
Can't I take it for you?
Why was the maid crying?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
I wanted to help you.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Good night.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Dinner in ten minutes.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
I'm not surprised.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
I'm fine dad.
Anyone special? You know...
About?
See you.
A prior engagement overcame me.
Talking to me, dad?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
It's what?
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Please don't.
I used to know how to cook.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
How can you do that man?
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Maybe you should have just a half.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Geometry?
Hello, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
It feels warm.
I love you.
I don't know. How do I know?
Just after Leland Street.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
My partner...
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
Not really.
What are you doing here?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
What happened at that signing?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
Randy Stetz?
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
He's asking everybody questions.
He's just rattling your cage.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Will.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
My arm!
Thought you might find that.
Down at the station?
I suppose.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
What about him?
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Monstrous.
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
We want no quarrel with him.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Laudanum!
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
You know her?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
He can protect us, Claudia.
What do you want from me?
Diane!!!!
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Did I hear a yes?
You're sure?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Take him.
What have I done?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Why do you do this Lestat?
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
I have to go now Lestat...
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Lestat escaped the fire!
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
You promise to care for her then?
What can I do for you?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Your what?
Listen to me. He's here.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
There's nothing between Will and me.
I'm the King of the World.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
You get any sleep at all?
Julie...
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Yeah.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Julie? What's wrong?
What do you mean, Julie?
I trusted you.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
Pretty cool bar.
You think that's a good place to hide?
To a great weekend --
Come on, it'll be fun.
Well, I'm in school and --
Can't talk right now.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
Take this.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
We will see who is the first to die.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Good night, Oliver.
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
What are you doing?
I felt he did not like me.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
What if he is?
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Your daughter is ill.
This girl --
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" -
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
George . . .
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Go through with what?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
No.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Thank you very much.
What's that?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Hi, Daddy.
What?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
She's swell.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Oh . . .
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Yes, you bet.
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Well, no younger than I was.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Hello, George, how are you?
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
What gives?
George, can I see you for a second?
Violet Bick!
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Some other time, George.
Hello.
Why didn't you call me?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Now look, did you buy anything?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Pop!
Made up your mind yet?
Too young or too old?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no.
Ouch!
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Come on, you guys.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Don't!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Shut up.
The lighthouse?
What is it?
Where're we going?
We're carrying weight.
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
I don't know.
You coming up on him?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
I can't let you take her out.
You're too close.  Back off.
Where to?
You stay here a minute.
Pop....
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Mike?  Is that you?
Dad, I'm sorry....
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
There is nothing to discuss.
The whale's mouth?
Do you?
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Let's get the kid home.
Sean's awake.
Mrs. Silvera?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
No.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Bullshit.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Yeah?  Then what?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Can I go with you today?
Hang on!
Is that me?
You're not going out right away, are you?
Maybe it's gone.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Come on back up here!
But first, a little juice....
Mmmmmm.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
It'll be fun, come on!
Faster!  Faster!
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Heading back?
Not tonight.
They're turning around.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
I want to go with you!
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, Doctor.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
What's your plan, Brody?
It's Miller time!
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Well, not much longer to go.
And what else is bothering you?
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Damn it!
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Where are you going?
How the hell did it get in here?
Fine piece of engineering.
Kathryn...
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
You want me to stay?
They said you'd be here.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
No, we'll go through here.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Honey, what is it?
Yes, you can.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
You don't have to prove anything.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
I want that shark alive.
Let's hope he knows that.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Some miss all their shots.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
I think they'll come out now.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
I'm a water-skier.
Sure am.
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
Let's go, let's go!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Gotta sneeze.
Did you see that?
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
The world's southern most reaches.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
How'd you do in school?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Sure.
Can I make sandwiches...?
Like mother, like son....
How come it's my responsibility?
What the hell are we arguing about?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Close the door.
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
It'll grow on you.
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
You want to try your hand at something...?
That....
We don't want any....
In a minute....
I never....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
You're having a good time....
It got him....
Can you just go off...?
Flies the plane....
Depends on where you want to go....
What are you doing?
The kind with an umbrella in it....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
I hope she's a good sailor....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Keep it steady....
Can't this thing go any faster?
How many...?
You tagging them...?
I know how to tag a damn conch....
I stuck them on, man....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
I don't know shit about electronics....
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
You getting a reading on them?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Shit....
You told me what?
What the hell are you doing?
Jake.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
That bad, huh?
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
What do you think?
Yeah, he can go ...
There's nothing in the files?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
What do you mean?
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Because I dislike her too much ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Where is everyone?
Why?
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Where's your watch?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
What if we need a back up?
What is that?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
What do you want me to do, Chief?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
The elevator wasn't working?
Me?
Did Amber have a dog?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
Are you married?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Why?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
When did John divorce?
What was she like?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
He's happy, darlin ..
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
You can drive down there, Sir ..
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Well, no you didn't --
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Oh no.
Too bad.
Yeah, I did.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
What --
If I said that, would you stay?
Why do you love me?
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
I'm sorry, I --
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
At last I find you.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
What are you doing with me, Rod?
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Is that your porty or mine?
You're telling me to dance.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
The kid is amazing.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
That's an answer.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Thanks for coming.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
To the pools?
How can I make your life better?
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
You wanted smaller.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
You look good.
What?
What did you say?
Eric! Are you here?
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Well what?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
What?...WHAT!?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
He could have died.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
You had the phone the whole time?
PAUL!
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Absolutely not.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
How would you classify it?
They never got that big.
We could co-write a paper.
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Anything good?
Good luck with the fund raising.
I'd better get going.
Eric, your parents are both here.
Do you have any kids?
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
Bonitas.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
We're safe!
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You are an academic.
What are you talking about?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Hi, Dad.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
What are you guys gonna do?
Cancel that, Dieter.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
What is that?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
Their what?
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Something's wrong.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Because it exists.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Can you set up?
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Pretty sure.
Carousel.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
And what are those?
Why would they care what we think?
So what are you thinking?
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Are you sure?
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
No. We can't.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?
Why not?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
Tim.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
I can't!  I'm scared!
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Where does he think he's going?
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
Oh my God!
Hey, we were saving that!
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Go away!
Watch how it eats!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
What works?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
Fifty.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Jesus Christ!
Quite a circus.
Three.  Where's my client?
Sorry.
Doesnit sleep?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Uh-huh...
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
You saw him?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Ten minutes...
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
You look like brothers.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
Just what you've published.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
-- You appreciate my writing.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
I usually take lunch by the River.
-- Eduard --
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
Are you free tonight?
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
They're not obliged to tell.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
Was he depressed?
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What's the matter?
Ludwig.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
Then that's the place for us!
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Can you fly?
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
It's the same image - Kong!
Jack!
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
What was it, Jack?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Are you nervous Jack?
Did you fear for your life?
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Uh uh.
-- May I? It's so --
Guess!
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Why isn't he locked up?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
What is it?
You said that.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Can't you get him?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
You said it was!
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
You and I -- a relationship.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
You wanted to, or you are?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Not unusual.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
I know Tom Grunemann.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Where is the child?
Does that distress you?
What do you like best about her?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
When is mommy coming back?
What if she forgets?
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Mom, I mean dad...
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Then eat around it.
I'm sorry...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Sleep tight.
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Is this really your desk?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
What don't you understand, pal?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Objection!
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Objection!
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
And how did you find his work?
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Is that...permanent?
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
How's the new job?
I've seen him.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
'Night, Jim.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
How should I know?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
What?
Three months.  How can you tell?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Oh, no..
What if I fight it?
Yeah.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Things? What kind of things?
What are you going to do?
You're on your own, understand?
You ever think about getting married again?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
California?
Ted.
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Huh.. .Hello?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
No.
I do, now.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Goodbye, Kundun.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
With much bloodshed.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
This many?
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
I need to squeeze this brain.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
How big is Tibet's army?
In the Pacific Ocean.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Britain chooses not to.
Has anyone died?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
I am scared.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Do you think I must?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
Things change, Kundun.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
It is a story, you decide.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
You, kill me?
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
You're a beautiful woman.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
Go!!!
And what would he do come winter?
We'd only just met.
We are here on official business.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Is this a trick?
Was he a good man?
This is a setback.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
No!
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Eh.  Fuck it.
He's gonna live?
Kelly Scott.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
What are you doing?
Okay.  We're up at six.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Calm down.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
You sure?  I don't mind...
It was... something meeting you.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
Thanks for your help.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
What?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
What was that?
Hank?
Are you okay?
They're coming right in.
Kelly.
That's not what you came to say.
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Sorry?
Are you on drugs?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
<u>You</u>?
You and Kevin.
No.
What'd I do?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Lecter said a lot of things.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
You're all right! Where is he?
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
And the questionnaire...?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
Go, Doctor.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
What did you do?
So you ran away...
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
What...?
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
My God, you've grown up.
Are you alright?
Will you go back to England?
Where will we go?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
You still have an aversion to the water?
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Some say that's the way of it.
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
I see...
How far is it, scout?
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Will you men help us stop the French?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Yes, sir.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Yes.
Gold could be arranged.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
My colors?
Qui vive?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Was there such a thing?
Be careful with it.
DeJesus!  A readout!
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
We're getting out of here just in time.
It's got Hazy!
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
No way...
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Go on!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
I need more light on that, Four.
Shit!  He sent them all.
We're on backup air.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Who else...Sixpack.
Bullshit.
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
I'm going to try to remove it.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
What's that?
I don't know what you mean.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
JD.
They were going to pay, then?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Son?
It's not him, Dad.
What can I do for you?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
So do you know these geezers well?
It must be this one.
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
And look what happened to that.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
What do you mean?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Well, what did he say?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
I will.
Go on.
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
What's left over?'
The money, the gear!
What are you carrying, Willy?
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
--you're going to be on your own.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
What's that for?
So?
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
You still going to all the home games?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
You look good--
You were in a fight--
No. You?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Come on in--
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Didn't have a father?
So how come you got into all this?
Are we going to ever see your father?
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Cliff--
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
Mikey--
Mikey look at this--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
Yeah. I bet he would.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
Eladio Cruz.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
That's a matter of interpretation--
That so?
I haven't been out here for a while.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
There was a mandate in the last election--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Why would I want to go there?
Right. When he was killed.
Nobody's too busy.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
I'm not open. We were just talking.
What?
Mom?
She finally got in--
You got in late last night.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
Something wrong?
He's all yours.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
No--
I should get back.
I mean what did we know about anything?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
So what are we gonna do about this?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
Yeah.
How 'bout you?
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
I know you?
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
You going to tell her?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Will you come to him on your knees?
And are you afraid?
What's the connection?
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
He's good.
I can be very persuasive.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Are you sure?
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Oh God!
No!  No!  No!
...yes?
Bad show last night?
Sure.
Oh God.
What makes you so sure?
And this Butterfield guy--
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you sure?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
I like to know why things happen.
Leave her alone --
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
I want to see Swann face to face.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Harry D'Amour.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
I only wear ties for funerals.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Oh Jeez.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
... no...
One question.
Have we met before?
Maybe... I... don't...
Yeah, they told me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
What about you? Why are you here?
How long have you been married?
I'm thinking about it.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Oh.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
I know.
You are.
Four.
Do you know where we are?
So, where'd you go today.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Why can't it last?
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
What?
Yeah.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Hello?
Ok.
Hospital?
You wanna come?
Like popcorn?
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
It's amazing  there!
Uh..thanks.
I missed you.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
I spaced out.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
I can take care of myself.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
What is it?
He spoke to you?
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Oh my God!
Yes... and you are?
And also that...
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
I do.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
What?!?!
Trick him.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
Yes, I know.
So what?
Do you know your parents' blood types?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
What are you looking for exactly?
You okay?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Oh, Peter.
A lot of good that'll do.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You know what?  You can go.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Good of you to stop by.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
She told me she killed them.
nothing.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Whatever.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
So you're still breast-feeding?
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
What?
Hello.
Damn, girl.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
They ever love you back?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
Thanks.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I want to ride my own bike.
I don't have to do what you say.
Way to hoop.
And?
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
That's it, give it your best shot.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
You having fun?
Guess not.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
When'd you get this?
Then prove her wrong.
Sorry about your game.
he's just playing, Q...
Who was that?
Who's nobody?
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Stay!
What?
You're what?
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Funny.  I never did.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
You visiting?
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
Cause I don't get it.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
You asked me what was missing.
I heard enough.
You're out of your mind.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
What will this prove?
And what happens when you lose?
No.
We should head over.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Just...leave it alone.
Quincy, please...
Guess I should have been telling your father.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
I just told you.
What's Mom think?
I ain't a damn liar.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
From your mouth.
Look, I'm busy.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Your teeth are straight.
You ok?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
Uh-huh.
My mother had breast cancer.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
I don't wanna talk to you.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
For what?
You mind if I check things back here?
This is my job.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
Great, bye.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
It's fine.
Well.
Yeah.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
It's ok.
No, what's wrong?
You live alone?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
It's ok --
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
What?  What does that mean?
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
I paid you back.
You don't need braces.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
Get a girlfriend.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
Jack.
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I would just want to clear some things up:
And what did your parents do?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
And "Frank?"
He's in here.
How long have you taken care of him?
Is he in pain?
When did he go off chemo?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
You're just come in --
I live alone.
I didn't do anything.
I don't know a loud crash.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
...you know...
No.
What happend to you?
Willa Cather.
What were you saying, Stanley?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
Did you tell her?
I don't think I want that.
You're my handsome man.
Who?
hey.
That's it.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
I'm Bob.
Can I come in?
I'm sorry.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Are you on drugs right now?
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Phone number.
mmm.hmm.
Ok.
Yeah.
Yeah.
yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Be ready at two --
C'mon, man.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Hi.
...what...?
What is that?
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
No, M'lady.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
My Queen...
I am preparing for a ball!
What is it, mother?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
What do you propose to do?
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
How is he?
Three days.
What you're asking is impossible!
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Forgiveness.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Where are we?
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
D'Artagnan, unready?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
But -- are you sure?
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
It's been too long.
I heard your playing.
Raoul is everything to me.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Recent hours have been a shock.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
One for all.  All for one.
Are you hungry?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
You dead yet?
What number, on the first page?
You've... memorized...?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Magnificent valor...
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Every step of the way.
You mind if I ride with you?
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
What the hell happened?
Find out for me.
I'll take the south end -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
I was just having a little fun -
Captain?
Mind if I turn out the light?
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
How much do you know?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
For Christ's sake, why?
Who did he ask for?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Who is it?
Tell me now.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
There has to be.
Something Lecktor said.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
It's getting late and...
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Ride with me.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
You worked out well.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
No. Reba...?
Who?
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
What am I doing here?
Do you see?
'No' what?
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
You will tell the truth?
Yes?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
He's misunderstood.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Hello, hotshot!
At the store. You doin' some good?
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
Mama was probably asleep.
What's this Mama shit?
What's the problem, Molly?
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Thanks for the lift.
Meet point's up ahead!
Lt. Fisk said...
Will it keep them out?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
How?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Did you get my card?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
No.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
I can't move my arm.
My hair is coming out.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Five.
What do you mean?
Hi...
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Go away.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Hey Andy, good show.
I'm gonna quit.
Each show is worse than the next.
It's so dirty.
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Can I help you with something?
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
I saw Michael!
What's in Memphis?
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
What?!
Who is it?
You're two hours late.
You got the money?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Hello, Trinity.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
I got a fibrillation!
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Hello?
Holy fucking shit!
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
... am I dead?
What are you doing?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
How does she know?
Did you believe in them too?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Tank.
We need an exit.
How...?!
Yeah.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
How did you do that?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
What does that mean?
Did you go to her?
What did you just say?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
That I would have to make a choice...
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
No, you're not.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Why?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
What just happened?
They've burned through the outer shields.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Know where he is?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No.
I gotta get the stuff.
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Look at her.
Get out of here before this really goes up.
Where to?
So?
Nervous?
You flew before?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Don't come any closer!!!
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Keep your mouth shut.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Hey, shut up.
How much?
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Well, maybe you missed something?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
No.
I'm sleepy.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You mean it's heisted.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
Can you spare it?
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
Look who's talking.
That was 'Joe'.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Have you got a minute?
I know you do, darling.
Who's Annie?
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Red or white?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
I would prefer some peanut butter.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
Drew, you're out of line.
Well... goodnight.
It doesn't matter.
May I interrupting?
Who are we talking about?
Perhaps you could remind me.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
'Yes'.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Yeah, something he goes by --
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Why?
What are their feelings?
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
He said that?
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Don' be facety, woman.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
Thanks.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
Come again?
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
'To bed'?
You first.
Thank you.
Well -- I --
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
Will it?
The 'coffee shop' --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
What a good idea.
No --
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
Bill --
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Truly - uh - splendid.
You were just curious?
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Okay.  Goodnight.
What's okay?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
And I don't give a shit.
Uh --
Thanks.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
I'm sorry, Bill --
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Then what is it?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
No.
Joe, don't do this --
An offense --
You want me to be your guide --?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Where are you?
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
About what?
I'm sorry --
Yes what?
How're you doing--?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
We're all here, Bill --
Good morning, Dad.
...There's a start for a meeting.
Don't get carried away.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Then what is it?
I don't know, I can't say --
What a night.
Daddy --
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I've got patients coming in --
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
You said you liked me.

MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Condition?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Why?
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Yeah.
Why?
It's isolated.
What?
Kill him.
Who?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not.
They're not looking for him.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
On the house.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
You've read it a hundred times.
Shut your mouth!
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
You really want to find this guy?
You don't know him?
I don't think so.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
So was he scared?
So what are you gonna do now?
What sort of questions?
Like what?
Envelopes?							    *
My wife wasn't diabetic.
You probably.							 *
Sal Maguda.
They'll kill Gina.
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Yeah?
What do you think?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
I don't know.
So...?
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
I got the item.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
When?
We want it back.
What's "nothing"?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
What do you like to drink?
Where's she now?
I insist.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Good samba dancing...?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Would you find me...?
You afraid of violence?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
Yeah?
You got something to say, Jos, let's hear it.
And there's Dmitri...
So?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Anything?
Where?
Havana, Cuba...?
I am asking.  You to me.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
What are you talking about?
Out of...?
Alonzo...!
How'd they get onto you?
Oh, good...
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
Okay...see you soon.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
That sonofabitch!
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
So lay it out, my brother...
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You sure you heard what I said?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
For money.
What's in your socks?
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
I'm scared.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
What you got me up here for?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
You really want to do business?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
The kids? Why are they...
It's there!
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Where you staying, Dad?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
DAD!
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Got a family back there?
And you?
Why the suit?
I think I've been poisoned.
You're ayip!
Know what?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
And a right.
The Department of Public Health...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Any luck?
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Is there a switch?
Can we get this car there?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
The kid...
What are you putting that crap on me for?
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Which way?
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Oh, no, you were-
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
It's no use! They know we're in here!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
What do you want to know?
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
Sure.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Here.
You're very kind...
I can take it, go ahead.
The profanity bothers you?
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Misery's Return?
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
I hope you like it.
You've been out of your room.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Could be the weight of the snow.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
They're hauling Misery into court.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Yes.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Answer me a couple things?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
You won.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
See anything you like?
To win?
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Feel like pleading for your life?
Nyah!
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
What was the top bid?
What you got there, mate?
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
We're due to take off.
There she is.  I got visual.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Uh-huh.
- right..where is it?
Where's the bloody -
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
So where did I got right?
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
What's the population of Seville any idea?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
I managed.
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No.  Should I?
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
And then what?
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Very.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
So what did he say?
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
Come on!
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Did we get it?
I'm walking.
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Max made a deal with you?
I didn't say that.
Kittridge...
Okay...
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire...Hey...
Claire.
Go ahead.
Youre in Prague?
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
What are we downloading?
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
It's quite out of the question.
Very good.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
IMF mainframe.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Higher.  Higher.
I thought I was going to see Max.
Tell you what?
What problem?
Why not?
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Jim...?
You got it.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Whats the problem.
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
The Shawfish?
Are you ready?
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Have I been a good wife?
I have my eyes open.
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Here.
It's temporary.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Why didn't he call himself?
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Loretta. What's that smell?
Fast.
Why?
I don't know.
No.
Stupid yourself.
Why you talking to me?
I'm a wolf?
A bride without a head!
Son of a bitch!
What about Johnny?
I'm marrying your brother!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
What?
Who painted that?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
No thanks.
I'm here!
Ronny!
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
What's the matter?
Yes, on the floor.
I like this ring.
What time is it?
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
He's my younger brother.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
So we'll sell the house.
And we'll sell the house.
Did he tell her?
Are you drunk?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Hi, Loretta.
So.
My mother's recovered.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Who was that?
May I presume to ask you a question?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Yes.
Temperature's dropping.
That's my house.
Yes.
It's a house.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
She's got it.
Burn her anyway.
I see.  Yes, of course.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Am I right?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
All right!  What do you want?
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Stop that.
Are you sure he's got one?
Who ... Who breaks out?
Ni, ni, ni!
What with?
What?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
What?
... You silly sod.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Sorry ...
Good idea, O Lord!
What is your quest?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
If we ... er ... 
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
Right.
Well ...
Well, she's got a point.
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Sir Gawain.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
Stop saying the word!
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
I speak as I find, Archie.
How much?
Not bad, not bad.
What are you doing?!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
What's this?
The place is a mess.
It's what the maids are for.
Hey, Barney.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
What did you say?
Do you know who you address, sir?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Checked and locked, sir.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
No.
Go inside at once.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
Do you hunt?
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
Was there never ambition?
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
Those, over there, there.
What is it, John?  John?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Then they may read about me.
Should we take it seriously?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Mrs Brown.
Erysipelas.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Where did you find it by the way?
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Why?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Who told them that?
Why not?
Ma'am?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Maybe he's not dead.
Has anyone seen Greg?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Hello?
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
The Police, then...
Virgin sacrifices?
You got the schematics?
What are you looking for?
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
The clock's already ticking.
Shit...
So that's what we almost died for?
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
It's the wrong way!
What did he do to you?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
Mom?  You're alive...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
So what do you think?
So start at the beginning...
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
But I'm not broke.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
So what's the problem?
How...  how'd they know I was here?
So, what did they say?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
I...
Your Aunt called me.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
A car ... a car accident.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
No, no, I'm fine.
Can you tell me what happened?
Number 17.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
I think I've been hurt.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
I don't know.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
No.... I don't...
Okay.
No. Just the coffee.
"You're still here?"
"So... surprise"...
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
No... but...
Wally Brown.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Nice wallets.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Hardly.
Not here...no thanks.
No...
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
You must come in first place to move on !
Why should we trust you ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
How long till the room fills ?
This is cute.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
Trust is earned not given away.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
How long till the drug wears off ?
We can't afford too many surprises.
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Are you okay ?
I think we should follow him...
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
You had to remind me?
How did you know my name?
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
THANK YOU.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Seriously.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
My mother can't have any more kids.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Then what did she do?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Hi there...can I help you?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
He said it was a gift.
Vada.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
Get married?
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Boyfriend?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Just come and get it...right here!
Woah, watch it!
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
It's not his fault!
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Write me a poem?
No?
What's it for?
Wow!
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Lock the door.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Maybe.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
You're Nick's mother?
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Excuse me?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Really?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
It's there.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
You don't like it?
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Hi.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Dance with me?
What are you wearing?
Do you want to?
I ahh, better go.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Of course not.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
She likes to play bingo.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Why?
No, no no....
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Cause she's dying.
No.
Do you like her?
My Dad was funny?
She's shy.
He won't give it to me.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Are you going out somewhere?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
I like my name.
Where's Daddy?
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's okay sweetheart.
I knew he wouldn't come.
No, I'm going home.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Hurry!
Naah, I don't wanna.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Sorry.
Bed wetter!
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Woah!!
Run faster they're after us!!
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I do, she's real funny.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Say something it's too quiet.
For what?
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
You think...
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
I give.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Excuse me?
But I can't be dry.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
What else did he tell you...
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
How about...
But he sure can kiss.
And loving him means loving all of this.
So... one almost has to...
Exactly what?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Well, you're a little early...
And she's all wrong for me!
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
You're not eating.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
Dance card filled?
Takes me back.
No accents today.
Will she like it?
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
Michael? What ha...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Lower.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Almost three.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
Maybe it's happy there.
No.
I said, I've been real tired.
What do you really want?
Yes.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
What?
You want anything?  A drink?
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
What's he running for?
National television?
Where'd he ever see us?
Bastard
You're kidding.
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Yes, sir. I need a room
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Did you see who that was?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
What's this?
Who's that?
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
Mom?
Fungus?
Have your children been deaf since birth?
When did you start singing?
How long have you been with them?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Yes.
Oh.
Doesn't it have a name?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
When did you think it would happen?
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
You know who that is?
They said go see the chaplain.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Hello. John Triplette.
Oh, no.
Sorry I'm late.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Probably a little too long.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
You go to school together?
Oh --
Peter Finch -- he's English.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Yeah.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Yours.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
I could go for a Coke.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Take a wild stab!
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
You can't be serious?
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Ya know, I was.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Three.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
It sure is.
Boy - you hear me?!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Want to talk to you.
You a union man?
Yeah.
What d'you want?
They say your dad's 'round town.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Yes, aren't you?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Hell!
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
What d'you mean?
I wouldn't have let you.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Surprised?
How old is your boy?
What's he like?
Hi.
How did it go?
Thank you.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
What about him?
What about them?
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Don't, Duff.
Hi.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
No point fixin' it!
You heard me!
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Duff, I love you.
Where're you going to go?
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Okay.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
What's so hot 'round town?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
See you, Duff.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Take it easy, Pop.
How you doin', boy?
Seems a little loose!
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
Come on, Pop.
How 'you gonna live?
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Come on, Will.
Got a thick feelin' here.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Let me get you another glass of wine.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
You've got your orders.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Tell me the words.
Hey, bro.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Where the hell have you been?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Yo.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
Wait... You hear that?
I know who you are.
And we really do have to talk.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Maybe something's onto him.
Holy shit...
How soon is soon enough?
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Case... Are you alright?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Like what?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
What's that?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
What?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Who told!
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
What if I say no?
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Hey--what are you thinking about?
Hey Rob, what's going on?
It's just for a couple of months.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
You're twenty-three years old!
Wow, Josie- you look really-
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
This seat taken?
Are you--scared?
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I'm alone.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Into our group.
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
Wow - I-
By name.
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Coming...
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Help me with this thing!
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
So, you live around here.
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
You're fucked in the head.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
You okay?
You mean a shithead.
I think it's sad...
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
What is this place?
So, you feeling anything?
What is it?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
What's so funny?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
We're going up to bed now.
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Did she always have nightmares?
I'm serious.
I'm sure you would.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What?
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
So what do we do about this creep?
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
You like gymnastics?
Freddy?
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
I don't know...
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
Oh God.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
That's right.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Stop blaming yourself.
The truth.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
We've got work to do.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
We're here.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
And then I... right.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Too complicated.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Whoopsidaisies.
So who left who?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Yup.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Can I stay a bit longer?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
Excuse me?
This is certainly... ah...
Hi.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Yes...
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Excuse me.
Does the girl have a name?
Yup.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Is this your first film?
Yes.  What do you think?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
Ahm... room service.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
I agree.
I did.
That's right -- Topol.
So I get the brownie?
Buggered?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Hello.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Cool, huh?
Hey.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Yes.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I wouldn't go outside.
Which floor?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Yes, Mister Harding?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Tell us about it...
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Get up, Billy.
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
I'm not finished yet.
Yeah?
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
You men remain seated!
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
So long, kid.
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
Marry who?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
In ya go...
Say it again.
Say... God Bless America!
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
I'll bet a dollar.
Ya know what, Fred?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
So why are you talking to him?
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What's your plan, Mack?
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Let me see your hand!
Why not?
When?
Yeah, buddy?
'Kay, place your bets.
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Right!
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
I wanna go home!
Jesus God...
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
When?
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Yeah, buddy?
You think it's funny, huh?
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Got a cigarette?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
What are they?
You know, I never got your name.
Yeah...
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Bet!
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
Whew! Hiya, boys!
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
What?...
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
There is one other thing you should know about me.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Where are you going?
How could you do this to me?
Are you okay?  You want some help?
To the foot doctor.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
And she's a knock-out, too.
I'm sorry.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Yes.  I am.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
What would you call it?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
So what do you think?
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
What's he do?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Have you seen him with someone?
It's still the new year...
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
So?
I'm hungry.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
That was really sweet...
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
It was a ouija board, remember?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Amazing...
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
And he is living proof.
Maybe I can change him.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
It's siesta.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
I have to talk to her.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Right now?
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I wish I knew.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Mmhmmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Father Barry.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles. 
They play pretty rough.
I'm with Terry.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
The moment I saw you.
What for?
How do you like that one?
Want to go out and have one with me?
No thanks... .
Were you really a prize fighter?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
I I'd like to, Edie, but  there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says
I I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Terry what's happening to you?
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Am I on my feet...?
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
But you've got to listen to me.
About Edie?
Now don't give me a hard time.
What did you say?
...walk?
You can!
Who asked him here?
You still call it ratting?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
So help me God!
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?
Never will be much too soon.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
Boy, you must've been up early.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Better.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You was a Golden Warrior.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Give me a double.
Terry?  What do you want?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I
I know, Johnny, I know... .
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Leave her alone, you fiend!
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
What can we do?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
What kind of symbol?
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
When!?
I understand, Master
Oh, if there is only time!
The time...is short.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
He wants us.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
He called the day he escaped.
You're good.
You were his what, his box?
Where in the hell are we?
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Do we need him?
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
How long were you with the girl?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You ever wear one of these?
They found the safe.
Come <i>on</i>.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
You talked to him?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
You excited?
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Quite a mess.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
So you've done this before, huh?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Good luck, Richard.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
You don't seem all that scared.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
We still talk, though.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
I mean, romantically.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Is that how you think of yourself?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You're not dumb.
You think he's lying?
Wait in the car.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
The fish?
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
You busted out?
There were others.
The <u>ninth</u>?
And so now you're off to Glades.
You don't remember me, do you?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
That was some shit, huh?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Flyweight.
Moselle Miller?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
No.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Got run over by a car.
It's beautiful.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
You here all by yourself?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
Midge.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
How could you do this?
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Then why are you looking for her?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
How come you're not pukin'?
Where are we going?
What's there?
They're all over us!
You hear my okay?
Fun today.  Like old times.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Sorry.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Sorry to trouble you.
Win?
You take care, Dorie.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
They're waiting. Come on.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
You really love me, don't you?
What do you know about classical music?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What are you doing here?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Just take a look at it. 
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Come back to me.
Did you study for the test?
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Are you for real?
Terry! Slow down.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh, you're both so naive.
Does everybody have to hear?
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Who was that man?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
I'm not the maid!
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember that dress.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
You're giving me the creeps.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Like what?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Silicon is from sand.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Out?
What's wrong?!
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
I think so.
Hey! Where're you off to?
What's his name?
Is this a good spot?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
How did it go with your father last night?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
It could be parasites, an infection...
Don't apologize for me.
Why are you getting dressed?
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Take it easy, Walter.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
Innocuous?
New baby?
Kids are great.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Thanks for your time.
One more thing, Your Honor...
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
Opera?
A regular all-American guy?
What do you love about it?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
What can I do?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Hello?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
Objection!
Objection!
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Leave that.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
A homosexual encounter.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
Julius!
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Oh, Lord....
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
But I just wanted to say --
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
What, you're afraid?
They're already dead. Get on board.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
Dancin' on razor blades here...
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
So you noticed too?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Owens!
I don't suppose....
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
We crossed our own tracks.
...then we saw this.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
I apologize.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
This place is dirty, doctor.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
No cigar.
She comes along too.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Gorilla hunters ...
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
How so?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
What is your proposal?
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Taylor! Tell him.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
It's humiliating.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Bunker...
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Sarge?
Taylor! Francis!
First time?
But what'd she actually do?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
And you, do you believe?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
Okay - got light duty, three days.
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Right on.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
You don't want to hear about it?
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
No thanks?
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Want a spike in it?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
We try to be decent.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Private eye?
Got it on you?
What's this in favor of?
What?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
Thank you.
Where?
Could be.
How are you two getting along?
Time for a little chat?
Mitchell was too drunk.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
Send that?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
What do I get for it?
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Was that about the right angle?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I am a fool.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
And if you didn't believe me?
No doubt about that one.
Ye have, have ye?
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
How long have you had it?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Of course.
I told you she's just..
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Can I give you a lift?
Oh yes?
Again?
Me too.
In radio we're different.
Not here.
Bastard.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
That's enough of that.
The torture of small children--
Okay, I will.
Oh, I see.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
You're so famous now.
What have you got there?
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
We're wasting time.
Why should I?
Three seconds... two... one...
You never were...
Yeah?  What?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Sorry.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
... so I started tailing him.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
I know where they're going.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
This gonna take long?
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Nice place.
Look at you.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Those are cold.
I... I gotta go.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Bye.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
What's got Billy so spooked?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
That's over the border, General.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Georgia.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Who are you going after next, sir?
Mr. Harris.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
I... I would take advantage of it.
You looking' for some company?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
New York.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
No, but it's getting there.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
What do you like?
Did you sleep well?
Where'd you go?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
All right.  How much for the week?
It'd cost you.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
The Rex.
I'm sorry.
And that's the way the game is played.
Why not?
Okay.
What about dinner?
You still mad at'm?
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Do I look okay?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I know.  I'm glad.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Aw, don't... no...
I didn't think so.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Love this car!  Is it new?
Edward, did you hear me?
What time's diner tonight?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Why do you want to know?
You're being ridiculous.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Edward, we've been together ten years.
All this because of that whore!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Looks slow tonight.
He... he just does.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
You bullshittin' me?
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Oooh, I love those.
They will serve salad.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
May I help you?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Get out!
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
My Westley will always come for me.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
I killed him myself.
Who are you?
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
But how can you be sure?
Singed a bit, were you?
We did it.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
I don't think more than ten.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
-- Fezzik, please --
Will this do?
Inigo.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
A book?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Westley's only faking, right?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Could this be a trap?
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Where's Fezzik?
-- yes --
-- anything you want --
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Sixty-five.
Slow going?
Sorry.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
Because I know something you don't know.
I must know.
Making sure nobody's following us.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
You're just stalling now.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Good, what is it?
What is that?  A handkerchief?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Help!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
What do you mean?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
What kind now, Leo?
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
What are you doing?
I never should have listened to you.
Don't help me.
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Not.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
You, Blum go Motel.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
No.
Cash.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
I live there. Alone.
Of course not.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Yes?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
What thing?
What thing could we be in together?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
You want me to stay here?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
It's been three.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
I feel better when you feel better.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
Probably on his way back right now.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
He didn't come back here?
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Where'd you go to college?
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
You're very... kind.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Why don't you go away?
That's it. 
In quite a hurry.
Is anything wrong?
May I see your license?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
No mother.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
But where do the rats come in?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
What were you dreaming about?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
There's no hurry. It's early.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
I think so.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Do you know George Winton?
That's the one.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
I see. Was that all she said?
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Is that a fact?
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Shall we unpack it?
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
What was her name?
Mia...?
Could be.
I've been dreaming about this.
I know, Mother.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
What'd you say, Brother?
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
Yeah.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Are they polar bears, too?
How could that be, son?
That's what she would say herself.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Of course.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Strange voices, Rose?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, it was a silly question.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Yes, I am.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
What's the matter with him?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Never again, never again...
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Indivisible and inseparable.
And... ?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Who cares?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
"A.D."
No offices are gonna be open today.
Wh... what... ?!
Dean Martin.
Gimmie a butt.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Hey...
What the... ?!  What was that for?
I can't believe we're stealing.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
Our resignations.
Maybe.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Pure horse.
Yeah... great.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You know what I mean.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You get him?
Been waiting long?
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
You see that?
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I have felt him, my Master.
They are clear, my Master.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Hey, are you awake?
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Good luck.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
What's he saying?
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
He's my father.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Come with me.
Yoda, I must know.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
You!
Janet!
So please don't tell me to can it.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Oh....Say something.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Brad...
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
You did right.
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What guy
"Transylvania"
Feeling
Dealing
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
I just dislocated my finger.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
Why?
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
I always knew you was pretty.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Like?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
...And he called the reporters --
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...I can't beat him.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
No... I can't!
...Like you?
Oh, Rocky!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
...That's an old one.
This a con?
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
What?
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
...What?
...Did ya fight last night?
Did ya get the message, kid?
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Fifty years, huh.
How 'bout a glass of water?
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Ya nose is broke.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Hey --
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
I got whiskey here.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
To see ya train.
Outta my house I want ya!!
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Is this paper even good?
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
What was <u>that</u>?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Where is he?
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
When will I hear from you?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maybe.  Why?
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
Aah!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Does this help?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
No better?
Have patience!
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
A challenge, on my life.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
How well my comfort is revived by this.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Juliet!
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
I take thee at thy word.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
And so did I.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Pink for flower.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
It's under your seat.
Of course.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
So what's the deal?
What is?
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Lose them!
About time!
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
I still am.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
I better be getting that.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Who are you?  IRA?
It's quite satifactory.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
Do you have the material?
What do you mean?
And more importantly --
Sent it where?
Is it done?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
American.
Yeah.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Created?
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
They call me Swede.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Perhaps the police?
Cigarette?
What'd you say to him?
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
What's going on?
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
You know him?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
They don't have the package.
Give me a cigarette.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
I'm not here very much.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Would you stop with that...
You speak French.
I know.
What happened to it?
You slept with her!
Doing well.  This is?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Damn.
Ready to roll, partner?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
We don't know that.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
I've got one condition.
Shhh!
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Maybe we should say somethin'.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Yeah I'm fine.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Why does that bother you?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
And what's that?
I don't know.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Don't you have to be here?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Anything I can help you with?
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Damn its hot in here...
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Whatever...
You'd do this to me?!
I'm not asking.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
I didn't know you were coming.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Are you hungry?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
Winner!  Four, winner!
The band has been playing over an hour.
Wait.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Oh, you American?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Hello.
What's wrong?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Who?
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
No.  It's not right.
I don't want to hear this.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Fine with me.
Yes.  We have heaven.
What's a Chinese heaven?
How was the sex?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Steamed dumplings?
Are you serious?
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Ricky Tan is alive.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Do you still have the bills?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Who the hell is that?
He stole my wheel!
Beach Boy.
Help me Rhonda.
Where were we?
Shortcut?
The license!  You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
You like it?
Want some?
Which one?
Like that.
No, please, I don't --
Oh no.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
Not anymore.
You're killin' me here.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Yo, Johnson...
Hmmmm?
What?!
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
Where do we find him?
I would like one of my people to help.
You don't understand this guy.
Right.
See you at the wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
Of course.
And in a "V".
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
"Nothing but net."
Rub your ears.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Maggie!
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
What?
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
That's fair.
Really?
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
I'll have the same.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
It's fun!  It's high.
Lost!
About a minute...?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
To who?  Are you asking me?
I'm listening.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
What happened at the luau?
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
You okay?  I'm closing.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
You take the microwave?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
It's delicious, trust me.
You go.
About forever.
Walter.
I told you.  Nothing --
You okay?
Oh!
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Did you talk to him?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
What about the letter?
I love the symphony.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Where's your mom?
Is he home right now?
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
It is not --
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Dad, could you close the door?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad --
Not.
Sure.  Looking good.
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
It was sinking.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Dad!
Thank Victoria for dinner.
What are you doing up?
Did you call that radio station again?
Everyone at work heard you.
God, she's beautiful.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
You said we could go to New York.
No.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
It's a little derivative.
I thought you were never going to call me.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Is he there?
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
A fighter, huh?
What were they saying? About you? In there?
Let them take it!
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
How do you feel?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Where are you going?
Ramn -- you can't.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
This is what we've been waiting for.
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Go on. Spill it.
No. New York.
Well, if that's possible ...
Lus! Come down here!
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
What is it?
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Oh God.
It's not that easy.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Why don't you call the cops?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
How much time do you have?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
Who is it?
We been through that.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
What is it?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
How you holding up?
Who is it?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How the hell did we get this detail?
My features. They're Finnish.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Fuuuuuck
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Was he the president?
What's this?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
You're serious?
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
I was getting to it.
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
What? Is it bad?
I thought you'd be happy.
Danny?
The Mexicali Boys
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
We know what's going on.
He's the only one I told.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Really?
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You think that's a good idea?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Report.
Resistance?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
Good luck, John.
Jackson?
No kiddin'?
Where?
Watching.
How about that jeep?
Some.
Good luck, Captain.
The men said, nine.
I wonder where they're going.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
What'd you say, Captain?
GO!
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Beasley's dead.
You get a translator, Captain?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
How about...?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
I don't think so, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
No, sir.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Goddamn it!
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Who cares?
Frogs?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
You think he really believed it?
Pardon me?
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Hi.
I'll take the whole set.
Thanks, I like yours too.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Gee, it's easy.
I'll be in my office.
That's unlikely.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Did you sleep with her?
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I don't feel anything.
Lloyd is doomed.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Visit her at the home.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Tell me, is it bad news?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Morning.
Do you love him?
You think you know what this money is?
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
That's right, work it out.
Mom, please?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Busy?
Are you busy on Friday?
Are you busy on Saturday?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Keymaster?
Have a good sleep.
Sure I do.
You know what?
I think you should wear that.
After work?
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Yes.
Okay, this is important...
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
No.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
It did?
You shared it with a dick.
Did you tell anybody?
What do you want?
What do you want?
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Okay.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
What?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
No, really.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Later for you, Luke.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Well, let's find him.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
You know what, you'd like her.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
Where are the guards?
What's that?
God bless you, sir.
What others?
I was just the accountant.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
Have you checked the...
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
Outside.
Yes.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Hello? Ted?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Where is Sidney's father?
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
This is exactly what I don't want.
Go on, untie him.
Two.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
So we found a compromise.
We had to have financing.
I never meant to imply...
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Yeah?
Not good. How you doin?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Where are you?
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Sid, I'll come with you.
What?
Yes, goddammit!
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
Can I come with her?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
..it's really about family and tradition...
I hate scary movies.
Take it off.
What are you talking about?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What?!
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Please, call me Gale.
Jesus Gale what happened?
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
What do you mean?
Hmm.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
What about me?
You used to say that was our strength.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Jennifer needs me.
Stop following me.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Sidney, what happened?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Your life?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Basements creep me out.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
No.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
I didn't kill anybody.
How'd you do?
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
It's on the table.
You rode your bike out there?
What are you doing here?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
Jesus, SHIT!
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
I don't understand...
What number are you trying to reach?
I think you have the wrong number.
Who is this?
Uh-huh.
Yes?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
...please...
No...
Michael... Michael Myers.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
I'll call for backup.
Does mom know?
I don't know. I guess.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
About thirty seconds.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
I'm not here to fight.
You owe my mother.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Can you see me right now?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
Are you okay?
I heard screaming.
Have a good trip.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Stop. Right there.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
Jesus, this place is packed.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
You're crazy -- both of you.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
No way.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
Already.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
What?  What?
What do you mean?
You didn't know.
Where we headed?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
You should be thanking me.
Somerset...
I... I don't follow.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Who said this was murder?
It's a bucket of vomit.
This doesn't make any sense.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
How's that?
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
Did you read them?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
This is the one thing.
I wish I still thought like you.
Why would we?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Sorry about that... I just...
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
You stupid son of a...
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
Oh, you want to stay now?
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
You know he's fucking us.
Are you absolutely certain?
I don't know, with this case.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
You askin' me to clear out now?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Let's get along...
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
Another one, eh?
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Unnt-meah!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
I beg your pardon?
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Say it. We're beat!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
I think maybe we oughta...
You figger Scar means to kill us?
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Was your niece about their age?
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
She's not a little girl any more.
Might at least have left me my pants!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
But couldn't you...?
I have to cut his windpipe...
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
I miss Tommi so much.
Martin, it's not funny!
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
So, did you sleep good?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Ah
You are a gentleman.
Follow that boat!
What do you want, Kit?
You have the last act?
Tomorrow.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
We have no Juliet!
We will all be put in the clink.
The title?
No, your marriage bed.
So now you are free to love
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
There's never any
It is over.
Do you know it?
I feel a scene coming on.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Will! Have you finished?
By God, I wish I knew.
Another little problem.
The show must  you know
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"Good morrow, cousin."
"But new struck nine."
Two hours at prayer!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
Will!
Master Shakespeare
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
Like you, I found him not at home!
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
I am.
You would not leave me?
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
Then I will go with you.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
Your name?
Take off your hat.
Yes, sir.
And break her heart and mine?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
You're a bad loser.
What do you think?
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
No.
You mean immoral.
He's still here.
So who's going to do it?
I can't do it.
I don't know.
How much?
What's all this for, more security?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
I want to secure it.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I don't know them.
Sorry to waste your time.
And you like it?
What?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
-- instead of what he is --
I think you're lying.
Now?
Stop nagging.
Sshh.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
You know we're right.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Expecting anyone?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
I refuse.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
What?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, I've never seen them.
Yes.
Two hundred pounds.
Expecting anyone?
Who have you talked to?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
You get the job done.
I see.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
No. I haven't seen them.
Yes.
Sorry?
Do you think George is a fairy?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Thanks a lot.
I'll be back in a while.
You're late, George.
I don't want to talk about it...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
But aren't you...
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
That headboard.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Yeah, it is.
Pardon me?
You're late, George.
You do it.
So how's Norman?
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Why not?
It was after you, baby. After you.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- you are.
-- gee...
He still having parties?
What are you looking at?
-- very nice, very nice.
-- ass and legs --
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Where are you going?
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
I don't know... Jackie?
God, there's Lester...
Oh yeah?
What with?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- yes, George.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
Maybe you don't even like children.
George.
Whether or not I'm going.
No, but I think they might.
When?
Jill says nothing.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Bullshit.
Yes.
-- please, baby --
What? What? What? What? What?
-- yes.
Yes, yes, I did.
What're you here for?
No.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
It's good you want to do something, George.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Tonight?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Well anyway...
You live like a pig.
Godammit, George...
I wanna hear about it.
Want a drink?
Have a drink.

I'm coming over.
A daytime soap opera.
Well maybe I can get you something.
Yes.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
You and your touchy investors.
I'd like a drink.
No.
I am? I mean why?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Well, what is it, honey?
What?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Johnny!
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Good for you.
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?
What's wrong?
-- I'll get in the back --
Thank you.
You seem disappointed.
Everything okay, son?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
I won't make any noise.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Is Tony one of your animals?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
A nigger!
She eh... interferes.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Any ideas yet?
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
What do you want me to do about it?
Did you find anything?
I...
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me,
Give me the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I don't believe they did.
Thanks.
Hi.
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
It could have been anything, Marty.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
Yeah? Really?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
But how?
His ashes?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
HE'S SO FINE.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Two days.  An hour or so.
That machine.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Hopeless I
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
We need experience.
I'm getting experience.
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Mary Clarence!
It has come to pass.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
And the vow of chastity.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Yeah?
I got it.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
What are you doing here?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
Ten flights?
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
What'd she say?
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
I am?
I have?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
Well?
What's she doing?
I'd rather sing than do anything!
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
The Widow Windsor.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
What is that you wear?
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
What books?
This is farewell.
How are you?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
It is only me.
My God... what has happened?
What... what are you doing... ?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
The church.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Use caution.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
She has confessed.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
I'll see you, Bill.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Yeah.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Leave.
Leave.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I want to be baptized.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Don't you live somewhere?
Do you like to play football?
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
You want to go with me?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
What you readin'?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
It was fun, anyhow.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Yes sir.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I know he does.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Thank ye.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
That boy wants me to.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
Is he leaving right this minute?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And what are you, his chaperone?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
What happened?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
I didn't know you took pictures.
I've never seen anything like it.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
It's kind of overwhelming.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
So what did he say when he called?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
You usually get two.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
What do you mean?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Still, you can't just write her off.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Lovely.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
Does it hurt?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
No thank you.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
Hi there, little brother.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Here and there. Around.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I didn't expect to see you again.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Three nights.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Hey, it's you.
Appreciation for what?
Where did you get that thing?
And?
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
How do you want that cooked?
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
Why?  If they could never take title.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
You think so?
Cigarette?
We don't let go, you s...
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Improved...how?
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
I beg your pardon.
You're welcome.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
We're not?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Yeah - where were you?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
You mean it's a girls' band?
Where are we running, Joe?
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Blow where?
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
Oh, he does!
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
WHAT?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Hey - these are real diamonds.
That's some nerve!
Sugar?
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
She sings, too.
We'll take a rain check.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
And you've got cold feet.
You all right?
How's the bottle?
Not you, Sugar.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
What do you think you're doing?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
We don't have to run.
Josephine -
Did he get fresh?
How did you get that bracelet?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
I was it.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
I don't like no witnesses.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
Because I got some plans -
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
We got time off for good behavior.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Running away?  From what?
We understand.
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
What makes you so sure?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I wish you'd make sure.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Your face is familiar.
Your view of what?
How's the stock market?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
Well, I guess I'd better go -
The most wonderful thing happened -
One of whom?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Three?
What a beautiful fish.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
I never knew it could be like this.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Daphne -
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Ill just check into a hotel.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hey, Kat.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
That was a long time ago.
So, whats your point?
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Hi. Hey.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
Mmm.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
What does your gut say?
Yes.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Is this for last night?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
I should go.
You didnt have to do that.
Whats he do anyway?
Oh, no. He told you.
So whyd you let him go?
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
Not yet...
What is it you do again?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Here it is, right here.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Mornin', son...
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Did you see Daddy?
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
What did he want?
But, Nathan--
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
I can't believe he's dead.
Hey Cartman.
Your behind?
Mph rmpmh rm.
Mph rm rmph!!
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Oh yeah.
Kyle?!
Look at that!
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Who is it?
Guess.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
That's gonna take a long time!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Oh, brother.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
You'd fuck your uncle!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Fight the power!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Who's my cream puff?
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
NAZIS!!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
I think we're moving.
Anna...
Evening.
Oh, thank you.
Well I appreciate that.
Were you going to give it to them?
What did you say to me?
So, are you on for the next one?
You gotta think of your old age.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Look at this...Jesus.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
We're going to die.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
I can't let you do that.
Are you ready?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Oh my God.  What happened?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
Take this flare.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
So what's going to happen to you?
What the hell are you doing?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
What is happening around here!!!
I'm homesick.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
What the hell is that?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Heh, heh, heh.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Hey, you still here?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
- canker sore.
Buzz Fazeli.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What the fuck is this?
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Hello?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
Leave him alone!
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Get that outta your mouth!
He's not here.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
Business.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Whoa.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
You told Junior that we did it.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Some unfinished business.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
Fletcher, get away from there...
Get out of there!
Fletcher!  Now!
How big is this spacecraft?
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Don't do it, Norman!
Thank you, Colonel.
-- dating the crash at least that old.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
But sir --
You don't want to know.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
Going active.
Can you open that panel?
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
So how do we get it open?
So?  What's the problem?
You don't know that.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
What?
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
They switched us over.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
Because when we get down there --
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Norman!
Where'd this come from?
Wait a minute.
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Don't tell me to calm down!
You, me and Harry?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
You get it straightened out?
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Looks like some sort of code.
Parasolutrine?
What's that?
It's an idea.
What is it, Norman?
Did you?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
He can't manifest.
Yes.
That's bullshit.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
I promise --
Beth --
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Beth, stop it!
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
You hear that?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Then what is it?
When did it come across?
Nice work, Norman.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
... you there?  Norman?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Did I kill her?
Push her, c'mon.
Well, press something!
How's that working out, by the way?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
You mean they haven't told you yet?
You've heard of me?
What report?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Well, he's polite.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
You saw through me?
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
What's wrong?  What's happening?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
I don't believe it !
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Carmen...?
Where are you going ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Good for you.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
None at all... We won.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
You're late.
Shhhh...!
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Cover me.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Well, see ya.
C'mon...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
...CUT OFF !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Oh, my, what's that ?
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Can you walk ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Hit your jets, sir !
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
The examination is a normal function.
Disclose the information.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
You saved the ship.
Granted.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Time to impact...?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Hold station.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
We're losing the pattern...!
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Evening, Annie.
Then you'll be wet.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
You bringing your new friend?
You like my play.
You get what you pay for.
That: in an act of...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
About <u>conflict</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
What happened?
What are you doing down there?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Great.  Who is it...?
Hi.
Thank you.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Yes.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
Hi.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Press still works.
That's something a man could do...?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
What is it all about?
Drama Group?
I've been thinking.
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.
He's on the ph...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Waterford, Vermont.
Fourteen year old girls.
That's right.
They think it's your First Wife...
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
What do you drink?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Tell it with...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
<u>Bobby</u>...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I'm very sorry to...
Aren't you ever in school?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
You have no right to...
Will you help me out...?
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
And you know what...?
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
...yes...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
Did she throw up?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Kiss my ass.
Why?
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
I...
What's in the case?
I'm looking for the writer.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
I had a witness I would.
He saw the girl in the car...
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
We're out of money.
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I know the feeling.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
What's the...
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
What did you say to them...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
What is that...?
My oh my.
It's just a formality.
I don't got the money.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
Yeah?
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
I've got two days to get this house...
I want them thrown in jail.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
...not at all...
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
So why are you asking me?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Look she's upset --
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
This'll work, huh?
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
Great.  Big ears, too?
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
I hate her.  I really hate her.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
Excuse me --
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
So you're okay.
Where Ben?
Find the bird cage?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
That's necessary, huh?
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
We...
It's temporary.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
I have a snoop.
However many.  It's not enough.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
I don't know wh...
Look, you've never liked me...
Did I hear the word...
You bet you are.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
She's devastated.
And you said...?
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
It's the same choice you made.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Ben never mentioned it.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
I needed some time away.
Can we go sit somewhere?
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
You heard me: leave the table!
Hey.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Nice to have you here.
Consuelo?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
You have a bay?
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
The camerawork's nice.
Don't even joke about that!
We did the same thing last year also.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Reconceive.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
But what kind of pull did you have?
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
You're not.
That's good.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
No.
I hate reading.
I dunno...
But...you called.
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Oh, that's too bad.
I do.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
OK. Bye.
Scooby?
What for?
Can I see what you have so far?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
I'll lead.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Let's move it we got company!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What's that supposed to mean?
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
That's it!  Up ahead!
Enjoying the tour so far?
Go fuck yourself...
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Well?
So, what are we looking at White?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Are we adrift--
Get your men to do it!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
So what?
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
Yes, sir.
Why do you think I ask?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I suppose they are, sir.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I guess so.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Right.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Then there's no chance for recall?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Yes?
What's the target.
Roger, maintain.
What else could it be?
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Maximum ECM.
Then this is it.
Check.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
They can't touch us at this height.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
No kidding.
Second safety.
Primary bomb is live.
Where'd they get you?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
We are?
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Can I have some?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Uh, home, you know.
No I quit.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
No, I'm here. Where are you?
It's your birthday?
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Jesus Christ.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
I'd get bored.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
A long, long, long...
Good.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
Hey, man.
Bullshit.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Great.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Score! Yeah!
He paid you man.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
No, but I heard it was great.
Yeah, we're all above that.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Yeah!
Yeah!
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
A Porsche.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
I know. It's okay.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, wow.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
What'd you do?
You lied to me.
Why? Because I give a shit?
I don't know.
No.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
This is my home.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Nazeer what?
Oh! Trim it!
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
So what do you wanna do?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, I don't.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Do your covers and all that shit.
Go.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Really?
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
For a while.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Look, get down off my property.
Look Pakeesa...
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
I hope you're happy!
Pony, oh my god!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
So? What's L.A. like?
Yeah?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah?
You do not want me to do your cover.
Jesus, Jeff.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
No, I'm going.
Is that Jeff?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
I'm going out later.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Hello?
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Screw Lucy!
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Good party.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
This is Miss Kramer.
Hurt feelings department.
You forgot this.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I didn't.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
May I say you smell real special.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Gordon Cole?
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
We've missed you too, dear.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
You're a writer, you said.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
I will not have it butchered.
I want you to do this work.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
It's getting kind of late --
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Keep it.
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
I made your bed this afternoon.
Whose room was this?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
We've come for the car.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
Let me kiss you.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
She said it wouldn't last.
I don't love you any more.
Away. From you.
I'm not mad at you.
Wait. Don't leave me.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
What is it?
They think I have a concussion.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I can't help it if men notice me.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
Superman will return it.
What are you making:
I can do that.
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Who are you ?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
Shouldnt've done that.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Are you happy, Zaltar?
Tuesday.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You...um...you never got married?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
I just can't stand this.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Wipe 'em out?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
What?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Everything.
Yeah? How's it look?
Stone mutha.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Thank ...you.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
There's no rush.
The picture looks blurry.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Oh, Superman!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Okay? Goodbye.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
I don't kiss.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
It is kinda romantic.
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Let's go to my place.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
You do?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Does Lois know about this yet?
Gee. But --
A parka.
I like trees.
You'll miss the battle of the century!
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
What more?
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
You're late. Very late.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Oh . . . my . . .
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
Impossible? Why?
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
Is he for real?
Where's Clark?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
What was that about?
You think he'll find us.
What I need this for?
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
You're a great architect, Albert.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Me?
Keep warm now.
I'd like to.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Can I take you to the airport?
You're just jealous.
Is that what they're calling him?
Besides that.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Krypton!
Mr. Romance...
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
You're not going to hit me?
You got wax in your ears?
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Then -
What're you writing, Lois?
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Lois, the kickback story...
Wha'...what are you doing here?
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh.
Can you really see through anything?
Do you like pink?
I...uh...
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
There.
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Please...
I still don't get it.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Yes.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
We're...not together.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
So there were others?
Then...when did she get better?
What happened?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Alison.
I can help you.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
It just seems...kind of weird.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
Have you been waiting long?
What time's he coming home?
They can look forward to that.
Because I have to.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
That's right.
What do you mean?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
He knows that?  Billy?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
Excuse me?
You want a cup of tea or something?
And winter?
So do you like your new room?
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Nicole?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Should I keep reading?
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Dolores.
Why?
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Do you have a room?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Tell me about the Ottos.
Have they ever been busted?
Need a hand?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Do you have the blood test?
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
So you're just the thing we need.
Are you expensive?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Yes.
You are?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
I was scared.
There wasn't time?
What do you remember about the accident?
What's that?
Pretty slick, eh?
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
She'll move away.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
But of course...
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Can I come out?  No.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
I know Steve.  No.
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Are you listening?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
I don't think so.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Back?
Don't you know who that man is?
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
If that's for me, tear it up!
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
We stick in each others craw.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
You going to work all day?
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Please... let... the kids... go...
Yeah?  Who sent you?
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
What does that mean?
Where we going?
Excellent.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
You will.
Pain causes it?
Will it melt in there?
No!
It must end here... or I am the future.
It, John.  Not him.  It.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
John, get out of the way!!
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
I have detailed files.
The CPU from the first terminator.
I must be destroyed.
It's finally over.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
And no elbows on the table!
What does he mean, too correct?
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
So, what does the Russki want?
What the hell are they doing?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
So what is it?
What?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Steve.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
How?
Who warned you?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
What telegram?
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Von der Null?
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
What?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
So, you never heard of him.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
You were in insurance before the war.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Alright, the beige one.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Good field-dressing.
Is this enough?
Not possible.
He'll find us, won't he?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
I can help you...
Did you reach the next girl yet?
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
Admittedly...
I could fight you on this.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Clean out your locker.
Excuse me, I need to explain...
I'm sorry, about this...
See you around.
Home.
You're the one who started running.
That's classic.
Where are we going?
Nice.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Okay.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
They're watching.
All I mean is... someone like you...
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
It's mine...
Guess you missed it.
I didn't know what else to call you.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
No.
Hey there, Nickie.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
For you.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
It's a profound life experience.
Do it for YOU.
Yeah, almost...
What have they been doing to you?
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
What?
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
It's different every time.
We provide whatever's lacking.
How long will these take?
Get rid of them.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
Drive in.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Didn't I give you two?
Dinner's in the oven.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
He hasn't called back.
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
And what kind of sleeper?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
And those are Luke's and mine.
It's not going to hold your weight.
Well, this lot is full!
Yeah.
You used the wrong test.
It's still an electric shock!
I, I just can't...
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
All right...
What happened after you smelled it?
I don't know.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
This is where we're going?
What happened?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
What do you do?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Good night, Theo.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
As soon as you get dressed.
Italian?
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Hey.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
CQ what?
Edward Rama?
I didn't expect anyone.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
What?
Has he?
That was one of them?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Steady on.
Too easy?
I've been wondering something.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Weren't you on a television series?
When did you get in?
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
I see.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
You don't seem bothered.
Tell us about it.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
I don't believe it.
I guess you're just habitual.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
Like what.
How we gonna get that lucky?
How'd you get in here.
So why would he want to see you.
Hello there.
I miss my kids.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Is he here?
You must know Ian.
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
...I stank, didn't I?
...You are ze fahzer?
Ah yes, a music lover.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
No problem!
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
How much to they want, Dave?
...You know... who *who* is?
Rye.
Where you going?
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Honey.
Should I... should I tell you why?
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
How did you get into the store?
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
Ed, how're you holding up?
That was quite something.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
This hair.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
...We goin'?
...I'm Crane.
Doesn't bother me.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
His eyes are open.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Someone broke into this room.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Yes.
Fifteen... what's next?
The body?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
What are we talking about here?
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
Like the claw.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
I'm coming with you.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
What's that?
We're not supposed to go back there.
Quiet!
Not that big.
They've got something.
Stop!
Argo!  Hobbes!
What do you make of it, Margo?
What kind of egg is it?
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
Where would we find it?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
They're all heavily armed.
That was D'Agosta.
Is there another way around?
What is it doing?
Help someone!
I don't believe it.
Where exactly?
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Close up?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
Welcome.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
Are we talking Emmies?
That's correct.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Who are you?
The creator of what?
I have a map.
The memory of who?
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
I've got to talk to you.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
What're we doing here, Truman?
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
What're you doing down here?
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Truman, that was our house!
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Do you live around here?
What am I doing here?
What is it you find incredible?
No, they don't.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
How can this be?
Who?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You looking for him for some other reason?
Have you examined them?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
You a reporter?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
I'm on the roof.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Had you.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
I wake you?
It's like jelly.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
What kind of infection?
He didn't mention a park.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
What?
It may be extraterrestrial.
Been where?
What do you think it is?
I have. I did. It's done.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
We're going to the morgue.
On whose orders?
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Miriam...
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I'd be there for him.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Damn him.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
What then?
Why'd you bring him here?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
What happened?
Agent Cole.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Agent Novak.
What about the cat?
Someone looking after her little girl?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Den leuten.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
No.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
...at all.
What's she talking about?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
When...what did you do?
Seemed like a good idea.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Wer ist da?
I'm going back home.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
...Headquarters.
...quarrel?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Yes.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
It wouldn't work.
A girl of spirit.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...excuse me.
Do you know his number?
They wouldn't know me.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Thank you.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Could he have been conscious?
The Roumanian?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
Harry...
That's all you meant?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Where are you staying?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'll share something with you.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
She is gone!
He tried to borrow money from us.
Did you sleep well?
Have you told someone?
I think so too.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
We lost our key.
No one follows that midrash.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Which is what?
Is he a Nazi?
What's he care about?
Who's Linda?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Where are they?
Fuck that.
No, I think you shouldn't.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
An investment banking house.
You wouldn't announce it?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
Is it okay if I record this?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I always won.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
How did you get the fucking number?
Don't tell me what I --
What part of Germany are you people from?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
Hello...?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Open it up.
That's all we've got left.
Mrs. Moebius.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Are you an artist?
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
So what?
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did you tell him?
Johana, am I boring you?
Did the driver really freeze?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
It can't be true!
He seems to have won it.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
The Mamma's there too.
Ten thousand.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Where did you get that?
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
And... does the voice come back?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
I don't have one.
That's good.
Enzo?
Madame...
Why?
Two years younger than you.
Here...  Here...
You still collect them?
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
I'm concentrating.
You were right.
... Push me back in the water...
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
You jumped in?
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
How are you?
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
What?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Assassin!
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
In my apartment?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
... And the new stereo.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Will he understand Spanish?
Wait!  Professor...?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
We do!
What are you doing here?
Esther!
You two know each other?
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Okay, what's the information?
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What should I charge?
You okay?
Then what do you do?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
They don't say it to me.
Where's that man?
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Something black - something on its way to you 
Don't look at it!
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
It was you.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
Yes. The lipstick.
You're too good to me.
No - not yet.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Mr Lombard...
Im really sorry you were not called...
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
How... When did you...
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
I dont.
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Something like that?
Dont you believe in simplicity?
To get me killed...?
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Crow what?
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
What...?
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Weve still got the Italian...
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Ever seen him before?
What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Piss off!
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Any friends?
The 1,000 is on account.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Problems?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
This car needs petrol.
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Trying to say something, Martin?
Five to three. Youre early.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Evening. Table for one?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
Who else knows about the boy?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Whats the date?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
Mossad?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
And I would like to see a priest.
Better today than tomorrow.
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
I am ready now...
Go onto the next question.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Do you have a sword?
Yes, probably... maybe...
No, I... I held it up to...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
The English??
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Thanks be to God.
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Get them out of here!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Does he have hair?
Is it long and hanging down?
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Wait, wait...
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
And... what does Jeanne think?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Do you know how to count?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Who gave you that horse?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Why were you yelling like that?!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
They won't come anyway.
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Yes...
But you already confessed this morning...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
My father's.
Is that bad?
Beautiful.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Only God knows the answer to that.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Dorota!
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
When's your baby due?
For what? For my tie?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
I'm on the run!
Halina?
We're recruiting.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Boys, boys...
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
You know what we do? We use psychology.
You sell anything?
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Where are you hiding?
What's happening?
Careful! Watch his hand.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
Which mountains are those dear?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
What for?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
You don't want to learn.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
What does she say?
He's given it to us.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Which way are the rooms?
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
Twist, you know this guy?
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Then why ain't he dead?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Looks like he's sulking.
Raise 500.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
You done?
You got a back door to this place?
Looks like he missed ya.
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
You weren't hired to miss him.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
What about this Rosebreen?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
She's got me worrying, too.
How are you?
Mind if I look around?
I can't.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
Oh!
How did you ever remember me?
Your father?
Why... in the heart.
She... she fell over backwards.
Hello, Dorothy. 
It's been the same one for three months.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
You've been there?
No proof?
What about this Nunheim?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
What're you doing here?
Are you kidding?
Well....
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
That's ridiculous.
But he's interested!
Why, you said...
I never had it.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Thanks, and goodbye.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
But what if you need more money?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
You don't say --
I see.  I see.
My wife.
It might.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Dorothy!  Is she here?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
All right - you didn't.
Who's that?
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
But it's Christmas now.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
You're a fine watch dog.
Who gave it to you?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Sit down!
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Well, don't they?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Why not?
The suspects!  They won't come.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Is that true?
I hope you're well.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Bonds, sir?
Home?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
What's in the other direction?
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Ready?
There's nothing we can do.
Not much of a pass.
Where'd they go?
You ready?
You're the one with all the ideas.
You got no reason to do that!
What happened?
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
She okay?
What?
Oh, God!  Oh God!
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
My leg is falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
They're doing more than slapping.
Must be a compartment.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
Wait.
What?
We should head Northeast.
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I don't want to die.
Sorry.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
What did you say?
Is that good, or bad?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
...Wes...?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
Well?
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Some good ones.
People are suffering.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
He says it's a box.
You get it yet?
Jaeger?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
You ever think about dying?
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Iraqis.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Yeah!  Yeah!
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Is there anything you do know?
So?
Think we can make it?
What do you think?
Maybe we should give him some water.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What time is it?
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
I'll try.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
no...no, no.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
Well?
Why did you have LUH come here?
You're in violation.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
I'm leaving.
That's not it.
Just look at all those people.
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
They're not here.
Coffee, Mike?
Just do it.
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
What was-? Why...?
What?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Which one's which?
How long were you hooked?
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
I terrible with mechanical things.
Ex-girlfriend?
Should we head for the Interstate?
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Good, now the other side.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
What's wrong?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Political.
Bev, you're the greatest...
C4, plastic explosive.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
I'm filing charges against that mother-
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
What was it this time?
Make an appointment.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
Eleven o'clock! 
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
Good morning, Major.
Like it?
Yes, Baron.
I would start with cocktails.
I want to see-- 
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Thank you, Major. 
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
The tennis player?
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Thank you!
I like you, Baron.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
Two fifty-three, five--
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
They're all right, aren't they?
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Five, seven, and nine--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
That's what you need!
What shade of powder do you use?
Yes.
Do you know my first name?
Oh? 
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
It's disgraceful!
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Good night. 
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
How much time?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
She's not on the starboard side either.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
You told me to change.
An accident?!
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Is this in any way unclear?
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
How you two doin'?
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
A whole ten cents?!
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Jack, must you go?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Are you nervous?
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
It's bad.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
You have to go for help.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I'm sorry.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Rose, get in the boat!
Hope we're not intruding.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
You'll excuse me. 
No-o!
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Don't be a c-a-t.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
A little.
What are you thinking?
How well do you know her?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Nix, the law!
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
My change.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
It's your deal.
I'm going to the show--
I'll go with you.
Hello, young fellow!
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Yes--Me--in person!
Hello, Denby!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Am I a member of this club?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
Yes.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Can you read 'em Jack?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
--you'd go with him!
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
I'm all right.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Oh, my God...
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
Come on, you...
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
That's the rumor.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
Not exactly...
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
Doc...
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
A which?
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
No.
Just answer.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Wyatt!  My God...
What can I get you?
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
What'd you do that for?
It's that woman from the coach!
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Look pretty rough.
What about all these saloons?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
What about the uranium?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
That's reassuring.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Where to now, Jimbo?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Bourbon. Neat.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Nice to run into you again.
No?
... Do you have a gun?
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Down?
What now? And don't give me some movie clich like 'trust me.'
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
What's your name?
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
The back-up does the same thing.
How sweet.
Is the helicopter ready?
Please sir. Please -
What about ID's?
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
It was nip and tuck.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
What, are you having another party?
What did you put on it?
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Man, act like this is your home.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Those boys never did have good luck.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
To infinity and beyond!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Yeah?!
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes, I can.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Well, thanks for the ride.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Hi!
B-3.
Are you peeking?
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
I dunno.
Oh, no!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
A lunchbox?!
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
You are a liar!
What the heck is up there?
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
W-w-w-we?
Bad news?!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
You're only a young thing.
Reprieve.
Surely she is older?
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
Did you do this?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
What?  What is it?
What is he planning on telling them?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Oh, it is?
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
You all right?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
I don't know.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Parents still together?
Private?
How are your grades?
What are you doing?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
Are you getting this on tape?
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
What's he doing up here?
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
You should feel good about this.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Oh, man --
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Who are these guys?
Did you tell him?
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Sorry.
No.
Well, it isn't.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
Are you getting out much?
Have you got any gear on you?
Now remember --
But try too hard --
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Running time?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
You know.
God, you're sick.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
What?
How much?
So?
But you don't have the money?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Sure.
Sounds great, Swanney.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Where did she come up with that?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
It could. Yes.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu, what are you doing?
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Following new course. Warp seven.
Shuttle en route.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
What's going on?
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
No, but you can bet they will.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Oh, God
What are you doing?
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
Not General Korrd.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
I believe I have found a faster way.
What is this?
Who are you?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Your vision?


I know you better than that.
I don't understand...
You did break in.
Your old files -- ?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
I want to go to his place.
Of what?
Beautiful!
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
This town's full o' live ones.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
User requests are what computers are for.
That was uncalled-for.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Alan!
How about over there...that empty memory?
You're alive!
What about our friend - Sark?
Not us, I hope.
A User -- in our world?
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
But-what if I can't...?
Wait...I need that...
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
You've grown, big program.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
You bitch.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Can you cover me for an hour?
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Harry!  Where are you!
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Station wagon?
Helen's going to be pissed.
Copy that.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
She could be telling the truth.
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
What did happen?
Not because you were attracted to him?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
Natasha?
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
No.  But I wanted to.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Boris and Doris?
Who's your little friend?
What's going on, Harry?
Like one?
Hello?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Did you read the papers yesterday?
You'll call me then?
What's happened?
To our assignment.
Gotten your mail yet?
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
Has he looked through it yet?
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Thanks a lot.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
I love to get pie after a movie.
What are your turn-ons?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
That's a long time.
Do you get paid a lot?
She OD'd, didn't she?
That dazzling imagination.
Who and what is a Drexl?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Yes.
I do.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
I think what you did was...
I think what you did...
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
You'd really do that?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Money problems?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
This is Drexl's coke?
Elliot what?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
No. But thanks.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
No. No, you don't.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
No. Not yet.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
I don't believe you.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
That was very good.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Nicholson and I.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
He knows.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
Do you live here?
Yes.
No.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
That's him.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
They forced me to take drugs.
Change what?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
Do you know what year it is?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
It's just a shot to calm you.
You used to call me "James".
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
Mason???
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
Just like that?  You were in prison?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Germs?!
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
What...???
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
Uh, that message...me?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
Nine thirty
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Hey!
What time is it now?
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
We ain't got no Beck's.
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
It's Grace.
It's nothing.  Really.
Where you coming from?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What do you do anyway?
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Take me with you.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
John, please--
Shit!
Where's the safe?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
The trunk.  It's locked.
Husband . . .?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
What should I do?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
You love her, but you hate her?
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Jake--
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
What happened to your hand?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
I didn't do anything.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
Got any cold soda?
Soda.  You got any soda?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Oh, Jesus.
I think I've heard that before.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
I wasn't doing anything.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Mister!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
A lot that means.
What the fuck do you want?
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
California...
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
What can I do for you, lad?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You meant it.
I need thirteen.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Great!
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
No! Okay! Okay!
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Got any cold soda?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
You've been around.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Nice place.
Where'd you learn to do that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
Are there snakes out here?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
What do you mean?
In <u>cash</u>?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
<u>Jake</u>...
Morning, officer.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
"Arkady"
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Heineken?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Is that the entire message?
I'm listening.
What about Jeb?
Oh shit...
Would you like to try going--
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
I don't know what you're asking?
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
He's doing well today.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
When?
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I'm going to go in.
I'm going to work out.
No.
I'll just shoot him once.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Where were you sitting on the train?
How so?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
You told them cowboys you had it.
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He tell you where them others is?
I thought... you was an angel.
Oh. How long I been here?
Yeah. See?
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Uh... a little, maybe.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Hit your finger, huh?
All week?
They really got all that money, them whores?
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Like I said, I...
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
What?
What'd Ned say?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
William Munny, yeah.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
Get some sleep, Kid.
It's gonna get riper yet.
Yeah, he's in there.
He's in there.
Did... you... get... him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
That was... the first one.
Take a drink, Kid.
You... gonna take... the money?
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
HEY, KID.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
I seen him.
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Did you... did you... ?
No... I meant...
K-k-kill somebody?
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
More.
Say, Ned... ?
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
I don't kill nobody without him. 
He's gonna die, ain't he?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Jack. What are you doing here?
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
Me too.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
You have to come.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
No killing?
We'll make it.
Keaton, I can't just -
with what?
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
What about Redfoot?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
When does he post bail?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
So this lawyer...
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
You're stalling, Verbal.
What call?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
Edie...
I knew him. He would never -
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Say it.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Anything special about the case?
We went to Code Blue...
Well, many reasons, actually...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Objection!
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
What book is that?
How old are you?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I did.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
That's not my handwriting.
I am seventy-four years old.
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I read the hospital report on your client.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
What is it?
I need an extension for my case.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
I can't guarantee that...
This is Miss Costello...?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
Not if you don't grow up...
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Dr. Gruber.
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
Uh ...
... now who is that ...?
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
So what?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Uh...the admitting nurse...
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I understand ...
... I understand ...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
What?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
I want to buy you a drink.
Dr. Towler...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
He won't talk.
How long have you been back?
And you like it.
Like all this.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
You want me to dress like her?
Well?
Where shall we go for dinner?
Can't you see?
We're going awfully far.
Scottie, please...!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
What are you going to do?
Do you remember where you were?
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
Oh... wandering about.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
No.
How can you be sure?
How old?
What are you thinking?
And no birds sing.
Where?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Tell me.
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
Here with you.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Let me go! Let me go!!
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
How do you know? Personal experience?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Well?... what'll you do?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Could be.
I think I can lick it.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Pop Leibel? Sure.
The poor thing....
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
Mm. Better.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
She died.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
She'll be out in a moment.
Well...
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
What did you say?
Don't point at me.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
I'm calling the police.
Her fucking head was caved in.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
That's one idea.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
No way.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
What is it?
What?
She's not here.
We need padded chairs.
Call 911.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Nobody knows she's here.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Easy Boyd.
Boyd...What have we done?
Take care of business.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
My what?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Nope.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
There's my point exactly.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Easy Micheal.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
May we have the rings please?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
What do you mean, you think so?
Photographer?
Florist?
Why did you forget the tent check?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
We've got problems here.
Will you please call the chair people?
That's sweet.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
No way.
What are you talking about?
You fucked a prostitute?
He kept saying he was protected.
So what do we do?
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Where did you get that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
That ought to be about the end of that.
No...No.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
That's a good one.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Stop this, stop this.
How long are you staying?
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
You must think I am a monster.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
How much is that?
She isn't my cousin.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
What do you know about me?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Yes. Why?
Is she coming back?
Are your parents alive?
It's a very big one.
What's going on, Moncho?
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
What?
How did you see me?
In English, please.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
HEY!!!
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
Should I have?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
SID  NO!!!
I am beautiful, aren't I?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
You all right?
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
She's beautiful, you know?
What does that mean?
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
We know you didn't kill those guards.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
There you go  best seat in the house.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
What if he's busy tonight?
It's the White House.
What about it?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.

We are virtually certain it isn't...
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...

Tell me again.

The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
We'll be back tonight.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
You're tired, Ronnie.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
War's over, Pal.

And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
"...where's my pill..."
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
My name is Ronald Brean.
Why do people go to war?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
What is it?
...this the Guy.
Where is he now?
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?

I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
Don't start, alright.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
So, where are we going?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
So what's the problem?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Where is it?
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I can't...and I won't.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Yes, I guess you're right
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Hello?
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Come on.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Sarah listen to me.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Of course you will.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
She said, "You know."  That I know.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Well maybe your wife...
You're the flower lady.
Would you like some iced tea?
Why are you here?
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
Well good.  So you're human.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Oh my god.  You bought it.
It's niiice.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
But Claire--
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I'm a terrible friend.
Jody he was lying.
What's their name?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's today?
Claire?
Whatcha reading?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
How are you?
It's just us now.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Claire...
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
"...for my father."
Did you tell her?
You didn't?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
He killed her.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Tonight?
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
I never said...
What?
The accident...?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
I'm sorry...
You know I am.
We walked all night...
You dropped a glass.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
Ow!
It's too rough.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
I'm cooking you dinner.
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Who the hel1 -
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
I don't want the -
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
uh - then he - be just -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
Only you...
I do not understand...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Harder...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
My jury's still out on that,
Just one.  The bar's closed.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Stop it.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Hello...?
Rowan...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
You sure...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Hey - you're bleeding.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
When aid you get home last night...?
Something's wrong with you.
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
Sounds good - thank you
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
It doesn't mention 'females only'
What are you doing?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Sugar?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
You've killed but you're not a killer
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
I don't like sugar
Don't you want me now LESLIE
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Who the hell was your father?
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
So far away? In Xenia?
Check this out.  Hurry!
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You'll never believe who's in there.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
You got everything you ever wanted.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
And I was wondering.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
The lesson being?
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
I-I don't have the keys.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Who exactly ARE you?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
Can you believe that was me?
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Great.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Me?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Well? What do you think of her?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Wow...you clean up nice.
You're amazing.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Come on.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
That's part of growing up, honey.
Well? Surprised?
You promise you'll finish school?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
I'm warning you.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
What are you doing?
My parents? What do you mean?
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
Talk to me Artie.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Did you try to fight him?
Try, Kelly.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
It's our job, Gloria.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You saw the news today?
If you want company...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
The teeth, were they...
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Kelly.  What is it?
Kelly...
How much?
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Nellie Gail Ranch...
No.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Didn't you see her this morning?
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Limestone quarry?
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
What was all that back there?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
This is good.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
I know!  I know!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
Are those just button buttons or...?
My God!  He's so excessive!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He calls it the Tarantula.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You've... done... this... before.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
The first.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Are you all right?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
This is something.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Sorsha.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
You!!
Hey!  Give me that baby!
She's a bird, Willow.
I don't know, Willow.
Who are you!  Who are you!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
I just wanted to test it first.
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Time is running out.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Don't let them hurt you.
So one of them got to him.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Who else knows?
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Where are you taking us?
Now what's the problem?
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Enjoying your reading?
The... bullets?
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Did you find him?
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
John said you're Amish.
Good morning.
Who was that man?
That has no place in this house.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He's not in this building.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Dorothy!
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Yes.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
If she?
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Run, Toto, run!
Toto's my dog.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
...Toto, too?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Yes --
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Aw, come, come, come --
Oh --
Oh --
...room --
...bed.
Oh -- 
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Where do you want to be oiled first?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh - I'll get it!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oil can what?
The other side....
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
...along.
Yes -- there --
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Stop pushing!
You humbug!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
I haven't slept in weeks.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
It's a whatzis.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
You don't get around us that easy!
Mr. Gale!
No, her dog!
That's right.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
It's a whozis.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What is it?
Nuclear.
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Old friend?
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Shell get over it.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Who is he?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
I dont want to be safe!
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
I dont know what youre talking about!
I could have given you the world.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Mother of God.
The Maidens Tower.
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
No idea who's behind this?
Walter --
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Its very strange.  Times flowing backwards . . .
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Damn straight.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
His what?
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
. . . What?
Laurie --
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
What's he doing?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Their real names, please.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
I'm terribly sorry.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Adrian.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
How will you fix it?
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Go to hell!
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Yorgi and Kirill.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Dude, what are you doing here?
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What are you talking about?
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
Where am I?
What are you going to do?
I'll find him.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
Oh, shit.
Frederick Frankenstein?
And who might you be?
What was your grandfather's name?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
MMMmm!
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Miss me?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
That's a tough choice.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Did you hear that strange music?
What is this place?
Hmm!
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
Original.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
What monster?
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Hello there.
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Ooh!
Look, Doctor!
It wasn't me.
Oh, Doctor!
All right -- give it to him!
Give him the sedative!
Just passing through the night.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I will.
His what??
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
I'm getting tired.
Look how far we've come.
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
